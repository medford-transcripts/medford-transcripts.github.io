<h2><a href="../2025-02-19_K4SSXzHHj90/2025-02-19_K4SSXzHHj90.html">City Council Governance Committee 02-19-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3175.817s">Is</a> that good?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3177.697s">I</a> live at 146 Pine Ridge Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3180.158s">Good</a> evening, members of the City Council Governance Committee, Chair Tseng, fellow members of the Charter Review Committee, and Medford community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3189.023s">As</a> you know, I served on the school committee for 32 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3192.724s">I</a> asked to be appointed to the Charter Review Committee when I realized there was no one with school committee experience on the Charter Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3201.349s">While</a> some of my former school committee colleagues may not agree with what we have put forth in the draft, <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3206.811s">that</a> you are reviewing tonight, rest assured that it has been put forth with deep reflection, not only my own, but with the very diligent subcommittee and the entire Charter Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3221.647s">As</a> someone who served with three different mayors, I strongly advocated for the mayor, whoever it might be, to remain as the school committee chair because the advantages are so strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3234.334s">As</a> a school committee member, I had access to the mayor at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3240.178s">Not</a> just me, every school committee member had the advantage of being able to discuss key educational issues in front of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3251.883s">being</a> present at the school committee meetings ensures that the mayor is familiar with all the issues in detail and has buy-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3261.848s">Our</a> charter subcommittee interviewed all three mayors and each underscored how important it has been or is for them to fully comprehend school committee issues, our school issues, especially given the significant percentage of the budget which is spent on education. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3281.699s">I</a> remember the frustration of my colleagues across the aisle, that is you, the city council members, in former years when mayors did not come before them. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3292.302s">You</a> never heard that from school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3295.203s">We</a> worked closely with the mayors and they had buy-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3299.804s">To</a> my former colleagues eager to do away with the role of the mayor as the chair of the school committee, I can only say be careful what you ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3308.311s">School</a> committee members play a very vital role in supporting all students and education, and that is enhanced when the mayor who recommends the budget is not distanced from the intricacy of the issues that become before the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3323.707s">Remember,</a> the mayor only gets one vote, not more, not less, than any other member.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3333.733s">Later,</a> I hope to perhaps address some of the other issues.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7316.231s">So</a> I wanted to address this issue of the autonomy of the school committee to pick their own officers or how that's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7323.912s">And</a> I will tell you that this comes from my long years of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7328.833s">And</a> one of the things that I understand is that power is just so sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7335.275s">And</a> if you would, I have seen that selection process happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7340.916s">And</a> I have seen very, very good people <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7343.491s">who</a> then decided they wanted to keep on being and locking out other members from getting an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7351.716s">I</a> think it's important that members of the body have an opportunity to be either, which now would be the chair and secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7368.087s">So</a> if you would, that part of this comes from trying not to prevent fiefdoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7373.428s">Now,</a> in the original charter, when I went to look at it, there was practically nothing about the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7382.51s">And</a> in this charter, there's not as much as I would like, quite honestly, because at the recommendation of the Collins Center, quite a bit was taken out that we had talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7394.513s">While</a> I certainly understand the argument of having the body be autonomous and make their own decisions, I've also seen the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7403.015s">And</a> we have to look at both positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7406.356s">Now</a> we're talking about chair and secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7410.157s">Now</a> the secretary role includes signing the bills on behalf of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7417.018s">That</a> is the current structure that we use in Medford is the secretary of the school committee signs the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7424.6s">And</a> once upon a time, I signed the bills for 10 years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7432.103s">It</a> is a damn good thing that I'm honest, because nobody should have ever possibly wanted me to sign the bills for 10 years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7442.187s">And</a> of course, I definitely invited my colleagues in and said, please take a look at what I'm doing, because I want to make sure that somebody else has eyes on this besides me. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7452.11s">It</a> is not always a popular position because it takes time, but there is also an added stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7459.593s">And</a> there are added stipends for the position of what used to be vice chair and secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7468.036s">And</a> in fact, I saw the recommendations that I think Councilor Bears put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7474.118s">It's</a> significant money. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7475.939s">I</a> think it was like an $8,000 stipend for these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7482.728s">I</a> am wanting members to have the opportunity to do these different roles and not just keep it so that one person develops power and fiefdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7495.846s">Now,</a> if you read it, a key word is consecutive. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7500.532s">I</a> didn't say you can only do it once when we wrote this language and you don't get to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7505.855s">I</a> just said you can't do it consecutively. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7508.897s">So</a> you can do it in, you could be the chair in year one, year three, year five. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7514.1s">You</a> could be the secretary then. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7516.442s">You</a> could alternate those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7518.303s">So</a> it's far from perfect, but I think it's better than not saying anything at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7525.007s">So</a> that is the thinking behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7526.97s">That</a> is the rationale as we spoke on the committee of saying, look, do we put this in now personally, and maybe it's my mistake because I didn't catch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7536.362s">But</a> I didn't think about it, I have experience as a school committee member, not as a city Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7541.228s">Because</a> quite honestly, I think you guys ought to rotate your chair, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7544.972s">I</a> don't like the idea of having one person be the chair every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7548.496s">I'd</a> much rather see it rotate around members. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7552.08s">And</a> that isn't to say that I don't want to see Council Bears not be the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.208s">at</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.929s">I'm</a> happy if he's chair one, three and five or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7563.071s">You</a> get my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7564.192s">I</a> just don't think that one person in our city government should have a lock on these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7570.458s">I</a> think it's important to let other members have a chance to get the experience of leading and being in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7579.785s">That's</a> where it comes from.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7601.607s">Okay,</a> I need to take a look because it was originally that's what our discussion was.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7607.091s">The</a> intent of being is that it would just, you know, because every two years you've got different people on the committee anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7615.038s">So</a> there's change, you know, so, but the idea was that not one person wouldn't have a lock on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7622.323s">So</a> I'll take a look.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7658.871s">Well</a> then don't put anything in the jar. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7660.672s">I</a> mean, you know, that's always a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7664.094s">Um,</a> you know, the, I don't, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7670.305s">how</a> else to go about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7672.426s">I</a> understand people don't necessarily agree with me, but some of those people may be the same people who have a lock on positions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7680.228s">And</a> I don't know if that's true or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7681.349s">I</a> don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7683.15s">But</a> I'm just saying that for me, I am looking at not creating fiefdoms of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7689.892s">I'm</a> looking at ways of giving other members opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7694.654s">It's</a> pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7696.014s">To</a> me, it's common sense.<h2><a href="../2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw/2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw.html">City Council Governance Committee 01-22-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2355.723s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2801.343s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4637.583s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10096.433s">Councilor</a> Tseng, did you want me to go ahead to address that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10107.899s">Well,</a> I think we certainly considered all the different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10112.783s">We</a> were concerned that not everybody, you know, if we looked over historically at where school committee members, what <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10123.992s">uh</a> wards they had lived in and we we were concerned in and and the way that our particular uh city there um we don't have a school in each ward so we were looking at school placements and how that worked and it it doesn't really correspond in any way and we were concerned i mean um <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10146.377s">Sometimes</a> there aren't that many people interested in running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10151.265s">It's</a> a very taxing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10154.049s">It</a> takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10156.502s">In</a> the past, the stipends were always considerably lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10160.364s">We</a> don't want someone running for position just because they want to collect the stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10166.246s">And</a> so after we discussed all of the different options, and then we started trying to say, well, if we were doing ward representation, what would happen if we had wards where no one wanted to be on the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10180.931s">And</a> we were concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10184.535s">You</a> know, after many different looking at this, this to us seemed to be an opportunity to certainly increase representation from different districts in the city, but also minimize other potential problems.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10681.716s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13173.419s">There</a> we go, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13175.68s">Councilor</a> Tseng, I just wanted to come back for just a second to say I became a little nervous as I was listening to the discussion that all of a sudden the comparison was to what the school committee subcommittee proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13188.152s">in</a> our particular part of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13191.754s">And</a> it is different than what was proposed for city Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13197.696s">That</a> was because we did see that there was different roles and really in some ways different populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13208.513s">I</a> wanted to say that I came slowly toward representation, but ultimately voted and supported it because as a member of the committee, and having attended many of the information sessions, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13224.743s">and</a> listening to people and talking to people in other communities, as well as having the discussions that we'll talk more about in terms specifically about the school committee, I heard from our citizens a great interest in having ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13243.578s">I</a> think, and as I served on the committee, you know, you could go nuts doing this because there's always one more thing you can do and one more thing and make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13255.062s">And</a> I absolutely believe that we're really all interested here in trying to come up with a good, positive solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13265.005s">And</a> we all understand that it's really time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13269.226s">So</a> there's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13271.637s">the</a> weighing between how much do we go back to the drawing board and do another something and another something and how much we move is, you know, the question is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13284.067s">I</a> just want to let the committee know that I came to appreciate ward representation, even though as someone who had ran and served our city for a long time, I loved representing the whole city, but there was much to be said for those other discussions and I don't want <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13300.581s">the</a> fact that we chose something different to put forward to you for the school committee to hamper the discussion or make anybody think that I was not a proponent for what the committee put forth overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13316.289s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-01-14_pVNz2f7XJUQ/2025-01-14_pVNz2f7XJUQ.html">Regular MSC Meeting - 01.13.2025</a></h2>

href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8042.73s">I</a> got them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8043.989s">Anyway,</a> what we've been very quietly doing for the last eight, maybe nine years is giving away money. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8051.672s">And</a> of course it always amuses me that we have to come and ask you to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8055.734s">This</a> amused me when I was sitting over there, because I would think you'd be so happy to take it you would just. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8060.976s">grab</a> it from my hands and no need for formal approval but I'm here to give you $8,755 tonight to go towards the grants that teachers applied for so they we have a process where they write us their good ideas and <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8077.722s">We</a> weigh and deliberate over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8080.664s">Very</a> often, we can't fund all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8083.085s">We</a> received more than $26,000 in requests, just to give you some idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8087.848s">So</a> roughly, right now, we're funding about a third of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8092.091s">But</a> last year, all together, we gave you over $16,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8093.932s">And</a> we're about on track for that this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8099.175s">And</a> the type of grants that we love to fund is, for your like example, the middle school librarians joined forces and asked us to fund a community read. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8109.899s">And</a> we think that's a wonderful project to bring the middle school students together. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8115.241s">The</a> Mississippi has asked us to fund, which we're partially funding, an author's visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8120.202s">They</a> haven't had one for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8122.623s">At</a> the vocational school, they asked us for a brand new upgraded 3D printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8128.725s">and</a> a much more expensive one than they've had, and we funded that at your last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8135.507s">You</a> okayed a field trip experience for the United Nations Club, and we're giving them $1,000 towards that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8145.129s">We</a> have an after-school cooking club at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8149.05s">We</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8151.05s">working</a> on international food. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8153.671s">And</a> so we're funding some of their expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8157.031s">So</a> that's the thing we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8158.512s">They're</a> not earth shattering, but they sure are fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8161.172s">And</a> we think that they add to a student's enjoyment. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8165.293s">And</a> we know from the feedback that we get that the teachers really present, appreciate having another funding source that they can ask to for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8175.435s">One</a> of the funds we just gave out was for 50 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8179.116s">And</a> a teacher said, boy, really appreciate that very small amount of money, but that's something we can do and something which, frankly, I know that doesn't always happen on your end because it's a different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8191.428s">So</a> anyway, we are very, very grateful to the people who support us. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8196.213s">Needham</a> Bank has been a great supporter of us, giving us over $5,000 for the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8201.498s">The</a> Medford Community Fund has also contributed to us for several years running after we've written for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8208.903s">And</a> we're really an intermediary. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8210.804s">We</a> collect money and we give it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8212.565s">As</a> soon as we get money, we give it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8214.706s">And</a> for that purpose, I'm going to let you know that the Kiwanis of Medford generously just let us know that we'll be receiving a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8223.872s">and</a> at your next meeting in two weeks time I won't come again but I will ask you there will be an additional there were a couple grants we couldn't fund that we really wanted to so you'll see us come up again just for your approval and we thank the Kiwanis and Needham Bank and Mr. Gene Kalaw from Needham Bank for their incredible support. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8245.703s">Anyway,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8247.631s">I</a> think that about covers it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8251.493s">It's</a> great to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8252.453s">I</a> have to always note that two of you used to be my students. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8257.835s">John</a> and Aaron both volunteered at Winchester Hospital when I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8262.677s">So</a> it does amuse me that you both ended up on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8267.419s">So</a> anyway, who's gonna take the check and make sure it gets to the right place? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8273.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8277.438s">And</a> again, I'd really like to thank the very dedicated crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8279.899s">We're</a> small, but we've been absolutely consistent for years working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8285.16s">And</a> David's done a phenomenal job, and Steve Hayes, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8289.04s">So</a> thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_ea2kg9eBURI/2025-06-26_ea2kg9eBURI.html">Community Development Board 10-09-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1500.391s">And</a> with that actually, oh and one other thing Adam, there was a note that Alicia and Danielle had suggested that we all send our cell phones to <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1512.651s">to</a> them so that they can compile it in case we're running late or anything, and they'll know that we, they'll reach out and see if we're coming to the meeting or whatever, so that they actually have that and we're not waiting, going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1527.438s">And</a> it's not so much just because, not because of your tonight, it's just to have it overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1532.881s">Because</a> sometimes we don't even know who's waiting in the waiting room if it's a phone number, so we try to match it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1540.945s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1542.618s">but</a> it's really short meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1544.759s">So</a> I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1552.222s">I'll</a> make the motion.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=827.089s">Yeah,</a> I was pretty going to say, pretty much going to say that towards the end, there's so many more beneficial aspects with having established site control, such as the adequate space to remove the parallel parking with the circulation and safer access regress. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=841.813s">And</a> then you have, not only do you have the required parking spaces for their residents, but you have given additional 27 for MHA employees and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=853.855s">I</a> think that it's just way more beneficial and <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=856.733s">I'm</a> glad that you were able to establish site control and I'm going forward just just reminds the board that we definitely need to start to do a condition for modifications for these sorts of things so that the proponents do not have to come back going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=872.564s">And</a> what's saying that and seeing no other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=874.465s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1351.463s">Alicia,</a> they meet every two weeks on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1356.166s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1774.694s">I</a> just wanted to clarify that it's Emily Keatons, the land use consultant and not our fabulous Vice Chair Emily Hederman that the city's working with.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1989.097s">And</a> without having to watch the entire meeting previously, Annie, or for anyone, the decision, I just approved and signed a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1998.164s">So</a> it should be filed with the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2000.566s">Danielle</a> did that prior to her leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2002.087s">And</a> if you want to see what came along with the decision, like the conditions.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2129.043s">Yeah,</a> their timeline was completely aggressive considering the circumstances surrounding <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2135.797s">some</a> of the things they had to get done, like MassDOT by itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2140.661s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1003.866s">Mr.</a> Sterianos, thank you for being here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1007.488s">I'm</a> going to have the city lead us and give us a brief discussion, a brief overview, and then we'll have you introduce yourself and the project, okay?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1142.404s">What</a> are the dimensions on this, Danielle?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1266.033s">So</a> it fronts on the right of way, has vital access, and it exceeds the minimum frontage requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1272.634s">So</a> those are the three requirements to remind the board that an A&R needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1277.235s">So</a> without further ado, if the board has no questions, I am going to ask for a motion to approve the A&R, although it doesn't need an approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1287.977s">Yes,</a> so the motion is to endorse. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1290.118s">To</a> endorse the A&R. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1299.974s">I</a> second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1303.517s">Do</a> I have a second?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1311.425s">I'm</a> going to do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1313.787s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1316.049s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1317.03s">Peter</a> Kautz?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1319.232s">Sabrina</a> Alpino? <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1321.033s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1321.814s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1323.195s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1325.329s">Thank</a> you so much, Angelo, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1328.23s">I</a> apologize, because I blanked on your surname that quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1332.671s">No,</a> not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1334.532s">Have</a> a great evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1335.953s">Thank</a> you for being with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1336.973s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1361.627s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1362.227s">Have</a> a good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1363.808s">So</a> the third item on our agenda is approval of minutes, but they don't appear to be ready.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1399.532s">And</a> so number four is zoning overhaul updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1402.032s">Danielle,</a> do you have anything for us?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1535.642s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1537.622s">And</a> just quickly to touch base, speaking on updates to zoning and so forth, Daniel, you were mentioning earlier about the housing bond bill that passed the new ADU law. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1549.385s">And</a> I'm not sure if you'll need the board to sort of help with that or if it starts in the planning office and what you'll be overruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1557.306s">I</a> do know that KP Law, this attorney from KP Law, is actually going to do like a lunch and learn to try to figure out what the <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1565.628s">the</a> law, the new law says, does, what's effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1568.83s">So</a> to try to kind of put it in layman's terms for us planners.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1622.621s">So</a> Chris Clutchman, um, actually, uh, who's already doing the MTA laws has mentioned something about, uh, something coming down the pipeline, but I have not heard anything official. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1633.672s">And</a> now that we're two separate secretariats, I, I don't have that information real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1639.197s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1640.618s">I'm</a> in a separate secretariat now, but I'm assuming that that's being worked on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1645.699s">And</a> I can get you all, I mean, you'll probably get the information as fast as I get the information, or maybe even sooner, because it's going out to municipalities as soon as possible.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1660.708s">When</a> I have not again, I have not digested even the bridge version of what was sent out by one of our not not all heroes wear capes and there is a planner out there who actually digested this information and put it into like a little compact document. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1678.267s">I</a> haven't even had a chance to read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1680.269s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1682.03s">All</a> right, I didn't want to drag on on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1683.531s">I</a> just wanted to know if there was anything that the board was going to have to do differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1686.472s">And</a> if that was, I know it's going to come down the pipeline because we just approved an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1693.695s">And</a> I didn't know how that was going to look going forward.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1715.579s">And</a> then just are. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1717.98s">The</a> 2nd item is how do we get these? <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1722.067s">to</a> an administrative process with your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1724.288s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1725.349s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1728.011s">I</a> don't know about the rest of the board, but... That's just gonna be a waste of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1733.314s">Yes,</a> it's just, it's one of those things where it's like, we rely on you, you guys, to give us the information for those three requirements that we hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1741.999s">So</a> if you know that they hit them all at that point, it's a waste of the, it's not the best use of the client's time, your time or the board's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1751.084s">It's</a> more of, again, not trying to put more on your plate, but how do we get those quick things?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1806.681s">Yeah,</a> rubber stamps, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1811.762s">Okay,</a> and with that, there's no other items. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1818.404s">If</a> no one wants to share anything, then I will ask for a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1826.927s">Okay,</a> your turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1832.318s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1833.879s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1835.26s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1835.46s">OK,</a> Sally Akiti? <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1839.582s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1840.423s">Peter</a> Kaufs?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1842.324s">Sabrina</a> Alfino? <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1843.905s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1844.785s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1846.166s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1847.026s">Thank</a> you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1847.687s">Have</a> a great evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1849.828s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1850.208s">Welcome</a> aboard, Sabrina.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=232.383s">Who</a> will be presenting for the applicant? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=235.225s">If</a> you can introduce yourselves and you can begin your proposal or your presentation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=250.111s">And</a> who's actually presenting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1097.77s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1099.59s">I</a> have a clarifying question on your plan B, if there was any feedback from Todd, the actual traffic engineer from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1110.452s">Daniel,</a> do you have that information, if there was feedback on that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1159.428s">Well,</a> the language can just cover that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1161.089s">It</a> would have to be in coordination with director Blake and MassDOT to make sure that it was at the city and MassDOT's standards or something to that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1199.247s">I</a> just want to make it as simple as possible, but at the same time, clarify it so that it can actually move forward easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1205.67s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1211.943s">Are</a> there any clarifying questions from the board before I open it up to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1229.79s">Peter</a> Kelce?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1263.398s">You</a> can send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1268.339s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record and remind all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1278.523s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1286.305s">Danielle,</a> can you manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1293.972s">It</a> doesn't look like we have any members on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.207s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.868s">And</a> I think we can officially close the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1315.932s">And</a> so that brings us back to the draft recommendation and conditions so better understand what we are moving forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1326.881s">Again,</a> if there's any questions or comments from the board at this time, before I move to motion or approve, are you understanding what we are working with now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1345.487s">And</a> Danielle, for clarifications on the conditions in the offsite, I am not sure what offsite conditions, Director Blake, that have not been addressed to include with the draft conditions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1467.057s">And</a> so for the draft recommendations from previously, these have been rectified for the most part as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1475.94s">We</a> had eight drafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1477.58s">And</a> I want to make sure that we're on the same page with the proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1480.788s">What</a> are the drafts? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1482.128s">What's</a> the remaining conditions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1597.624s">So</a> beginning from condition one, that was highlighted with control plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1602.825s">Plan</a> modifications have been resubmitted but have control plans.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1730.086s">And</a> then I'm just going to go through just to, so we're not, and then we came to number three on your end, requotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1738.84s">of</a> the builder permit?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1825.018s">Kirk</a> house, are you taking down the new conditions or you, um, as we go along, I'm just curious.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1849.829s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1850.189s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1854.012s">And</a> have we wordsmithed for that scenario? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1860.674s">We</a> have to decide on language regarding the MassDOT access permit for scenario two?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1996.977s">Okay,</a> so going over the conditions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2000.018s">want</a> to take a shot at the conditions before right before I recommend the motion for special event and the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2007.984s">Do</a> we want to take a shot to make sure that the board is okay with the conditions either the city or Peter

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=1128.747s">Okay,</a> this helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=1129.687s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=1537.123s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Noel.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2296.33s">Thank</a> you all for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2298.191s">We</a> truly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2300.292s">I'm</a> trying to, I know that there were some significant comments from Director Blake regarding traffic and he's not present with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2308.998s">And</a> you said that you had sat down with him as well as planner Daniel Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2315.101s">And</a> I'm just trying to figure out, I have not heard mention of an access permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2319.424s">Is</a> it true that you need a mascot access permit and that can actually dictate or impact <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2324.547s">the</a> recommendations by the city for what you need to do on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2329.291s">Can</a> you explain a little bit about that process?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2477.964s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Navarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2480.486s">I'm</a> going to open it up to the board for any further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2490.574s">Vice</a> Chair Feldman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2666.477s">Thank</a> you, vice chair, vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2669.56s">When</a> you, can I just, when you said EV charging stations, so the proponent does have EV charging stations on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2675.966s">Do</a> you want more in addition to? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2678.548s">That</a> was something that was proposed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2683.573s">Yeah,</a> so there are EV chargers, but I just wanted to, I didn't know if you wanted more in addition because they, they're, <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2690.719s">Director</a> Blake has also mentioned that he would like to see more as the need arises.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2706.602s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2707.342s">And</a> one of the things that, so speaking of that, I wanted to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2710.804s">I</a> had not, thank you, Vice Chair Edelman, for bringing up the also location. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2715.066s">So</a> that brings more traffic here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2717.027s">And</a> Attorney Marinelli had originally said that the traffic report said there was going to be 656 fewer uses than the former bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2727.051s">So</a> at this point, I'm just trying to figure out how that ties into the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2734.381s">I</a> guess this is when we need our board member, Peter Cowles, and understanding the impact in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2741.087s">So</a> I'm going to trust that you did your traffic report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2746.332s">I</a> don't get into that, but I just, I want to have a little bit more confidence that it will not trigger any kind of more traffic congestion there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2823.054s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2825.435s">I</a> know that there are sort of generic codes and it's kind of hard with the actual versus <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2833.1s">versus</a> existing conditions and trying to forecast for that traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2836.961s">So</a> me being a planner myself, I don't usually, traffic studies, they're very helpful, but just knowing the area itself, I usually look for other indicators of confidence, but I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2849.105s">I'm</a> going to go with board member, Ari Fishman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2980.557s">Yes,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2983.118s">Actually,</a> Director Blake has captured that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2985.699s">That</a> was one of my concerns, but it was something that was captured within. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2989.76s">And</a> so I guess at this point, I'm going to ask the city for clarification if there's anything that you wanted to add before I open it up to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3001.305s">Danielle,</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3250.327s">And</a> if there's a plan B, it would help with the process going forward because the board can vote on an administrative process for the city to actually, for planning staff <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3260.223s">to</a> approve as opposed to you coming back before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3263.386s">So</a> that's something to keep in mind if you do have a plan B. We've learned our lessons previously.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4449.837s">I'm</a> going to close the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4454.539s">And</a> I'm going to ask for clarification if the board has any clarifying comments or questions going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4463.202s">Just</a> to remind the board that we will not be voting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4466.563s">The</a> proponent will be coming back before us with revised site plans as per recommendations of Todd Blake and other department heads, including the PDS staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4477.027s">But</a> if there's any last <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4478.885s">other</a> additional recommendations you want to give before we continue their hearing to a date certain which would be June 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4504.008s">hearing</a> none, and actually before I ask for a motion, I just wanted to just circle back really quick to Mr. Cross and let you know that I definitely, I didn't want to put the performant on the spot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4517.712s">I</a> wanted him to take your recommendations into full consideration to be able to offer <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4525.147s">an</a> appropriate response for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4526.568s">So</a> that's why I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4529.469s">I</a> wanted to move it for them to think about it going forward with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4533.97s">So</a> coming back to June 26, if I can have a motion to continue the hearing for 400 Mystic Avenue to June 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4545.975s">I'll</a> make the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4547.996s">That's</a> Vice Chair Henneman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4549.316s">And</a> do I have a second motion?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4556.5s">Okay,</a> so that's, so roll call, Vice Chair Edelman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4562.665s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4564.086s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4565.627s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4567.808s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4569.229s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4572.312s">Thank</a> you so much, Attorney Ron Valley, Mr. Walsh, and all that have presented this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4577.015s">We</a> will see you on June 26th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4588.083s">Have</a> a good evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4598.132s">Danielle</a> has our I just want to make sure before I know we're going to do the next item, but just for the A&R is has the performance showed up for 79 Jeremiah circle?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4612.912s">All</a> right, so I am going to invite the board to present for 79 Jeremiah, just to remind the board that this is an approval not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4621.297s">We</a> are specifically looking to make sure that it meets the frontage right requirements and adequate access. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4629.921s">So</a> at that point, if I can, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4632.563s">Ibrahim,</a> if you can go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4638.706s">You're</a> on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4640.167s">Let's</a> see.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4801.681s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Ibrahim. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4810.357s">I</a> want to make sure that so this doesn't change the frontage at all does.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4869.355s">The</a> real lot line, so that does not affect access. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4874.238s">Can</a> the city help me with this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4876.079s">It</a> does not sound like it's affecting access at all.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4881.442s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4910.177s">Okay,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4911.098s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4917.311s">To</a> clarify for the board, basically, again, we're looking at the front on the right-of-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4924.354s">Does</a> it satisfy the minimum frontage requirements, which is 35 feet at least? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4929.056s">And</a> is there vital access to the lights provided? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4932.137s">And</a> based on Mr. Ibrahim's presentation, I would ask for a motion to endorse the plan as an A&R. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4940.921s">I</a> don't see any other reason not to.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4952.181s">It</a> doesn't need approval, but it needs an endorsement for not needing approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4960.249s">Yes,</a> Vice Chair Herman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5218.47s">Yeah,</a> this is what I'm looking at.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5229.199s">I</a> just want, that's what I'm trying to double check as Lily was asking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5277.238s">One</a> second, Mr. Abraham. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5278.698s">Abraham,</a> before you leave, we just wanted to make sure we got Vice Chair Hederman's, we still haven't voted as a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5285.66s">Oh,</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5286.8s">This</a> is all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5287.32s">No,</a> it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5288.42s">No,</a> it's totally okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5289.721s">She</a> had a great, Vice Chair Hederman brought up a great question, and I knew that I had seen something on the site plan, but it's, I think it was just the way that the information was presented, and so now we're all back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5301.903s">And</a> I can ask for a motion to endorse the ANR 47 and 9 Jeremiah circle.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5310.326s">And</a> can I have a second?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5314.067s">Oh,</a> Sally can have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5317.768s">And</a> so roll call vice chair Hederman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5320.729s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5323.529s">In</a> Arby Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5325.31s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5326.21s">Sally</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5326.95s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5329.425s">and</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5331.616s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5371.982s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5372.382s">Have</a> a great evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5377.874s">Okay,</a> so the next item on our agenda for this evening is zoning amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5381.736s">And</a> I believe there was a city council paper number 24-033 where they refer it to us for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5389.779s">And</a> I will read the public hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5392.5s">The</a> Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 5th, 2024 at 6.30 PM via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5399.267s">remote</a> video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5405.092s">One,</a> amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5415.782s">Amending</a> section 94-12, which is definitions, to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5423.649s">Number</a> three, adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5427.491s">Adoption</a> of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to the zoning of any parcels within the city, but is intended to confirm the best information available to the city regarding the existing zoning destination for all properties in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5443.038s">Number</a> four, amending sections 94.1-4, 94.6.3-3, <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5452.17s">section</a> 2, 9411.7.2, section 4, and 94-12, to exempt municipal uses from certain use parking and dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5465.919s">A</a> link to the public hearing is posted on the city's website at medford.ma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5473.924s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to request at this point for Alicia or Danielle to please give us a <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5481.458s">to</a> introduce the consultant and to give us a brief update or introductory comments.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5571.169s">And.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6194.611s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6199.394s">I</a> think at this point, it's preferable if you just go through everything, and I guess we can ask questions at the end.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6640.443s">Anyone</a> unmute me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6641.303s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6643.324s">We</a> appreciate your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6645.845s">At</a> this time, I'm going to defer to the city and see if you want to add anything before I open it up to the board for clarifying the questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6824.019s">I</a> do have, I just wanted to know in the definitions, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6828.901s">Stenz,</a> you had said that the factory built versus manufactured, the only difference was that one was built in a factory and put on site, and then one was actually built on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6841.066s">I</a> could have that backwards, or did I get that wrong?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6918.706s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6919.926s">In</a> the manufactured homes, as far as like utilities and things like that, that usually doesn't have a basement because it's manufactured offsite, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6927.328s">Utilities</a> go replaced with a basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6929.848s">I'm</a> just trying to follow with the definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6931.829s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6948.912s">Does</a> the board have any other questions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6970.146s">And</a> for myself, too, having followed this with Danielle and Director Hunt, I just <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6977.006s">I</a> just wanted to appreciate all the work that's gone into it and I wanted to encourage the board to take Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6982.995s">Enns</a> up on the recommendations as Director Hunt has been asking us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6987.461s">I</a> know that I wanted to dive into the site plan changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6992.629s">try</a> to get some feedback on things where, why do we do things a certain way? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6997.474s">Can</a> some things be done administratively through the PDS and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7001.178s">I</a> just have not found enough time in a day to get that, but I encourage us all to sort of think about how we can be more helpful in that process going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7013.054s">And</a> with that, I don't have any other questions myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7015.596s">I</a> do know that I have to open this up to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7018.98s">And</a> before I do that, I wanted to see if the city has any other questions or comments at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7035.67s">All</a> right, I am going to open up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7038.592s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature and message Danielle with a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7042.956s">You</a> can also send an email to ocd.networkopenma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7047.359s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7051.122s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7057.827s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7065.867s">Danielle,</a> do you have any previously sent emails or comments?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7086.56s">Okay,</a> then I will close the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7091.39s">And</a> at this point, if the board has no final comments, I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend to the city council, recommend approval of proposed amendments to the city council as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7107.263s">Actually,</a> if the city can help with this, we would recommend also to add the footnotes as brought up by Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7115.769s">Director</a> Hunt, if you could actually help us to wordsmith that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7120.186s">Revision.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7153.721s">And</a> with that, can I actually ask for a motion to recommend with direct the recommendation, uh, the approval of the proposed amendments to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7166.306s">I'll</a> make the motion and a second motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7171.789s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7173.91s">A</a> roll call, uh, vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7177.471s">Hi,</a> Sally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7179.092s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7181.995s">I.</a> Ari Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7184.476s">I.</a> And myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7186.836s">I'm</a> an I.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=118.25s">Continuing</a> to our first item this evening is 290 Salem Street, which is being continued on 417 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=127.071s">Um,</a> it's a site plan review for special permit to allow the construction of three-story mixed-use building to contain seven residential units above ground for commercial space If we can please get a brief some overall summary Before the proponent goes if the city can please provide that update Um, yeah, so
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=183.647s">Okay,</a> and if I can please have the applicant present any changes that you may have.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=556.577s">And</a> I really appreciate everything and and any questions anyone has we'll be happy to answer Thank you very much jacob But before I open up to the board, I just want to commend you guys on <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=577.841s">The</a> differences between the first plans and these plans are significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=582.882s">It</a> may not be 100%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=585.123s">But</a> it's also at the point where we can see how much you've worked with the city to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=591.024s">And</a> I, for one, can appreciate that, especially with that curtain wall corner that we were concerned with the privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=599.406s">And</a> then the whole idea of the <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=603.74s">how</a> an actual passerby will see the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=607.162s">So</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=608.682s">I</a> will open it up to the board for any other questions or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=619.767s">No</a> questions or concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=623.609s">No</a> follow-up questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=628.23s">Does</a> the plan address overall concerns for the board?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=685.116s">Does</a> the city have any advice on that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=740.451s">And</a> as for the special permit, are we still concerned with the parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=744.774s">That's</a> one of the questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=747.837s">I</a> know that there was maybe condition tenants <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=753.37s">only</a> of that particular address could use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=756.512s">Is</a> that something that we're still working with?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=895.098s">Hearing</a> no further, seeing no further questions or hands raised from the board, because it is a public hearing, I will open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=906.053s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=910.156s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at MedfordMA.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=914.28s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=917.322s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=924.168s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=932.425s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=988.523s">I</a> will close the public comment period for this meeting and open it back up for deliberation between the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=995.698s">One</a> of the things I wanted to leave with is I remember hearing this previously, and it was conditioned to the point where it was almost a different project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1005.061s">So</a> the fact that the applicant has addressed all of those issues and the concerns regarding the staff who has worked with the city, as well as addressed all of the additional input from the board, I have nothing further. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1022.75s">So</a> at this point, if the board has anything further to say, other than that, I would look for a motion for the first part to approve the site plan for 290 Salem Street.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1102.443s">Because</a> the special permit is for retail uses until the city updates are allowed for that corridor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1110.398s">Is</a> that what we're doing a special permit for? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1112.799s">Yeah,</a> the special permit is for the, so it'll be retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1117.92s">So</a> you're asking for us to condition a space, a parking space we save for that commercial use?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1146.135s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1146.656s">No,</a> I was just waiting for you to. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1152.28s">Peter</a> Calves?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1167.593s">Peter,</a> can you actually read what you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1170.874s">so</a> far?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1230.957s">And</a> so for the board to discuss the condition as recommended by director Blake, that would not be captured in recommendations that would have to be fleshed out for the parking space.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1256.35s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1256.97s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1257.991s">And</a> so how does the board overall feel about? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1262.452s">Director</a> blake's Recommendation to condition a parking space for commercial use only Director blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1280.778s">I</a> don't know if you want uh, uh, pardon me, uh vice chair heteman
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1322.393s">I</a> have no opinion either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1326.175s">Either</a> way, I was going to offer if Director Blake could better explain that condition and reasons for it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1393.801s">Thank</a> you, Director Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1396.664s">Ari</a> Fishman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1452.355s">Vice</a> Chair Heidemann?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1544.12s">Vice</a> Chair Hanneman, did you want to speak again?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1580.568s">Director</a> Blake.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1644.478s">So</a> it sounds like overall for the board, for this item, we're gonna defer to the applicant, the property owner to handle the parking in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1665.029s">So</a> for the criteria to approve the site plan, if I can, Peter, not to put this back on you, but as the clerk, <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1672.962s">If</a> I can ask for a motion with the conditions that you have collected, it seems as though the city is okay with those conditions as stated previously.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1729.889s">Is</a> there a... So that's PETA's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1734.494s">Is</a> there a motion to accept, a second motion?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1741.441s">So</a> going back, Vice Chair Emily Hederman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1746.406s">Yes,</a> we're going to vote.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1748.128s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1749.329s">PETA</a> cows? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1750.891s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1752.722s">Maryasky.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1753.443s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1755.124s">Ari</a> Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1756.766s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1757.707s">And</a> because I was absent during the last meeting, but I have, I am attestant to the fact that I have watched the meeting in full. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1765.874s">I</a> am, I am also now eligible to vote and I'm an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1773.042s">Now</a> to discuss, this is also a special permit to make sure that there are no adverse effects that will outweigh the beneficial impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1783.484s">And</a> that's looking at the social economic community needs, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities and public services, compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood, impacts on the natural environment, and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1803.957s">What</a> I can say is that it's way better than what's there now, and it will definitely transform the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1809.06s">So</a> I would look for a motion to approve the special permit to allow for the retail use at 290 Salem Street.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1825.709s">A</a> second motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1830.798s">I</a> ask for the motion, then a board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1833.3s">I</a> can't give the motion myself, so Peter has given the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1836.083s">I</a> second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1839.906s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1842.928s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1844.47s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1847.713s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1849.254s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1850.255s">Pam</a> Marianski? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1852.336s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1853.197s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1856.588s">Thank</a> you, Attorney Banowski and to the applicant and everyone else that represents the applicant, we appreciate it.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2329.556s">Although</a> we saw this a while, I will tell you that this came in so late that I have not wrapped my head around the differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2337.417s">It</a> would help for me anyways, just to help to speed this a little, to provide more time, not without just in haste. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2347.219s">I</a> don't wanna do anything in haste, but at the same time, I need to be able to wrap this around my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2353.04s">Can</a> you please compare the changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2354.56s">I</a> need to better understand what these changes are.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2443.832s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2451.262s">Director</a> Hunt.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2626.159s">I'm</a> trying to figure out egress. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2628.02s">And</a> it's kind of hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2631.824s">That's</a> the one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2633.925s">So</a> what's the egress situation?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2704.03s">And</a> not because it's in the same family, but Danielle, if I'm not mistaken, Atlas is built the same, right turn only, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2711.233s">When</a> you come out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2727.816s">You</a> can turn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2815.455s">Sorry,</a> I got held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2817.919s">I</a> was looking at the transportation so you can however you want to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2821.884s">I</a> just wanted to there was some clarifying questions to wrap my head around.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3141.909s">Speaking</a> with Danielle earlier, one of the concerns that I had with that actual option would be that the back of Mystic Valley Parkway or Route 16, the way it merges with that exit on I-93, that would be putting a lot of traffic, spilling a lot of traffic out at that traffic light coming on to Mystic, before you get to Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3163.299s">It's</a> just the way Mystic Valley Parkway is set up, period.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3276.398s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3277.459s">Thank</a> you, Director Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3279.901s">Director</a> Hunt?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3359.998s">Yeah,</a> no, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3363.748s">And</a> I don't wanna speak against the state because they're there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3366.77s">Me</a> working for a state, a fellow state agency myself, I definitely understand, but I will tell you that economically, it could kill a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3375.795s">And</a> unless the city is looking at a feasibility of a traffic study for the entire strip where others can actually come in and pay for the impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3385.101s">And</a> just, I can't even imagine what an access permit, not adding costs, but at the same time, adding time to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3393.317s">I've</a> just taken that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3396.019s">It</a> could, in the future, be like a, I'm not sure how the proponent feels about that anyways, but just in my experience, I know that it could be cumbersome. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3413.192s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3659.289s">No,</a> I missed his author. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3661.51s">I,</a> I, myself as just one board member, I wouldn't be comfortable conditioning that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3671.415s">Are</a> there any comments or concerns from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3673.736s">Uh,</a> yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3939.25s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Blake.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3995.557s">Before</a> I open it up to the public for comment, are there any other questions from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4000.342s">I</a> do see that we just had a couple of people, I'm not sure if there's public, so I'm going to open it up at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4015.753s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4020.375s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4024.597s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4028.079s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4035.123s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be intervened through the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4042.93s">Daniel,</a> can you please manage the comment queue and read any previous letters or emails that you've received prior to this meeting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4068.341s">Awesome,</a> then I can close the public comment queue <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4073.092s">for</a> this meeting or the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4078.675s">And</a> I'll go back to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4080.577s">For</a> the city, can you actually provide us with the original? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4083.478s">I</a> know that there's some conditions that are no longer relevant with these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4088.582s">Can</a> you remind us of what still stands?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4410.045s">Danielle,</a> did you provide us with these conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4414.247s">That's</a> what I'm looking for.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4859.743s">Yes,</a> and before Ari goes, one of the things I wanted to note, Director Hunt, is that I haven't been properly prepped on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4867.466s">I'm</a> not sure about the rest of the board to know even how to discuss conditions going forward, is what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4873.248s">I</a> don't know what the department heads, I don't remember, recall what the department heads' suggestions are going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4879.35s">So</a> that's the problem I'm having. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4880.951s">So</a> that's what I was trying to see.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4934.658s">The</a> beauty of what you have just said would have been relevant in a PDS memo prior to this meeting, and we could have been prepared.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4947.744s">No,</a> and I definitely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4949.225s">But</a> when you said fair, it would have helped to be more fair of everyone's time across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4956.168s">Ari</a> Fishman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5020.287s">Director</a> Boyd?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5067.841s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5071.923s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5211.776s">Thank</a> you, Piotr. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5212.576s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5303.084s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5304.165s">I</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5305.425s">And</a> trust me, I definitely, I sympathize and I empathize with the lack of capacity on your end. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5312.449s">And</a> I'm not placing fault at this point at all, but at the same time, the owner should not be on the board to try to speed through something that we're not able to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5321.173s">And</a> we understand that it's also not the applicant's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5323.895s">There's</a> no fault being placed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5325.315s">I'm</a> not even gonna blame MASCA. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5327.096s">They're</a> doing their due diligence, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5328.717s">It's</a> one of those things where I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5330.758s">It's</a> so complex, there's layers to this, and I'm just trying to better understand so that I can lead the board in making a decision forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5339.121s">And</a> I understand it's not fair to anyone across the board, whether it's the city, the applicant, or the board, in trying to rush this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5347.004s">I</a> just need to know the best path forward.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5364.511s">Sal</a> DiStefano?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5482.159s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5484.459s">Peter</a> Cowles.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5548.417s">Thank</a> you, Director Blake.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5712.988s">Thank</a> you so much, Director Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5714.749s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5740.384s">Yeah,</a> it's a very difficult situation, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the board, again, the onus is neither on the board to make a decision without having the proper information going forward, because it wasn't our fault either. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5753.168s">So</a> it's unfortunate, but the onus is not on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5763.086s">However,</a> in saying that, I will ask if the board wants to discuss these additional conditions, if there's something that we can come up with that is agreeable with both the board and the city that can make sense that we can capture to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5786.51s">Danielle?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5935.437s">So</a> we can condition it to make sure that the applicant is working with the city staff or department heads to move that forward, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5945.34s">To</a> flush that out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5991.741s">So</a> I guess I'm. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5994.963s">Peter</a> cows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6119.816s">I'm</a> sorry, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6120.856s">Did</a> you mention the actual signage, the wayfinding as recommended?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6140.759s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6145.021s">Ari?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6146.402s">Ari</a> Fishman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6192.348s">Thank</a> you, Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6193.069s">I</a> think that's what I meant by going back to the city staff and make sure that there was a minimal agreement on what was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6201.035s">Maybe</a> I left that too broad.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6225.375s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6226.416s">Pena</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6277.765s">Mr.</a> Zartha, before we ask for a motion on those additional conditions to approve your amendment, are you okay with those conditions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6305.062s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6305.923s">And</a> again, it's just to explore that the fact that you're even going to try.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6310.506s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6311.146s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6318.422s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6348.766s">The</a> board in our position, you would use it as a condition, but would that be PDS staff that would make the recommendation for why?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6443.127s">And</a> then I can only imagine that the board's recommendation to explore that would back that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6449.373s">I</a> think that's sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6453.378s">Okay,</a> so I am going to ask the clerk for a motion to approve the amendment to the site plan as he has already recited conditions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6514.027s">Okay,</a> can I have a second?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6520.835s">Okay,</a> so Peter Kelce?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6526.501s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6528.343s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6529.124s">Pam</a> Arianski? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6530.726s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6531.687s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6535.691s">Thank</a> you for your patience, Mrs. Arthur. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6538.013s">I</a> hope that it is going to be a little, you know, smooth sailing from here for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6543.117s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6543.557s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6551.864s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6552.584s">And</a> I think we're all waiting for it to open. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6554.126s">Trust</a> me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6557.748s">Have</a> a great night.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6564.885s">The</a> next item on our meeting is approval of minutes from 5-1-24. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6569.548s">Can</a> I have a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6574.951s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6576.092s">Oh,</a> I'll second. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6578.033s">Okay,</a> roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6579.974s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6583.296s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6585.017s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6585.637s">Pam</a> Baranski? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6587.438s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6588.099s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6589.459s">I'm</a> an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6590.912s">And</a> so number four would be zoning overhaul updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6594.713s">Alicia</a> will provide an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6596.694s">Director</a> Hunt.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7232.092s">So</a> May 22nd is the first, is another city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7235.793s">What</a> are they doing at that meeting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7302.838s">And</a> that's just to get moving for the packet is not gonna come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7307.1s">So</a> I'm trying to figure out the tasks that are coming down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7311.202s">May</a> 22nd is a meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7350.479s">May</a> 28th is when we'll be getting the packet that they're going to refer back to us for the zoning amendment changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7356.16s">And</a> then they're going to want that back by June 5th, you say?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7563.565s">No,</a> it's giving me context for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7567.647s">I'm</a> not sure about the other board members.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7598.843s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7599.784s">So</a> we get it on May 28th and we meet on June 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7603.105s">So</a> we'll be meeting to discuss city council's recommendations to get it back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7608.648s">Is</a> that how? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7609.869s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7660.278s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7668.868s">And</a> are there any other updates from board members? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7671.751s">Any</a> other questions that you have for city staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7679.152s">Well,</a> I just want to say that I obviously, I am very appreciative of all of you, but I have to give a special shout out to Peter for the way you captured those conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7688.155s">Because</a> I stare and it's like I fumble. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7690.736s">And</a> I'm trying to capture them myself on this end. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7693.237s">And</a> it's like, oh, you read them back. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7694.898s">I'm</a> like, wait, that's not what I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7697.339s">So</a> I really appreciate your diligence in getting them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7708.995s">Okay,</a> in saying that, the final item is a motion to adjourn.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1129.649s">The</a> corner, I am a little concerned about too, but it's a lot better than what we've seen previously.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1427.595s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1428.135s">Okay,</a> I'm going to go to the board and I see Emily and then Pam after.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1593.314s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1595.115s">And</a> next is Pam Marianski.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1671.057s">Thank</a> you, Pam. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1675.401s">This</a> is information to take in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1678.663s">It's</a> given the applicant a little bit of idea of how the board will move to vote in a future meeting, because we know that you still need variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1692.39s">So</a> if you're not prepared to answer board member Marianski's question now, just keep it in the back of your head that that is a concern that one of the board members has. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1702.605s">And</a> then, okay, so we'll go to board member Ari Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1708.412s">Thank</a> you, Chair.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1898.602s">And</a> we have Vice Chair Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1900.143s">You</a> can go right ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1958.057s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1959.441s">So</a> I am going to open up the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1964.473s">So</a> those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1969.054s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1974.696s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1978.718s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1985.88s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1994.376s">Depending</a> on the number of comments, we'll go two to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1997.458s">And</a> Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2006.003s">There</a> was a comment in the chat that I'm not sure if that participant is still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2014.107s">I</a> think we can stop that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2017.389s">Cheryl</a> R., did you want to read out your question before we begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2030.46s">Okay,</a> Danielle, I can't see anything else.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2201.662s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2316.96s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2320.823s">And</a> you don't have any other comments to read, to share, and there was no hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2330.005s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2336.449s">And</a> to bring it back to the board, and so we're not voting on 290 Salem Street this evening, because as I mentioned earlier, they still need variances, but we want to give them an idea of what's acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2352.678s">and</a> to give them some feedback if there's gonna be additional changes before they go off to the ZBA for me and before they wind up coming back before us if those variances are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2366.784s">I</a> have no further comments other than just making sure that you're being in tune with the department head comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2376.389s">And</a> I have no comments until that's handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2378.97s">I</a> don't know if the board has any other comments that they wanna share. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2383.175s">for</a> this evening for 290 Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2391.659s">Hearing</a> none, I am going to ask for a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2395.041s">Chair,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2397.022s">Yes,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2415.34s">And</a> that would be, do we know that should the applicant come back before us for once we can vote, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2424.824s">But</a> because we're not voting this evening, I didn't reiterate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2431.324s">So</a> with that, we will vote to continue the meeting to a date certain after their ZBA meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2551.934s">It</a> makes a lot of sense and I appreciate you asking for clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2556.077s">So</a> basically where I was going with it is based on the comments that the board has made tonight, I would have the applicant make definitely make sure that they're keeping the design wall in mind and then knowing that there's going to be a condition for parking coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2570.568s">if</a> this board was to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2572.309s">But</a> other than outside of that, I think the actual stance right now is that this is an acceptable plan going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2580.912s">I</a> mean, I can't vote by myself and I can't vote without ZBA's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2586.014s">However,</a> I think we pretty much gave you the idea of how we would vote going forward, just with the feedback that we gave tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2693.092s">What</a> I can tell you, and I'm not sure if this is even legal or permissible, but at this time, I would ask for a motion of approval with a couple of conditions that doesn't necessarily significantly change the architectural structure at all, and definitely not the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2715.227s">And</a> I'm trying to give as much headway as possible without voting and without speaking for the entire board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2726.028s">So</a> if we're allowed to, yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2857.737s">And</a> I definitely understand because they're not able to grant a variance that would be detrimental to anything that we've actually changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2864.942s">And</a> I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2867.123s">I</a> just, at this point, Director Hunt, my hands are tied as far as how we can help the client going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2875.669s">Legally,</a> I don't know what can be done.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3108.85s">Yes,</a> those are the only two conditions that I have from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3111.351s">And</a> then anything that needs to be addressed from the department heads, which at this point, I'm not able to decipher myself.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3193.946s">Oh</a> yeah, and I was very much aware of that, but I'm not sure that we're asking to change setbacks on that corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3202.581s">I</a> don't think any board member had an issue with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3203.921s">At</a> this at this point, especially with their being limited open space, and then there's retail on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3208.942s">I</a> don't think any board member had an issue with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3293.562s">Yeah,</a> and again, just to echo that and to re-clarify again that if another board was to grant the variances with the architectural features that we've seen before us, we understand that it would be detrimental if we change anything later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3311.972s">I</a> don't see this board changing anything that would be detrimental to those variances.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3341.808s">Yeah,</a> just to be safe, I'm going to ask for a motion to send a memo to the ZBA through the PDF staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3350.342s">on</a> behalf of 290 Salem Street, letting them know what conditions we would approve the site plan and special permit with? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3363.252s">I</a> so move. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3365.213s">And</a> a second?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3369.036s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3372.759s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3375.421s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3376.982s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3377.723s">Pam</a> Mariansky? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3379.304s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3380.356s">and</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. And now I believe we need a motion to continue 290 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3388.083s">Does</a> it have to be a date certain, Danielle, or just to the next meeting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3407.009s">Okay,</a> a motion to move 290 Salem Street to the next meeting on April 3rd, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3414.713s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3418.975s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3422.036s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3425.118s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3427.779s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3429.3s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3430.05s">Pam</a> Arianski. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3431.691s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3432.612s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3434.954s">And</a> I'm not sure if I said the language properly, it's to continue, not move, but it's the same, I hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3441.879s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3442.859s">Thank</a> you, attorney.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3449.164s">Have</a> a great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3454.268s">The</a> next item, I believe, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3460.357s">The</a> next item is 4864 Commercial Street, which is a site plan review to construct a two-story, 97,857 square foot research and testing laboratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3473.776s">I'm</a> going to read the public hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3475.958s">The</a> Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on March 20, 2024, after 6.30 p.m., via Zoom, remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review for a new non-residential structure of more than 10,000 square feet, which is a major project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3491.769s">It</a> was submitted by Empire Management Corporation of 171 Great Road, Akinas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3497.373s">The</a> applicant is seeking to demolish the existing structures, a construction staging yard, 48 Commercial Street, and a vacant industrial building, 64 Commercial Street, and construct a two-story, 97,857-square-foot research and testing laboratory, which is in allowed use in an industrial zoning district at 48 to 64 Commercial Street, Medford Mass 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3523.893s">Our</a> board is the site plan review authority per section 11-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3526.956s">PDS</a> staff, can you make any introductory comments, please?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3615.893s">So</a> to make sure here, the board would definitely need to see final plans to vote going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3622.858s">We</a> can open up the public hearing this evening to hear the applicant, but we would be voting on final plans since there's some back and forth with the city, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3657.21s">And</a> I think that's what we need to be clear of, because when it's conditioned to the point of change, then that means we should have a final set that we're voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3671.447s">OK,</a> we'll hear it going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3673.994s">I</a> believe the tiny dash, you could go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3734.095s">And</a> before you continue, Attorney Dash, I'm not sure about everyone else, but I'm having a hard time hearing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3739.42s">And</a> I thought it was my audio, but then someone else just spoke.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5592.668s">I</a> do have some clarifying questions, but I'm just not sure where the conditions lie at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5601.534s">Danielle,</a> do you want to give, I know that you haven't had a chance, but is there anything that's specific that's standing out from the city right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5608.659s">Because</a> I just want to make sure we get that clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5914.705s">That's</a> all I have, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5917.748s">Does</a> any member of the board have questions at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5923.212s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Edelman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6026.333s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6026.834s">Ari</a> Fishman?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6130.191s">And</a> I just wanted to echo Vice Chair Hederman's questioning on the pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6135.092s">I</a> did see the link with the trees there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6138.273s">That</a> was one of the questions that I actually <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6145.027s">So</a> to my delight, that has been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6147.47s">So</a> that would have been my only other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6151.314s">Seeing</a> no more questions from the board, I am going to open it up for public comment at this time, since it is a public hearing, and I'll read the public notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6164.657s">The</a> Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on March 20th, 2024 after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6169.96s">via</a> Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review for a new non-residential structure of more than 10,000 square feet, making it a major project and submitted by Empire Management Corporation of 171 Great Road, active mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6186.891s">I</a> don't believe we need to read the second part of the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6195.868s">since</a> we've already read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6196.99s">So</a> now I will open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6198.793s">My</a> apologies to <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6202.322s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6206.865s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6211.547s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6215.21s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6222.774s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6230.534s">questions.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6230.754s">Daniel.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6230.934s">Can</a> you please manage the public comment queue and read any comments that have come in prior to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6236.697s">But</a> the letters or emails.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7612.423s">No,</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7613.864s">I</a> do have a follow-up question though. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7616.325s">Can</a> you go back to the actual fence? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7617.966s">You</a> said that there's no cars left overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7621.608s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7625.71s">But</a> how is the work shielded from the right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7628.132s">I</a> know it's an industrial area, but to kind of clean up the property, how to keep it neat in that area, how are the cars shielded from outside view?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7773.317s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7774.157s">My</a> biggest concern was that it was a surface parking lot, but I didn't hear what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7780.739s">The</a> surface parking lot was just overhead and I wasn't sure how the cars were going to be kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7788.141s">And</a> you've already clarified that they were not kept overnight and that they would be inside of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7793.963s">So</a> I was just trying to figure out exactly what that looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7800.037s">that</a> I appreciate the follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7801.879s">I'm</a> going to actually open it up to the board for further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7813.329s">Vice</a> Chair Hedeman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8224.486s">have</a> another meeting or is this kind of do we get all our questions out tonight other than obviously public comment if we have to open it up again to public comment we're going to do public comment this evening and if there's any public comment that comes in it would be susceptible to open it up again um based on that technicality so we're literally just getting everything out tonight including um the fact that we open up the public hearing we'll give you conditions um if and see how the board wants to vote and <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8253.069s">Again,</a> you're just showing up at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8255.791s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8263.678s">Vice</a> chair.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8291.658s">There</a> was some feedback on, I know you were amenable to putting up some signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8296.201s">You</a> spoke about signs and then the condition of the barbed wire that the city did not particularly care for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8306.147s">Are</a> you amenable to that, Mrs. Nucci?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8313.037s">And</a> then when, of course the city has, if you, when you apply for the sign permit, you have to submit the plans to the planning staff for that going forward, but we'll spell that condition out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8324.105s">We'll</a> have the city spell that condition out before the board makes a decision.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8340.205s">I</a> would like to skip steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8344.788s">And</a> I, we appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8346.229s">And</a> again, that's why we're even, um, making sure that we're dotting our I's and crossing our T's for tonight's technicality. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8352.714s">Um,</a> tiny little inconvenience, but, um, it'll be sealed for later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8359.078s">I'm</a> going to open up the public comment now, uh, period, just in case there's anyone that wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8365.43s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8369.554s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8373.697s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8376.88s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8384.186s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8391.738s">Daniel,</a> can you please check the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters regarding this item?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8407.451s">Hi.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8448.823s">We</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8449.724s">Can</a> you just, can you say your name again and give us the address of Titan?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8460.754s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8461.915s">We</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8488.024s">Okay,</a> so I'm gonna close the public comment period for the meeting for this item and go back to the board for deliberation and discuss the approval for a special permit and if there's any potential conditions for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8505.663s">And</a> we can have Danielle spell those conditions out, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8510.705s">Just</a> to give you an idea of where I sit myself, and then the board can actually all speak, is I actually wanted to make sure that there were no adverse effects, there was no benefits as opposed to adverse effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8523.67s">I</a> will be absolutely transparent with you and let you know that I'm not entirely sure that it's the highest and best use, but there are definitely benefits to <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8533.165s">the</a> use at this point, especially with your property being vacant for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8543.391s">So</a> I think that there's no negative benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8546.913s">If</a> anything, it'll be all positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8548.794s">And</a> saying that, I will actually be more in favor of this project going forward at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8555.257s">So</a> I will turn it over to see if the board has anything else to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8567.654s">Vice</a> Chair Hederman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8585.33s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8586.151s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8586.672s">Which</a> is based on a technicality, so pretty much we'll get our tentative approval this evening with conditions, and they will come back to have us vote officially on a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8602.106s">Are</a> we got that, Average Fishman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8637.99s">So</a> we do have a couple of conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8639.572s">Danielle,</a> do you want to summarize those for us?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8715.702s">And</a> just Vice Chair Hedeman had mentioned striped parking for the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8722.065s">Vice</a> Chair Hedeman, do you want to speak or?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8800.022s">Yeah,</a> I would that would be very helpful, especially with the direction of the city's comprehensive plan for the use of the South that South method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8809.147s">It</a> would it would give us a little more idea of what better fits there if. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8816.131s">That</a> use is not compatible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8821.173s">Mr</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8848.713s">Because</a> it's still a special permit, you're being, you're a least <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8854.592s">Your</a> use is considered a leased use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8857.293s">So</a> before that lease can be renewed, you would have to come back before our board for another special permit before the landlord can actually just allow you another lease just to make sure that it's complying again with the city's use for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8878.584s">We</a> have a comprehensive plan, a vision for that area and <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8883.873s">As</a> of right now, although it's industrial, it's not by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8889.037s">So</a> we're giving you a special permit because it goes against the uses that the city has moved forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8894.741s">So</a> in order to continuously allow a use that's not compatible with the area, we need to make sure that there is more benefits than adverse effects, if that makes sense.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8912.298s">Alicia,</a> did you want to add to that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9033.292s">Yeah,</a> just we're trying to provide the city with some safeguards on how, like if there were adverse effects that outweigh the benefits going forward, how do we revisit that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9043.674s">And</a> I'm not, again, in lieu of having a city solicitor here, I'm not sure how to move forward with that condition either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9053.116s">So</a> I'm not, I guess we wouldn't condition it this evening if the city's not comfortable with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9059.458s">We</a> can have these answers in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9063.68s">Okay,</a> yeah, so we'll take we'll table that for now, but keep it in if the city can actually report back on that that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9073.466s">Vice</a> chair Edelman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9113.464s">absolutely</a> clear that it was given the city a safeguard, but at the same time, I'm more invested in the comprehensive plan for the use of that area, especially having been on the comprehensive board steering committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9128.673s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9148.284s">Yeah,</a> no, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9153.687s">We</a> definitely will. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9155.147s">I</a> wanted to just make sure that I got everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9157.409s">And</a> then I have Mr. Bean, you have something to add?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9261.861s">So</a> to reiterate what Daniel has already said, as of right now, the reason why you need a special permit is an auto glass shop is not the highest and best use for that area as per our comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9278.036s">However,</a> because we found that there's more benefits than adverse effects as of today's date, the board has decided to allow it to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9288.304s">But</a> we are trying to figure out in five years, will that continue to be the case? <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9294.807s">So</a> the best way to explain this is it's not the city's vision for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9300.829s">And</a> I'm not sure that they would want to continuously allow that use in that area, especially after putting so much time and energy into zoning recodification and zoning amendments.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9347.141s">No,</a> and so just to, I want to make sure because now you have the tenant that's, and I understand, I would be the same way that you would continue to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9362.651s">And</a> so if this is something that does not need to be on the table, we can take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9367.305s">if</a> it's not even something within our purview.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9429.804s">Vice</a> Chair Hetherman?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3976.948s">Thank</a> you for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3978.01s">I</a> just want to clarify my inquiry was that I understand that the no build scenario, but however, it's like, it's you create. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3989.502s">no</a> matter how many new cars you add to that intersection, it's still creating, it's adding to the instability of that breakneck point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3999.125s">And</a> it's like, just like if you were on, I don't know, intersection 495, whether you build something new, intersection 495 is going to always be unstable at a loss of F. And I just want to know what were the other scenarios that you would do to create mitigation for that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4045.036s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4046.397s">Peter?</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4965.812s">Thank</a> you very much, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4966.973s">And</a> again, thank you, Attorney Borowsky and Mr. Quinn for following up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4973.224s">I</a> do see one other comment from Jack's iPad. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4978.527s">Alicia,</a> can you please unmute and for the commenter, can you please identify yourself, state your name and your address?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5036.826s">Yes,</a> you can actually, yes, Mr. Quinn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5120.351s">Yes,</a> I can read it now, but we're actually closing the public comments to go through all of the conditions and the department head comments, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5131.261s">I'll</a> highlight this one for the commenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5135.724s">Pre-demolition</a> and pre-construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5139.308s">They</a> in our requirement for permit sign off from the board of health, ongoing reports from a licensed pet control company will be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5145.529s">That</a> will be a condition upon approval if approval is made to the city council.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5167.273s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5168.863s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5193.619s">Is</a> there, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5195.261s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5196.482s">You</a> can stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5197.703s">I'm</a> not sure if we're going to keep the sharing going for now or.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5209.291s">Yes,</a> if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5210.993s">Actually,</a> I couldn't see anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5215.316s">I</a> just wanted to make sure before I close the comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5218.759s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5224.87s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5225.33s">All</a> right, so I'm going to close the comment period now and I'm going to bring it back to the board to see if there's any clarifying, again, any clarifying comments that you are looking for or want to deliberate on now, especially to discuss the criteria for approval under site plan review and the PD special permit and potential conditions for approval actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5252.587s">Alicia.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5446.292s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5447.352s">So</a> before we can even go into this, we have to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5455.714s">The</a> site plan is actually in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5459.856s">With</a> the method zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board shall approve a site plan if the board finds that the site plan is consistent with the performance standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5467.332s">for</a> multiple dwellings or non-residential use described in section 6.4, and that the proposed development meets the standards listed in section 11.710. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5478.198s">I</a> will not read out all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5479.839s">However,</a> that's where we're pulling from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5481.62s">So</a> again, the standards for site plan review listed in section 11.7.10 of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5488.363s">And</a> we're also looking for the criteria for approval for a special permit granting authority may approve the PDU special permit if the SPGA finds that all the following, that there are, I believe there are nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5503.978s">And</a> Alicia, usually Danielle will put these on the screen for the public to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5507.862s">There</a> are nine criteria that need to be met for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5512.451s">And</a> I'm not sure if you want to share those for the public or if we can just go over the conditions that need to be discussed and hashed out per the department heads prior to us even getting to that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5533.164s">So</a> again, there's seven criteria under the site plan, and then there's about nine under the special permit granting agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5540.425s">And</a> our due diligence would be to make sure that we, that the proponent in the project is covering all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5551.927s">And</a> based on city department head comments, if we were to approve this, there are conditions that would need to be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5561.726s">specifically</a> speaking, 41 conditions in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5566.969s">And</a> the city at this point will highlight those conditions for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5573.572s">Or</a> Alicia, would you like me to highlight them?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5816.67s">If</a> you can specifically touch on the water, because that was one of, I had a question, but there's a condition that captures.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5852.342s">And</a> then the city's coals drainage system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5855.142s">Applicant</a> shall update the plans to show the overflow pipes and connections, if any, to the city's coals drainage system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5860.363s">That's</a> number 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5861.024s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5868.556s">And</a> that will be a condition to get the stormwater permit, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6094.528s">And</a> that would be a question, Attorney Baranski, for the proponent of Mr. Quinn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6203.368s">Thank</a> you, Tony Boranski. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6205.009s">Ari,</a> did you have a further question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6469.745s">And</a> looking over the conditions, what is the board's temperature on even grant and approval tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6475.009s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6475.789s">I'm</a> not sure that we're able to get, are we going to continue this or is this something that you feel comfortable <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6485.916s">with</a> approving or suggesting, recommending for approval to the city council with so many things that are left open?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6651.973s">Peter,</a> thank you for asking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6720.663s">So</a> hearing the city's stance on where they stand with these conditions, as well as the board, at least one board member, and the proponent being amenable to <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6734.795s">adhering</a> to these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6737.778s">I'm</a> looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review for 96 to 104 Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6750.232s">However,</a> before we go there, is the board open to add a condition just for the city to explore more on the noise ordinance issue or the noise nuisance issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6763.018s">Is</a> that something that we can even condition at this point without having determined what that would be? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6776.263s">Don't</a> everybody answer at once?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6841.996s">Thank</a> you, Vice Chair Hedeman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6911.701s">And</a> did we draft, I did not do any notation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6914.401s">Did</a> we draft the actual approval language, the suggested approval language to city council for the noise nuisance?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6975.982s">Thank</a> you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6978.805s">I</a> was negligent in grabbing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6980.426s">Usually</a> I have an open document with the city and I will turn back and see that it's already there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7130.343s">Let</a> me just.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7249.743s">So</a> what you're saying is that in exploring and management of <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7254.06s">the</a> mitigation of sound and the city council was to come up with the condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7257.983s">And</a> therefore the applicant decided that they just wanted to totally remove the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7262.888s">That</a> could actually trigger a trip back to us for site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7268.312s">And</a> you want to stop that ahead of time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7297.074s">But</a> it's not a major project. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7299.296s">What</a> determines it to be a major project? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7302.318s">No,</a> this is a major project because it's 29 units.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7371.281s">Attorney</a> Barofsky, what is your take on this?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7465.908s">Try</a> that language one more time, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7467.549s">A</a> modification or removal of the roof deck will not require a return trip to the Community Development Board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7519.609s">Oh.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7570.418s">Okay,</a> I'm just wordsmithing some language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7603.359s">So</a> for the record, Alicia, I've sent you the language.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7777.455s">I'm</a> just at this point, not sure how much we can condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7783.779s">Sort</a> of like a condition that we're not even, I just want to make sure that we make it as easy and transparent for the proponent going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7794.727s">We</a> don't want to add any undue hardship on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7805.025s">But</a> at the same time, I want to make sure that we capture it clear here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7809.454s">And</a> that's why I'm looking for direction from the city on how to move forward with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7968.399s">All</a> right, so I have a couple of, I have language to read, and I want to make sure that I grab that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7981.647s">Alicia,</a> have you written that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7984.038s">Can</a> you share that with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7985.799s">We've</a> been along.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8014.846s">Vice</a> Chair Hederman has, just before I read them out, she'll be right back. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8030.78s">As</a> soon as we get her back, I will read them out and then we can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8036.625s">Back.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8037.766s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8042.317s">Okay,</a> so this is in reference to 96 to 100 Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8049.799s">I</a> am looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8057.9s">We</a> are also recommending that the city council explore condition with applicant that includes a requirement for management and mitigation of sound on the roof deck as part of their permanent management document. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8070.478s">Any</a> modification or removal which does not expand the roof deck will not be considered a significant site change and may be approved administratively by the Director of Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8083.801s">That's</a> the motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8089.122s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8091.683s">I'll</a> second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8095.124s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Henneman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8098.365s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8100.918s">Ari</a> Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8103.079s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8103.199s">Pam</a> Mariansky. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8105.601s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8106.701s">Myself,</a> Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8108.022s">I'm</a> an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8110.024s">Thank</a> you so much, Attorney Baransky, Mr. Quinn, and the rest of your team.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8118.989s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8120.05s">Have</a> a great evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8152.714s">The</a> board's saying yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8155.395s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8157.845s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8515.958s">Hi,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8516.959s">I</a> had actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8521.977s">Thank</a> you, I was on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8522.959s">I</a> had started reading the agenda item and didn't realize I was on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8528.43s">So</a> the next item on our agenda is 290 Salem Street, a special permit and <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8535.73s">This</a> is for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8539.492s">The</a> Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on February 21st, 2024 after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8546.016s">via</a> Zoom relative to an application by 290 Salem Street, LLC for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review to permit the construction of a three-story mixed-use building that would contain seven residential units and two ground floor commercial units. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8562.787s">at</a> the site known as 290 Salem Street, comprised of properties located at 290 Salem Street and 209 Park Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8572.844s">So</a> I believe the staff has some introductory comments on this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8700.433s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8701.013s">So</a> just to be clear, we are listening, we are opening up the hearing this evening, but we would not be considering a criteria for approval this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8712.122s">We</a> will be providing feedback to the proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8715.765s">And</a> with that, I'm gonna ask the applicant to introduce themselves and to present a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8723.071s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8723.932s">Yes,</a> I'm Terry Vonosky. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8730.978s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8981.555s">Katya</a> has entered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8984.557s">Katya?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8986.758s">Yes,</a> she's here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9708.061s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9708.662s">I</a> should have actually had you keep up the engineering documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9714.043s">One</a> of the things of note were the dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9719.184s">Can</a> you explain how you could access those two rectangular dumpsters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9747.73s">So</a> help me understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9750.092s">So</a> I can see how you can get the one next to the car out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9753.014s">How</a> do you get the one behind that out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9852.619s">We</a> don't have the city engineer here to say whether or not that that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9856.15s">You</a> said that you had received his. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9860.419s">actual</a> comments, is that something that he referenced?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9886.207s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9892.003s">No,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9892.544s">Alicia,</a> did you have any questions regarding this?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9938.592s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9939.592s">And</a> so going back to the design, if you can go back to the design, actually, and one of the things that was mentioned is that you wanted it to fit into the context of the lot, like the corner of the way that the, not the, <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9958.619s">I'm</a> sorry, this was the actual design of the building on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9962.023s">That's</a> what I'm looking for now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9966.367s">Back</a> to, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9980.455s">Right</a> there on the corner, it was mentioned how we wanted it to fit into the context of the lot and then play off the buildings across, but how does it fit into the context of everything else that's there? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9992.506s">Can</a> we have some site plans to show how it would actually fit into that context, like something from the back, the top, the side? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10036.689s">And</a> if you don't have them now, it can definitely be for the next time you before the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10108.186s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10110.666s">Vice</a> Chair Heidemann, you have a question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10260.105s">And</a> do you have any actual shadow studies, especially with it being on the corner like that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10272.073s">That</a> would be something for consideration, just to let you know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10277.236s">And</a> one of the comments, actually, that came up with, if you can clarify it, 30% of the usable open space, that was calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10287.392s">it</a> would help if you have a plan that actually clearly shows that open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10296.92s">And</a> this goes back to engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10300.564s">But</a> before you go, sorry, not to go back and forth, but on this one, on the ground floor, actually, sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10316.16s">How</a> did you calculate the open space? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10319.781s">If</a> you can clearly show that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10333.424s">And</a> then there were some traffic comments actually, the parking lot allows for at least one, the parking lot should strongly consider <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10345.942s">allowing</a> for parking space associated with commercial uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10355.825s">And</a> that's just to enhance the area.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10394.273s">One</a> of the things that the city is concerned about is that residential parking always takes precedence over the commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10400.858s">And</a> then the commercial will have to come back and get like a parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10404.781s">So</a> it's strongly recommended that the board requires a parking space for commercial at this point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10414.749s">One</a> per unit, allowing for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10418.853s">Alicia,</a> can you clarify the city's preference for parking there?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10687.056s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10700.07s">And</a> to reiterate Director Hunt's comment, this is a huge opportunity to pretty much live in that ground space for the pedestrian experience at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10712.202s">Keep</a> that in mind, especially with how it's situated.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10829.38s">Thank</a> you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10830.241s">Does</a> any of the board members have questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10834.744s">Or</a> any input at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10840.167s">Anything</a> to add?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10856.815s">It</a> would have to be a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10858.276s">We're</a> not able to approve anything prior to ZBA's actions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10881.485s">And</a> if ZBA, and I don't want to speak anything into existence or anything like that, but say, for instance, ZBA denies their variance, they're back at square one for a design. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10891.569s">So</a> there's not much we can say or review tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11043.981s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11044.682s">And</a> just keep in mind that we understand that the ZBA needs some kind of design and that it's just a schematic at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11050.947s">So</a> you want to keep in mind how much more of a percentage of design are you going to get to before you bring it before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11058.574s">Because</a> we're giving you this information that we're going to be looking for when you come back.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11090.423s">Alicia,</a> what's the timeline for this?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11201.368s">Any</a> other questions from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11208.351s">Well,</a> because we've legally opened a public hearing, we can also do the public comments and that does not mean that we can't open the public comments again at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11218.975s">So</a> I will open them for now if there's members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11224.727s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Alicia in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11230.031s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11234.515s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11237.937s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11245.123s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11253.063s">Depending</a> on the number, we will limit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11255.504s">As</a> of right now, I don't see any hands, so I will say it was about three minutes per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11262.545s">Are</a> there any members from the public present that want to... Alicia, have you received any comments, previous comments or emails or letters on this item?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11364.031s">What</a> is the exact number of letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11412.015s">Okay,</a> we'll take that into record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11415.036s">I'm</a> going to close the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11417.576s">Just</a> keep in mind that we will reopen when there's additional materials to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11424.617s">So</a> again, the board's not going to consider criteria for approval on the site plan review and special permit this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11431.358s">We're</a> going to allow the zoning board to review the variances before completing that process, all those two processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11443.358s">I</a> would not, at this point, I'm not sure if we should deliberate on anything until the proponent is before us, but I'm open to hear what the rest of the board is saying or thinking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11473.735s">That's</a> my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11475.435s">Vice</a> Chair Hederman.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11481.977s">I</a> just wanted to get the temperature from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11483.577s">Normally</a> we would still deliberate because we open up the public hearing, but I didn't think it was necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11490.639s">Allow</a> the proponent to go before the ZBA and then come back before us and then we can save everyone's time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11499.293s">So</a> I will look for a motion to continue the actual address, 290 Salem Street, special permit and site plan review to March 6th, 2024.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11522.06s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11526.801s">Vice</a> Chair Edelman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11528.742s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11529.695s">Peter</a> Coutts.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11550.17s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11551.271s">Have</a> a great evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11563.442s">I'm</a> not sure that I saw minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11565.984s">The</a> next item are minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11572.189s">No,</a> the draft minutes are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11575.272s">No,</a> there were no minutes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11582.852s">That's</a> totally okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11585.153s">I</a> know that I didn't, I thought I was remiss in seeing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11589.194s">And</a> the next item is miscellaneous or anything like that, that the city or the board want to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11601.739s">Hearing</a> none, the next item is a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11607.281s">So</a> moved.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4296.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4296.818s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4300.056s">And</a> at this point, I do know that there was some feedback from the department heads, and I'm not sure if you've all had a chance to read those. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4307.64s">And</a> so instead of going through them as the conditions, I'm going to open up to the board to see if the board has any clarifying questions prior to me opening up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4318.124s">Does</a> anyone from the board have questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4324.667s">And</a> I can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4326.419s">And</a> if I can please ask, just so that we can see everyone, whoever is sharing the screen, if you can please stop sharing at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4339.986s">If</a> there's any members of the board that have questions prior to opening it up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4346.049s">Any</a> clarifying questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4347.489s">Okay,</a> seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4354.932s">This</a> is a public hearing, so I will now open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4361.021s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4365.928s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4370.891s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4374.254s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it's not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4381.861s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself or staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4390.188s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters in the order in which you choose?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4633.072s">Sorry,</a> I don't mean to cut you off, but I wanna make sure that everyone is limited and able to get through with their comment.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4645.96s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4798.594s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Krause.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4872.14s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Pugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4882.197s">I</a> don't see any other hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4883.818s">Daniel,</a> do you have public comments to read?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4987.981s">Okay,</a> seeing none, I'm going to close the public comments portion and ask the board again if there's any other information that they want to have clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5002.327s">before</a> deliberation?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5027.726s">Thank</a> you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5028.407s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5031.119s">I've</a> been remiss on the actual public comments, but I'm hoping that from your end, you can share that information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5098.263s">What</a> is the legality of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5099.467s">Do</a> you have to acknowledge it or read the entire?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5228.226s">This</a> is not to negate any kind of concerns or anything, but as far as not having enough space for a fire truck, I am sure at this point the fire chief would have <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5239.234s">address</a> that at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5240.835s">So</a> I would look to the city to make sure that that was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5245.859s">And</a> then the traffic engineer for the traffic study has accepted the traffic study with conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5253.184s">As</a> far as the height, the whole idea of it being a zoning amendment was to accommodate the project for a path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5262.11s">So</a> I'm not sure how to address the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5267.457s">going</a> forward if they've been sufficiently covered.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5275.301s">You</a> don't need to respond to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5276.562s">I</a> just, I don't want the public to think that we're not taking their concerns into question, but I'm just trying to highlight that these are things that have been fully vetted and addressed by city officials and Method House and in their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5291.03s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5386.728s">At</a> this point, I would, if Medford Housing or any of its representatives would like to touch upon any of the concerns that have been placed before them, they're more than welcome to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5397.64s">I</a> personally don't <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5399.784s">find</a> it necessary because it has been presented in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5403.328s">And</a> then following up with the conditions, I think that will cover most of the other concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5409.895s">But</a> I'm going to leave that up to my fellow.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5592.808s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5602.472s">So</a> again, at this time, I am going to open up to the board again for clarifying comments and deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5612.547s">Ari,</a> I had seen your hand raised first. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5618.292s">Do</a> you want to go ahead and speak, Ari?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5771.626s">Yes,</a> thank you, Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5774.938s">I</a> was actually, my question was when I heard that there was not going to be a proposal in traffic mitigation, that's what I want to go back and want to know what the proponent had, if you had had a chance to read the department head comments, or if that was something that we were going to collectively do at the end with conditions, if there was approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5793.995s">But</a> there are a significant amount of conditions that we'll have to go over prior to us being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5801.801s">approved</a> site plan or recommend to the city council for a special permit at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5807.064s">And</a> hearing no other comments from the board, I do know, and based on my review and based on confirmation from the city, the plans have not changed based on what was adopted and recommended by the CDB board, by the city council previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5826.814s">So</a> at this point, if we did want to approve, I'm guessing <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5832.611s">we</a> would be looking at the conditions as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5836.933s">And</a> if Danielle, I know that in lieu of saying comply with this person's memo dated X or that person's memo, if you can neatly collect them and pretty much go down the line for us so we're all on the same page and understand what those conditions are before the proponent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5885.609s">Yes,</a> that would be helpful.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6403.787s">Mr.</a> Driscoll?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6546.233s">Meaning</a> if we were to decide on it as part of the site plan review?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6726.52s">I</a> can see that as protecting the natural resources at this point, but I'm just not seeing how it would be incorporated into the site plan review, but maybe definitely the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6738.647s">As</a> a recommendation, I would like to know the temperature of the rest of the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6772.324s">Thank</a> you, Sally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6773.285s">Anyone</a> else?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6819.325s">And</a> as far as the board approving this evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6824.142s">There's</a> no pressure, because we have the purview to continue till a date certain if there's a lot of information here that you need to digest, especially with hearing new information that has not been shared with the entire PDS staff as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6837.907s">But</a> if we feel comfortable, which I can only speak for myself, feel comfortable with knowing that the proponent will work with the department heads and the city, and as long as the proponent is amenable <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6851.057s">to</a> these conditions, that these are not something that they're not amenable to, or what was going to cause an issue or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6858.939s">But</a> as long as you're willing to work together going forward, I'm okay with the approvals tonight, but I don't know how the board is failing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6897.007s">Thank</a> you very much, Attorney Kilson.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6971.542s">Yes,</a> so at this point, what I'm looking for is a motion to approve with conditions as set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6978.905s">Site</a> plan review for one in three to 20 walk-in court from Merford Housing Authority, and that excludes miscellaneous conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6988.21s">I'm</a> not even sure if that's proper language, but approve with conditions minus the miscellaneous condition for site plan approval.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7004.771s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7006.992s">And</a> before we actually do the motion, does that even capture the approval properly?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7025.677s">Yes,</a> and according to the zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board has approved, has found approval that is consistent with the performance standards as described in section 6.4 of section 11.7.10. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7044.567s">Does</a> that need to be stated for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7050.705s">It</a> also meets the proposed development standards as listed in section 11.7.10. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7055.327s">You</a> think that captures it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7071.653s">State</a> it out again, and we'll do it one more time, a motion to approve both conditions minus the miscellaneous condition as set forth for the site plan review for one and three to 20 Walkland Court for Medford House with Dawn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7100.121s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7101.806s">Ari</a> Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7104.508s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7105.489s">Sally</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7107.21s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7109.572s">Pam</a> Mariabansky. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7111.153s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7112.614s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7114.155s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7116.417s">And</a> now I'm looking for a motion to recommend as a referral board to the city council for plan development district special permit, micro housing authorities one and three to 20 walk on court along with <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7132.267s">the</a> miscellaneous condition that the applicant shall contribute $50,000 to the city for the dedicated purpose of purchasing and installing public trees throughout the city.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7228.598s">Okay,</a> so for the board's order of business, the next is approval of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7251.476s">A</a> motion to approve, let's see what the minutes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7255.259s">What</a> date?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7260.539s">Can</a> we do them collectively or do they have to be called out individually?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7279.311s">To</a> follow, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7280.312s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7280.572s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7281.859s">a</a> motion to accept the meeting minutes from 12, 2023.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7762.925s">I</a> wanted to put a shameless but very, very beneficial plug out for CPTC, the Citizens Planner Training Collaborative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7770.291s">We're</a> having our annual conference at the Holy Cross on Saturday, March 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7775.476s">I</a> say we because I'm a board member, and it's been a lifesaver for me, especially being a new board member previously and not working at the local, being a planner but not working directly in a local level and knowing how to, <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7788.247s">handle</a> municipal planning and land use and that's pretty much what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7792.991s">It</a> trains up planning boards and municipal planning staff on the use of land, on land use, like the newest trends and part of what the annual conference, what I like about the annual conference as opposed to like just the webinars or the on-demand training <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7809.907s">Is</a> that there's going to be everything there you mentioned emily and she's doing like a site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7813.789s">So</a> again, this is a shameless plug for march 16th It's I think not only for your staff alicia, but for the so but not that you want to give up your saturday like I am um, but It's a wealth of information that um that people can really get into you who's going forward here on the board or In your planning career like if you are a plan I agree i've been i've attended those in the past and um
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7913.023s">Of</a> course there's not, Alan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7916.324s">Only</a> because they were so, it's like, get the information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7922.368s">And</a> it's like you wanted everyone to save the date, but it's like you're going to have to save the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7925.451s">You</a> got to build up this interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7926.592s">You</a> got to go to the thing and we're still trying to figure out where to plug people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7930.736s">We're</a> still trying to get keynote speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7932.457s">Last</a> year, we were able to get the lieutenant governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7934.399s">We</a> jumped on her because, you know, she was coming into office and she's a planner, literally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7940.344s">Well,</a> she's a lawyer, but <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7943.507s">she's</a> she's a planner so and it's one of those things where she loved the opportunity so she came right into it being you know in her role but now we can't even get a keynote so we're trying to figure everything out this year and we said don't put anything on the on the website don't tell anyone about the registration and it looks like they did so i'm telling you word of mouth because i didn't think that there was anything on the website yet <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7967.835s">But</a> just more of a state of the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7970.819s">I</a> mean, but Alicia, if you want, I can pretty much email you what's on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7975.405s">Like</a> I know MBTA communities and 3A and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7979.15s">There's</a> a lot of interest that planners have said over the course of these sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7986.43s">And</a> I pride myself in being a planner, and I have AICP, but at the same time, I lose my skills because I don't use it at the local level the way you guys do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7993.794s">And</a> being in this role right now, it's like I'm always, I feel so intimidated because I'm with these other chairs sitting around Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8001.279s">I'm</a> like, oh, they're going to know so much more than me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8002.999s">And</a> I sat next to someone who was like, are you excited about 3A legislation? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8006.481s">He</a> was like, what's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8007.622s">And</a> I'm like, oh, so I do know more than you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8010.646s">Wait,</a> that's impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8012.768s">So</a> this is hugely needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8014.891s">I</a> want to humble myself and say there's a lot of things I'm still learning, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8018.852s">Boys</a> just need it, boys.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8042.102s">This</a> is different from the webinar. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8043.843s">In</a> our conference now, not only is it in Worcester and Central Massachusetts, but you do get fed, like Daniel said, but it's an all-day event, 8 to 3.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8053.628s">But</a> we've gone up to $100 for the registration now, just to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8059.652s">So</a> when you said it's still pretty much affordable, but it's a little bit more than what people- You know, APA charges like $1,800 for registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8070.095s">And</a> except for the core courses, like the comprehensive planning, zoning, and things like that, you get AICP credits, if you're AICP. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8078.465s">I</a> mean, if anyone cares about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8079.786s">So</a> I just wanted to let everyone know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8081.969s">I</a> don't want to drone on and on about that, but I did want to send that plug out, especially when Alicia mentioned Emily Ennis, because she is there, and some of the other <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8091.786s">people</a> that are hands-on with helping planners, like Julie Barrett, they'll be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8098.789s">My</a> agency is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8100.15s">We</a> can't get the secretary to do economic development plan, but we are going to do a one-stop session like we did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8106.152s">That's</a> AICP credit, too.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8124.131s">And</a> I'm definitely definitely zoning board of appeals and, and planning board officials, pretty much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8148.381s">Yeah,</a> there's this real cool one this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8150.663s">They're</a> doing a Laurel and Hardy go to planning school pretty much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8153.466s">It's</a> going to be a play on how you arrive at that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8156.429s">So</a> that's pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8157.83s">So</a> anyways, again, not to hold you up any longer, but I just wanted to throw that out there because I thought it was pretty awesome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8196.863s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8198.418s">Thank</a> you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8200.359s">Okay,</a> so hearing no other updates, a motion to adjourn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8226.837s">So</a> Ari Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8229.82s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8231.263s">Polly</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8233.408s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8234.431s">Pam</a> Mariansky. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8235.774s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8236.896s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8238.339s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8239.201s">Good</a> night, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8240.224s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8240.825s">Bye,</a> everyone.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_8Di2Vz73jrg/2025-06-26_8Di2Vz73jrg.html">Community Development Board 12-20-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=74.46s">Pam</a> Mariansky. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=75.781s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=77.042s">Sally</a> Akiki.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=84.606s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=87.768s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=88.088s">And</a> Danielle, you can introduce any staff on the call.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=99.415s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=102.742s">And</a> so first meet an agenda, Daniel, can you remind me while I am still fumbling?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=242.892s">So</a> I saw some that were old and it referenced... It's just to answer the open meet and laugh, the temporary provisions have been extended by Governor Haley until March 31st of 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=256.739s">2025,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=257.179s">I</a> was hoping it was 2025.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=319.702s">And</a> this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=320.702s">Composition</a> of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=323.283s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, this has been given to each board member since as, as brought on, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=330.445s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=336.368s">That</a> was the intention, so I'm not sure where that was left at.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=373.529s">Yeah,</a> I definitely think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=376.671s">I</a> can only speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=377.911s">It</a> warrants us to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=379.532s">It's</a> just I didn't know how much we would get through it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=381.712s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=384.903s">One</a> of the things I want to be clear on is that we definitely have to do some adjustments, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=390.346s">And</a> that's even administrative sort of things with the filing of applications and shutting them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=399.309s">We</a> had discussed that previously as a board, just going forward and, like, you don't want to get something on a Friday night and then have to, like, scramble to read it over the weekend for the following week, kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=413.384s">Yeah,</a> so my opinion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=439.482s">Yeah,</a> and just giving the board some time to digest it and see if there's anything that you can recommend or that you want to discuss as a group on what can be changed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=491.387s">Yeah,</a> go ahead, Emily.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=533.863s">So,</a> I mean, I just- Yeah, not so much a motion at this point, but I'm interested in knowing the feedback from other board members, and it just can be, again, how it'll go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=546.986s">Because</a> I'm sure no one, you're not going to be able to take this in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=550.427s">We</a> might go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=552.445s">and</a> be like, oh, we should have said this, we should have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=557.167s">But</a> again, it's like Daniel said, it's more of an open discussion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=588.291s">It</a> is good information, because from my understanding, this would be given to every new board member as part of their onboarding, and it sounds like no one has it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=616.094s">So</a> make sure that all board members have it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=620.356s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=640.368s">Yeah,</a> no, I hear what you're saying, but at the same time, I'm a little, since we have a meeting and we're open, I'm trying to just get more feedback from other board members and not just like, just my hearing myself for.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=668.763s">So</a> that's, that's pretty much my feeling from the beginning, but I just want to make sure that I'm not like tabling it and other people wanting to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=677.967s">And</a> in that case, I guess we can just, if someone wants to give the motion, I guess.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=702.649s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=707.472s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=708.892s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=709.053s">Pam</a> Mariansky? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=711.214s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=712.234s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=712.875s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=715.7s">Wait,</a> she's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=716.921s">Sharad</a> Bhattacharya?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=720.922s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=722.923s">I'm</a> an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=725.944s">And</a> so the next item, Daniel, was fee schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=732.107s">Do</a> you want to lead us in discussion on what you were thinking with the fee schedules?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1054.199s">Yes,</a> Emily.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1148.205s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1150.046s">These</a> are planned board, but it's up to the office of, uh, it's up to Daniel's office to make sure that we're in compliance with, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1158.998s">the</a> amounts that we can charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1161.579s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1162.64s">It</a> sounds like Danielle has done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1167.082s">Like,</a> um, whatever the fees or just, like, just, like, develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1173.145s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, Danielle, it's the same, like, if we were charging developer, like, some kind of fee or something like that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1178.728s">We</a> have to make sure that we're in compliance and that we're not overcharging for certain things, or is this more administrative?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1431.872s">Sorry,</a> Katie. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1434.763s">For</a> myself, going back to something Emily said, I didn't... I guess I mixed this up with, like, developer impact fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1441.127s">You</a> know, that can be... that can violate Fifth Amendment if we don't... because it's regulatory, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1446.15s">We</a> have to make sure that we're within reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1448.652s">And</a> so since this is more like an administrative kind of staff thing, it's just building a case for us to pretty much adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1455.036s">And</a> I guess we just need a little bit more information on... Obviously, we know it's going to impact <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1461.32s">the</a> city somewhat for the deficit, but just give us something to vote on, I think, a little bit more background. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1468.825s">I</a> see you did the research, but I would love to know, like, what we're charging versus another one, another community that's near us or something like that, just to see where we're at in comparison, just so that people have more confidence to vote on what you're presenting, because, again, this should still be, to me, a city staff kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1491.058s">But</a> since it's not.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1498.623s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1499.123s">I</a> don't want to be rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1500.324s">I'm</a> going off camera just to grab my plug. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1502.906s">I'm</a> not going to turn the camera off. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1504.427s">And</a> I'm just going to jump up and grab my plug.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1556.693s">No,</a> no, I just I'm trying to work from two different and I just can't see everyone because it's suppressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1562.315s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1629.092s">Well,</a> for this item itself, just because, I mean, I don't want to be the odd one out, but I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1635.504s">I</a> definitely have an idea of how low our fees are already, but I have more of an advantage based on dealing with other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1644.531s">And</a> so the fact that we are so low, but I don't want that to be a reason why I'm ready to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1650.976s">I</a> would need the entire board to feel confident and vote in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1656.9s">One</a> of my biggest questions to Danielle was just what does that entail to bring you guys to confidence? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1669.963s">I</a> mean, without me even saying that I know other communities and what they charge, the fact that this hasn't been done in 1974, since 1974, that's a reason to up them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1681.209s">But</a> what do we up them to? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1683.21s">Are</a> we going high enough?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1718.117s">And</a> that's exactly where I came to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1721.158s">Are</a> we even going high enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1722.399s">And</a> will we have to revisit this again to go higher? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1724.519s">Will</a> we be doing this a second time?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1947.339s">And</a> again, the linkage fees are the same as impact fees, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1950.923s">That's</a> allowed through special... I will tell you legally, no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2000.795s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2003.347s">1,</a> 2nd, and my question regarding the link histories, because we're tabling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2007.772s">Someone</a> had asked earlier if we can table the link histories and be separate and I wanted to make sure and Alicia had responded saying that you needed a study and everything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2017.003s">So</a> I wanted the board to have a full understanding that that was like a regulatory thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2021.736s">or</a> if it was through legislation or if it's something that we can even discuss going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2026.221s">So</a> I wanted to make sure that that was clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2028.062s">And</a> Alicia has answered that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2031.346s">So</a> again, I guess us voting tonight would be, it would definitely take linkage fees off the table, but what does that look for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2039.354s">What</a> does that look like for us going forward anyways?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2069.607s">Okay,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2078.856s">And</a> going back to Emily's question, um, to move the board forward, what do we need to establish tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2086.521s">Um,</a> are we voting? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2089.343s">Is</a> there, are we in a position to vote or are we tabling this to the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2098.749s">And</a> that's me opening it up to the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2129.024s">Yeah,</a> I'm sorry, I had loosely heard, we didn't put it in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2134.785s">We</a> didn't capture it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2135.606s">But</a> basically, the conversation had bounced back, like, I don't know, give it a date, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2141.067s">And</a> I like Emily's idea of maybe like rolling this out in a month, get given some time, and then, you know, let them know that it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2150.129s">And</a> then maybe look at it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2151.43s">And</a> it'd be more incremental later. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2154.25s">But</a> right now, roll this out, and give them time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2247.8s">Oh,</a> Peter has joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2249.061s">Peter,</a> did you hear enough to even?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2267.437s">But</a> no, don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2269.639s">So</a> it took my husband and I nearly 40 minutes to get from Medford to Medford tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2276.346s">We</a> went to get pizza and avelinos and we couldn't get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2282.647s">I'm</a> exaggerating. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2283.307s">It</a> wasn't 40 minutes, but it was forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2285.348s">We're</a> going to do the word play again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2294.689s">If</a> you could try one more time, Ari, sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2311.758s">I'll</a> second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2315.46s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2317.702s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2318.642s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2663.02s">And</a> this just, I mean, it works for me, but I want to make sure this, is this a date that we're still, because I remember we changed them to accommodate schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2673.744s">Emily,</a> are you still in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2675.504s">Not</a> to put you out, just anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2677.145s">I</a> just want to make sure that this still works for everyone and that you don't need to change it for whatever reason.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2699.702s">We've</a> tried to accommodate members as much as possible going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2703.143s">Like</a> if there was something else that there was a conflict and we wanted to make sure and you would never be able to be there, then obviously we want to look at a date that we get most of our board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2713.889s">And</a> it seemed like Wednesday we fell on where everyone could pretty much be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2718.528s">Now</a> that there's new members, I just want to make sure that that's still the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2721.989s">And</a> I also want to make sure that it's still a good day for the former board members.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2832.012s">That's</a> exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2833.112s">I'm</a> happy that you're fully staffed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2852.545s">Well,</a> for my eldest daughter, it's her birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2855.207s">It's</a> not Christmas, so.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2876.202s">I'm</a> going to do a roll call attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2878.864s">If</a> there's no other updates or anything that anyone wanted to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2882.486s">I</a> will do a roll call for adjournment.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2595.816s">Oop,</a> there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2599.877s">I've</a> not been on this side of the rail too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2602.797s">But</a> this all seems vaguely familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2606.038s">So</a> before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2612.279s">And</a> this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2619.84s">But</a> it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2625.641s">once</a> fellow school committee members and school committee elect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2628.942s">Congratulations</a> to you, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2631.442s">Now,</a> I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2651.626s">So</a> while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2655.933s">To</a> Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2659.558s">And,</a> you know, a couple of words kept on coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2663.603s">One,</a> diligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2665.618s">Oh</a> my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2676.162s">Just</a> amazing dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2678.462s">And</a> of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2691.926s">posts</a> and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2696.128s">So</a> hello to Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2698.15s">I'm</a> sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2704.293s">You</a> really deserve it, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2705.754s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2708.155s">And</a> to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2715.499s">Not</a> blunt, but moral. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2720.911s">I</a> remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2735.276s">with</a> a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2745.106s">And</a> I so appreciated that from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2748.289s">And</a> of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2754.995s">And</a> that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2764.36s">So</a> anyway, congratulations to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2766.601s">I</a> know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2770.743s">And</a> just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2782.248s">So</a> I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2789.354s">Some</a> of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2792.357s">But</a> we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2796.661s">I</a> actually have to go back and figure it out sometime. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2800.905s">The</a> Medford Educational Foundation was started <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2804.835s">way</a> long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2818.442s">It</a> lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2823.905s">Ann</a> Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2835.765s">Today,</a> tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2851.755s">Each</a> year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200 <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2865.385s">or</a> another grant from $200 to $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2869.231s">And</a> we accept those grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2872.055s">And</a> then as a body, we deliberate on the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2876.222s">We</a> check out with the schools that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2879.136s">The</a> projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2888.16s">And</a> Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2902.441s">This</a> December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2917.219s">While</a> we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2931.087s">The</a> December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2947.307s">So</a> tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2956.137s">But</a> we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2961.483s">However,</a> we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2967.409s">we</a> want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2980.275s">And...</a> This is Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2981.256s">Jean,</a> stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2985.218s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2995.492s">This</a> connection between us and Jean was because of Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3001.219s">And</a> so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3006.586s">As</a> you can see, our requests are steadily increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3010.29s">And</a> in fact, it's, you know, we need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3012.653s">We</a> need more money, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3016.212s">So,</a> and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3030.543s">This</a> coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3040.53s">That</a> is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3045.812s">Anyway,</a> I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3053.875s">David</a> Sayers, David <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3056.138s">coordinates</a> all the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3057.919s">In</a> the second row, Stephen Hayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3060.101s">Stephen</a> Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3063.484s">And</a> by the way, we have been working with Gerry McCue and Noel Velez right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3070.889s">And</a> I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3078.135s">So</a> here's the check and they're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3080.757s">So</a> I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3086.012s">Do</a> we have a motion for approval?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3097.676s">So</a> now I can officially hand it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3101.778s">Steve</a> should really be up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3114.335s">So</a> our treasurer, Steve, is very diligent and tracking all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3120.701s">And,</a> you know, we hope after we closed our time period for receiving the grants, we received several more on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3130.871s">And</a> the other place where we've had donations, apart from private donations, which we also <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3136.013s">solicit</a> and accept happily. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3138.974s">The</a> Medford Community Fund has also been generous to us, and I want to acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3144.196s">So</a> again, it's great to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3146.157s">Have</a> a great night, and thank you so much.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_o3BXgn2s6XE/2025-06-26_o3BXgn2s6XE.html">Community Development Board 12-06-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=114.41s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=114.83s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=117.875s">This</a> is a continued public hearing to consider and vote on our recommendations to city council regarding the zoning overlay to comply with the MBTA community zoning law. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=126.905s">At</a> the last meeting, the board members were supportive of the proposed overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=130.709s">However,</a> there was discussion regarding the appropriate parking minimums and maximums, such as reducing parking minimums to 0.5 spaces per unit or requiring no parking minimums at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=140.792s">We</a> asked staff to model the unit capacity yields for the 0.5 spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=145.856s">So</a> the city has reported back. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=148.438s">Danielle,</a> if you want to highlight that, and if the board wants to start deliberations from there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=458.686s">I</a> have the, is it the Downtown Trout Work Zoning Study? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=461.907s">Is</a> that the slides that Daniel shared?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=616.486s">Emily,</a> do you have a question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=689.0s">Yeah,</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=691.375s">I</a> echo Emily, 1 of the things that I stand firm with, and I understand that the city has, you know, you take away park and even with transit oriented development, then you'll still see a spillover. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=701.424s">But</a> at the same time, it's like the whole idea of it being compliant and dealing with the transit oriented is that we're trying to prioritize people. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=709.511s">over</a> cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=710.331s">So</a> I am all for the more housing units that we can get on a property, whether they're built or not, but removing that barrier and offering that incentive for a developer to take up if they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=724.637s">So</a> that's where my stance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=725.998s">So</a> I don't know if there's any other questions that's leading up to us and what we need to do for recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=732.1s">And</a> as far as maximum parking, I would say we definitely want to <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=738.885s">I'm</a> all for bringing it down under the 1.5 maximum if needed, but I don't know how the board feels about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=746.949s">This</a> is just picking up on what we were talking about at the previous meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=749.811s">I</a> don't know if anyone had any comments on the maximum parking or if there's any other comments on the parking overall.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=832.94s">And</a> also still definitely keeping in mind equity for people that actually really need to utilize those spaces, whether it's a disability or they're caring for someone or whatever the reason is, we're still allowing it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=845.71s">It's</a> not going into zero, but so we're making notice that, yeah, parking is needed, but again, minimal parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=864.877s">All</a> right, so, Danielle, I know that you wanted us to sort of give some feedback on developer incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=872.479s">Did</a> anyone have any further discussion on how you thought the incentives played out in the amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=884.822s">Or</a> any additional thoughts from what was captured at the last meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=904.655s">Or</a> if you wanted to add anything to Daniel's suggested or not suggested, but they're captured development incentive bonuses, or are you fine with how they are as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=924.945s">Is</a> the board ready to vote on a recommendation for the. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=930.572s">Is</a> it, it's the approval of the amendment for the zoning overlay to send to City Council or to recommend to City Council?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1005.328s">No,</a> thank you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1006.808s">That's</a> my oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1007.789s">I</a> actually, this is a continuation of a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1010.83s">So</a> I absolutely do, before we go on with the vote, I want to open up to the public, whether there's members representing the public or not, just to give them the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1022.973s">So</a> at this point, I will open up the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1026.354s">So</a> those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1031.657s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1035.839s">Individuals</a> may have up to three minutes to provide comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1038.661s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1043.524s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1050.648s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and C-staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1059.275s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1062.257s">And</a> once that's done, if you, Alicia or Danielle, if you have anything that you want to read, emails or letters, or even if you want to, I know that we had one at the previous meeting, if you want to read that out again, I'm not sure if it's necessary.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1199.221s">Okay,</a> with that said, <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1207.292s">close</a> the public comment period and come back to the board and sort of try to piece this all together and decide which scenario we are going to recommend to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1217.374s">If</a> we're going to all recommend to city council, are we going to do 0.5 and drop a story, which is four stories or keep 0.85 stories for minimum parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1231.336s">So</a> we will have to decide on one of those scenarios. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1234.317s">What</a> was presented was the original <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1237.865s">0.5</a> with four stories, or are we going to 0.8? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1244.63s">Originally,</a> it was 0.8 with five stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1246.872s">Are</a> we going to go to 0.5 and drop a story, four stories? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1252.857s">No,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1281.966s">So</a> because the zoning amendment has been presented for us, this is where we can actually change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1288.45s">So</a> we would be voting collectively at the end for whatever we decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1293.308s">care</a> for whatever we rectify here. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1296.769s">Is</a> that correct, Danielle? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1298.089s">We</a> don't have to do a motion for which we're choosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1301.31s">We</a> just have to actually do a motion for whatever the recommendation is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1329.953s">Or</a> we can recommend to keep it active.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1421.152s">Number</a> seven.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1512.565s">The</a> actual recommendation of city council is not just to approve, but also to adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1517.968s">That's</a> two different motions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.27s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.49s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.751s">That's</a> the motion I would be looking for from the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1596.964s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1600.166s">So</a> to clarify, Robin's rules are she would have had to have watched it previous to tonight's meeting and had signed off saying that she watched it and then she can continue tonight and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1614.685s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1694.743s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1695.104s">So</a> at this point, we would need a motion to recommend to City Council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1707.878s">As</a> amended, for the parking spaces, are we doing 0.8 or 0.5? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1712.22s">I</a> guess that would be more of a discussion for the board to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1718.983s">Peter,</a> what was your <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1732.56s">I</a> guess it's not really a roll call, but if I, if I, I guess, call out, then you can tell me what your voice is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1738.662s">Park</a> and minimums and maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1751.526s">So</a> Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1752.047s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1762.08s">Are</a> you voting to amend it? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1763.86s">We</a> discussed at the last meet, and it was originally 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1768.802s">It</a> was originally 0.8 with five stories, and are we amending it? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1773.523s">Are</a> we keeping that for minimums, or are we going to 0.5, four stories?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1815.965s">Actually,</a> Sally, also for your maximum, are you at 1.5 or 1.2? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1824.147s">And</a> Peter?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1839.071s">You're</a> not going to vote to recommend that at all?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1848.782s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1855.143s">Pam</a> Marianski?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1868.106s">Okay,</a> and then myself for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1870.827s">Did</a> I? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1872.76s">Me.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1873.06s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry, Ari.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2039.587s">And</a> I think that's where we got into the development incentives and how that played into the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2044.189s">And</a> I'm almost positive, but Sharad can share more of his side of that's where he was a little apprehensive about with the density and so forth.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2126.105s">And</a> I believe the city responded, please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the area outside of that is already planned for, the city has planning goals for like commercial and lab space, not residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2140.014s">So</a> that's pretty much why moving to another part of the city is not really feasible with compliance for one or with the city's planning goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2147.639s">And</a> so as highlighted by Danielle with the previous meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2452.491s">Peter,</a> you have a question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2511.283s">So</a> with that being said, I want to make sure that we're all, I guess, even for myself, I inadvertently assumed that the 0.55 stories was given us more. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2523.37s">I'm</a> not sure how we got that backwards.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2680.705s">And</a> then remind me of the affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2683.526s">If</a> there's affordable units, it has to be set at 0.5, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2835.574s">I'm</a> assuming that that's pretty much where the rest of the board was coming from too, 0.8, because it's not written. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2841.379s">It's</a> just a barrier removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2842.941s">They</a> can do what they can, but then it's more so the maximum that we were really looking to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2849.646s">But</a> we wanted to bring it down to 0.8 to give them the option, even if it's not something that they pick up on. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2854.69s">So</a> 0.8 for minimum, and then perhaps 1.2 for maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2855.971s">I</a> thought that's where I landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2868.178s">And</a> it looks like Ari landed there, as did Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2877.08s">So</a> that's three of us, but we have Sally with 1.5 maximum, and Pam with 1.5 maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2888.603s">And</a> Sherrod, Emily abstaining, and Sherrod, a no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2906.373s">OK,</a> so now we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2907.253s">All</a> right, so I guess, so let me just let me try this. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2928.967s">So</a> are we prepared to vote on a recommendation with the motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington station multifamily overlay district as amended to 0.8, which is five stories for minimum parking and 1.2 for maximum parking and making sure to add the Y <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2954.712s">for</a> non-commercial greenhouse, tool shed, or similar assessment structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2961.056s">Did</a> I get that right, Alicia?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2975.464s">It</a> was originally 0.8.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3048.135s">So</a> for myself, I'm not a transportation planner, but dealing in economic development and some of the things that I know that goes into the traffic engineering and everything that comes with developers and their incentives, I'm willing to keep it at 1.8 to keep it attractive, even though, I mean, I don't know how the board feels about going to 0.5 at this point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3119.384s">And</a> we don't want the city to lose an economic development planner before they get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3132.028s">So</a> I guess am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3134.052s">I'm</a> going to reiterate here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3557.747s">And</a> so that's what I'm just trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3559.008s">And</a> I'm trying to stay out as much as the conversation as possible, because as you know, just what would be in my previous agency, well, now that we're separated, the whole idea of it being an MBTA rule is to eliminate parking minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3574.481s">So</a> I'm trying not to be too heavy handed on my, <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3579.771s">my</a> share and why I think it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3583.093s">I</a> prefer for the boards to deliberate and for us to get to an agreement of what the minimum parking is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3600.303s">No,</a> no, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3601.624s">And</a> I like I said, I just I allow you to go I it this is great for other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3606.045s">And</a> it's even you know, great for the members of the audience, the public and even myself just to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3611.447s">But</a> I already know that I am sort of biased in where I sit, unfortunately.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3683.985s">Yeah,</a> I'm looking more at the maximums than I am at the minimums, but it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3690.37s">So</a> we would be amending to so we were at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3693.853s">We</a> were asking for a vote to recommend just to get a little bit more of the boys temperature again. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3700.418s">So</a> Peter, you're now saying 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3702.78s">And</a> to be clear, can the city clarify what the actual. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3713.14s">parking</a> minimums around other transit areas in Medford?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3774.022s">Yeah,</a> I can go with either the 0.8 or 0.5 for minimums, but I'm definitely, my vote is for the 1.2 for maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3782.688s">So</a> I guess we just have to come back to agreement because as of right now, we only have Ari and Peter that are saying 0.5 for minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3791.774s">So</a> we have to get that clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3825.048s">Yeah,</a> based on what he's already shared with us, I deduce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3832.01s">All</a> right, Ari for minimum?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3899.222s">Sam?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3925.176s">So</a> yeah, I'm the same for me for the minimums, either 0.8 to 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3929.819s">And</a> I definitely hear that, especially myself taking MBTA from where I sit, we're not at a point where Medford can just start dropping parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3941.747s">But</a> at the same time, even though I think I'm less than, I'm a little bit over half a mile, but <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3948.982s">even</a> I can get to Wellington station easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3951.923s">So</a> the fact that this is like right there in the Wellington station area, that's not one of my biggest concerns, and I will stand by my 1.2 for maximum, but I can be swayed for 0.8, 0.5 for minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3967.047s">So</a> looking at that overall, if I was to change to 0.5 to keep it, it would be Peter, myself and Ari, <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3978.635s">have</a> the same numbers as does PAM, so that's four. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3984.296s">That's</a> voting for 0.5 minimum, 1.2 maximum to get it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3995.818s">So</a> in that case, we would be amending because it came in at 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4000.979s">So</a> we're looking for a motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4007.937s">with</a> the amendments for 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4009.678s">It's</a> 0.5 minimum parking and 1.2 maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4020.145s">And</a> then add the Y to the use table.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4034.054s">Is</a> there a second?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4040.355s">I'll</a> do a roll call with. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4045.158s">So</a> I have Peter Cowles.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4048.6s">Ari</a> Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4050.541s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4051.882s">Pam</a> Marionski. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4053.423s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4054.624s">Sally</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4057.186s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4058.444s">Myself,</a> Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes, and we have one no, which is Sharad. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4063.87s">We</a> didn't get your no. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4064.931s">Well,</a> we've heard your no, Sharad, but I should have called you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4070.216s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4072.358s">So</a> we have five yeses for the recommendation to city council.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4093.429s">So</a> I have a motion to recommend to city council that they approved the Wellington station multifamily overlay district with the amendments to from 0.8 spaces from 0.5 spaces per dwelling to 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4107.14s">Well,</a> there's 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4117.591s">From</a> 0.8 to 0.5, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4119.813s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4121.395s">Did</a> you go from 0.5 to 0.8? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4123.517s">We're</a> not keeping it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4124.338s">We're</a> changing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4124.918s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4128.262s">We're</a> amending it from 0.8 to 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4131.125s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4135.649s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4136.47s">And</a> then we're also amending the maximum from 1.5 to 1.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4143.207s">And</a> then we're adding a yes to the use table where it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4146.252s">Do</a> I have to spell that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4148.657s">That's</a> based on my table. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4151.361s">It's</a> number 7 for non-commercial greenhouse to shed or similar accessory structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4175.745s">Is</a> that a sufficient motion or recommendation?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4180.647s">Yes,</a> we have five yeses and one abstention.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4193.453s">Tomorrow,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4196.855s">And</a> we have the next item on the agenda is approval of minutes, but we have none. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4204.312s">So</a> we'll go to the next item, which is miscellaneous and other updates.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4516.045s">And</a> you're looking to get like members of the community as well for the steering committee?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4594.124s">So</a> the role in zoning with the comprehensive plan, I'm trying to see how will this, because zoning is the land use like laws that inform the comprehensive plan that we just did with the steering committee, which I love being on. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4609.747s">So</a> how will that change the comprehensive plan going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4612.128s">Will</a> it, it's going to have a huge.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4623.887s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4627.828s">So</a> you need the zoning changes to actually implement the comprehensive plan as visioned?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4813.78s">I</a> didn't realize we had so many regulatory changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4816.481s">I</a> guess I was so romanticized by the idea of having a collaborative vision of the community that I didn't realize. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4822.945s">And</a> now we have to work backwards to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4825.787s">I</a> mean, I knew we had to, because obviously, being part of it, there were some things that just doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4832.223s">I</a> didn't realize now we got to actually change the rules to match the plan.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4985.902s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4992.753s">Thank</a> you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4995.631s">I</a> think this is one of the longest shortest meetings ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4997.892s">So</a> I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5025.868s">And</a> as long as we don't talk about anything on the agenda that's coming up or has passed, we're good, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5032.493s">So</a> I don't know who would initiate that, like, just send you an email and say, hey, this will be awesome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5055.99s">Well,</a> wait a minute, let's back up for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5058.572s">Robert's</a> Rules, motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5061.114s">It</a> has to be through the chair, Vice Chair Emily Henneman. <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5067.178s">Yes,</a> I am.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1357.094s">I'll</a> stop sharing my screen for the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1361.215s">Daniel,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1363.316s">One</a> of the questions I wanted before you went through is, can you explain to the board and to the public exactly why this district was chosen and how it relates to, like for instance, why not West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1380.92s">Why</a> not Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1382.1s">Why</a> is it at Wellington?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1476.89s">And</a> Alicia, one of the things that I was hoping that can be illustrated here is myself as a planner and knowing more about the law, the MBTA law and how it is, I know, and just speaking with the city that moving it, moving it to another part of it, the city is not feasible with compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1492.186s">But</a> if you can paint out what that looks like for the audience, for the public and for the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1912.721s">So</a> because this is one of the questions that I have, and I think one of the only other questions that I have, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1922.89s">And</a> then I'll open it up for the board for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1926.491s">It's</a> the parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1927.831s">Since</a> we're doing this in a transit oriented development and we have 0.5 at this point, and we can actually really go big and create more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1941.454s">No</a> parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1942.834s">Get</a> rid of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1944.294s">Is</a> that feasible? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1945.575s">Is</a> that something that <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1948.63s">And</a> if I'm not mistaken, Danielle, you've ran the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1953.251s">Can</a> you share with the board what that would mean if we were to get rid of the parking limit?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2129.19s">Yeah,</a> I guess I'm not sure if I'm alone in this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2132.752s">And</a> I understand your reservation on it, but we, our car dependency is the reason why we're in trouble with the house insurance now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2140.256s">So</a> I just saw it as an opportunity just to not to be so car dependent, but I can also understand on the other side, because I happen to live in one of those apartment buildings near Homel that you just referenced.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2263.006s">Is</a> there any other board input on parking minimums or anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2267.048s">Are</a> there thoughts on the actual development incentive bonuses that Danielle wanted input on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2421.404s">Yeah,</a> actually, that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2423.186s">I'm</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2426.193s">against</a> car dependency that one of the things that made it a little bit more humbling was I attended a conference where there was someone with a disability who had kept saying, you know, you keep talking about no parking, no parking, but what about my caretakers that come to take care of me? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2453.96s">All</a> right, so it's currently at 0.5, Danielle, or?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2624.275s">Where</a> I live, if you have, you can have two spaces per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2630.66s">And</a> it's like, I don't know, there's different levels because we have a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2636.004s">It's</a> not part, it becomes part of my rent if I take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2641.228s">If</a> I don't want any, if I want no parking, then it's not part of my rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2645.271s">And</a> I'm guessing that that's what the idea is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2940.371s">No,</a> thank you, Danielle, because one of the things, and it does seem, and we understand where the city's, I understand where the city's situation is, but it's also very, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2952.278s">important</a> and pertinent to let the board know that you're expecting to vote by 12-6-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2958.345s">And</a> if that's the case, then we're going to have to hold another special meeting because who's going to do Thanksgiving?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4012.937s">While</a> you have that up, Alicia, I think I'm going to open it up for public comment in case the public has any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4020.293s">If</a> the board doesn't have any questions at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4026.227s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4031.748s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4035.669s">Individuals</a> may have up to two minutes to provide comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4038.009s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4041.59s">A</a> reminder to all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4048.191s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4055.733s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters that the students received?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4080.458s">There</a> was one, and the resident is present this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4086.043s">I</a> don't know if you wanted to read his comment or have him read it, or I don't know how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4091.988s">William</a> Nabari?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4119.068s">Oh,</a> and congratulations William on your marriage.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4350.97s">Danielle</a> or Alicia, do you want to address either of those questions by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4356.033s">Navarre?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4479.373s">Yes,</a> Mr. Matarazzo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4600.225s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Matarazzo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4912.853s">There's</a> one thing I think I should mention, and only because it's a public hearing and Mr. Matarazzo brought it up as far as leveraging private development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4920.116s">I</a> just want to make a public disclaimer that myself being a senior program manager for the MassWorks Infrastructure Program, I am in no way consulting with the city on leveraging state grants administered by the Executive Office of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4933.662s">Just</a> wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4935.263s">And</a> also, Mr. Matarazzo, congratulations to you and the town of Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4939.524s">Bye.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4949.675s">Do</a> we have any other public comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4961.621s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4962.121s">I'm</a> going to close the public comment section. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4966.94s">And</a> I'm going to come back to the board and see if you want to deliberate or just further discuss the drive zoning ordinance amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4974.666s">I'm</a> not sure that we're prepared to vote or if even the city is asking for a vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4979.45s">So</a> there is a couple of things that they want to get ironed out with Emily Enns, which is Emily Keyes Enns, who is the consultant for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4987.276s">But</a> if there's any other questions that we want to give the city now, or we can email, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4993.669s">But</a> I guess we should get this date certain on the board if that's on the table.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5014.079s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5387.016s">The</a> city of Somerville has parking caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5388.796s">They</a> have parking maximums on their line, on the orange line for Assembly Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5393.037s">I</a> wonder how, but I guess that's more car dependent over there because it's a huge commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5401.819s">I'm</a> just wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5404.72s">Destination.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5405.62s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5406.98s">But</a> even that, with that, they have parking caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5414.362s">Yeah,</a> I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5417.669s">I'm</a> not so much concerned with the maximum, the parking maximum, but if we can decrease it a little bit somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5423.853s">Then</a> I guess I would be interested in knowing what the benefits are if there are any, but if there's not a significant incremental change, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5441.826s">I</a> guess just so that the board is able to vote with confidence to supply that information, Danielle, so that board members can just look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5453.412s">Okay,</a> so what... And I guess we can decide on the next date, and then between now and... <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5473.805s">Now</a> and then we can send you other questions via email.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5534.177s">Yeah,</a> any questions or suggested edits, as I agree with Peter, any questions or suggested edits should be able to be ironed out prior to, without another meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5566.689s">Do</a> we need a motion to for a day starting to 12, to continue to 12, 6, 2023? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5572.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5572.534s">I'm</a> going to start in alphabetical order here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5580.841s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5583.283s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5584.864s">Sharad</a> Bajraj Sharir?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1758.034s">And</a> because it's straightforward, technically all we're doing is, as you said, it's a formality where we're certifying that it's an approval not required because in this case, the city can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1769.148s">And</a> it meets all the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1770.489s">So,</a> for me, I don't know if there's any questions from the board, but I can just ask for a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1781.017s">Since</a> the city has affirmed that the criteria has been met, I'll ask for a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1787.913s">Although</a> there's no approval needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1794.275s">So</a> I guess we're just making sure that we're all in agreement just by doing a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1799.677s">Is</a> that what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1800.377s">A</a> motion to affirm? <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1804.098s">A</a> motion to certify that there's approval not needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1811.558s">Okay,</a> so actually, I guess I need a motion first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1816.52s">I'll</a> make a motion to affirm that approval is not needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1819.121s">Okay,</a> a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1821.742s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1824.403s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman? <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1826.524s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1827.565s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1830.786s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1832.447s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1833.627s">Sherrod</a> Batracharia?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=132.616s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=133.976s">So</a> our first item on the agenda for today is a special permit drive-through use. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=138.757s">The</a> 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bank of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=141.938s">It</a> was continued from 9-20-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=144.97s">The</a> applicant is applying for a special permit for a bank with drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the Wagons Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=152.036s">The</a> special permit grant authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the city board for the board's recommendation on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=158.582s">The</a> matter has been continued several times in order to redesign the site plan to satisfy planning staff and for sign off from other tenants of the shopping plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=170.222s">An</a> overall project summary is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Leonard Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=182.491s">The</a> proposed project will construct an approximate 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-through lane and one drive-through bypass lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=191.697s">I'm</a> going to now invite the applicant to present any updates to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=196.041s">Danielle,</a> can you please introduce all members of the applicant?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=271.686s">I</a> don't think it's a motion to table it to the end of the meet or later in the meet and just to another date certain.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=296.273s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=297.054s">We're</a> going to go to the next item on our agenda, which is 590 Boston Ave site plan review amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=302.838s">The</a> applicant is applying for an amendment to the previously approved site plan, special permit, and variances for the construction of a mixed use building that will contain 45 residential units and approximately 1,464 square feet of retail space with parking at grade located at the property 590 Boston Ave, Medford Mass, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=323.052s">The</a> original project was approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals in July 2021, but the design has been slightly revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=329.257s">The</a> applicant is invited to present to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=333.34s">Danielle,</a> can you please introduce the applicant?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1450.828s">Thank</a> you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1452.248s">One</a> of the things that I need, I guess, clarity from, I'm not sure if it's from the city or from the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1458.15s">If</a> you can just synthesize the information, you've gone over in detail, but we're trying to see where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1465.411s">We</a> know, we understand that we no longer need a parking variance and we, and there was, we, I could see the differences in the design. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1473.188s">But</a> I'm trying to better understand where we stand right now in reference to compliance with the department heads comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1480.594s">And,</a> um, I guess in the variances, if the city can pretty much point that out, I know that this was approved previously in 2020 with lots of conditions, but I'm having a hard time synthesizing all the information as you're presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1496.408s">So</a> if someone can just give us a high level, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1499.488s">overview</a> of exactly what variances that we're looking at right now and how far they are from compliance with the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1507.13s">That</a> would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1515.112s">Have</a> you had a chance to look at the department head comments?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1758.721s">Thank</a> you so much for your clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1762.804s">I'm</a> going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1764.969s">Ask</a> the city if you have any comments or if you want to add anything to better help the public and the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1777.956s">From</a> your point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1782.978s">Oh,</a> no, the city at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1784.619s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1785.359s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1962.922s">Thank</a> you so much, Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1964.443s">One</a> of the questions I have for clarification, previously when this was approved, there were conditions that <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1972.694s">we</a> would recommend with at least six units being affordable? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1977.035s">Is</a> that still on the table or has it been taken on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2002.708s">Go</a> right ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2227.835s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2228.155s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2228.515s">I'm</a> going to go to the board now and I just want to remind the public at this point or actually inform the public at this point to please remain refrain from using the chat at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2239.921s">We're</a> going to do a public comment period soon as we hear from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2243.824s">Emily?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2282.857s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2283.037s">And</a> I think that's pretty much what I was trying to get a high level bullet point of is what we hit and what we haven't just to get it synthesized so that we can know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2290.421s">Um,</a> so I guess as a board, we will decide if we have enough information to continue, or if this is something that we can approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2299.045s">I,</a> I, I'm not sure that I'm comfortable at this point myself recommending with conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2304.128s">Cause</a> I'm not sure what those conditions would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2307.188s">and</a> what they would not be, unless the city can help us with some language. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2312.71s">But</a> even then, we have to satisfy the affordable housing piece of it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2394.61s">Thank</a> you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2396.952s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to inject my two cents into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2403.937s">I</a> mean, I'm trying to

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3192.838s">Thank</a> you, Attorney Barone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3196.741s">Board</a> Member Sherrod Baracharia. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3205.229s">You're</a> on mute, Sherrod.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3338.283s">Are</a> there any further questions from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3340.364s">Okay,</a> I'm going to open up the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3348.948s">I</a> see that there was some activity in the chat, but we're unable to use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3353.85s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message among Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3359.83s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3364.293s">Individuals</a> may have up to two minutes to provide comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3366.714s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3370.436s">Just</a> another reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3378.521s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3386.687s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3743.333s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3745.534s">Barry</a> was all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3746.835s">I</a> know there was another question regarding handicap accessibility that was not included in the DEI's letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3756.121s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=3756.321s">Barry,</a> are you okay with that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4032.071s">Thank</a> you, Attorney Broome. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4033.171s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4036.214s">Danielle,</a> do you see any other public comments or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4039.676s">Barry,</a> are you all set?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4055.458s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4056.098s">I'm</a> going to close the public comment period and come back to the board at this time to see if there's any other clarifying questions or if there's anything that you want to ask of the city or the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4075.643s">Any</a> members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4078.227s">Yes,</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4080.89s">I</a> sorry, I can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4083.173s">Fishman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4086.271s">Hi,</a> Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4087.072s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4087.992s">Go</a> right ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4173.663s">I</a> think it's a, see where the board is at now for deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4178.906s">Are</a> you all comfortable with moving forward with the recommendation to the ZBA or are we looking to table this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4187.33s">I</a> think some of the, a lot of the questions that I had was the previous conditions for myself and where they stood, but we've already heard from the applicant that they're willing to comply as necessary with all <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4203.201s">department</a> had comments and then the process of affordability I can be handled with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4207.743s">So</a> I'm confident in handling that with the city, but I want to know what other board members are feeling at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4217.406s">Go</a> ahead, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4221.648s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. Quinn, I think, are you sharing your screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4225.129s">If</a> you could stop sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4230.271s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4311.722s">Okay,</a> so because we're making advisory recommendations, I guess at this point, I wanna be clear, Danielle, we are going with the previous conditions as well as a couple of new conditions, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4326.094s">If</a> the city wants to help us get this language proper so that someone can even <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4330.783s">Peter,</a> are you able to capture conditions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4424.678s">And</a> then that the proponent at this point, number three may be mute because the proponents should work with the city engineer to provide the additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4432.164s">At</a> this point, it's working with the city engineer as well as the fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4436.148s">But</a> I thought that was all encompassing with number four, which is compliance with recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4441.828s">to</a> the satisfaction of each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4443.79s">So</a> I want to make sure that we're fleshing out everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4446.732s">Because</a> if we're going to discuss each department head, it should be all inclusive, unless.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4637.492s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4637.813s">And</a> so, and that, and so instead of piecing, parsing that out to be its own item, it should be, um, all inclusive and number four for all department heads.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4776.254s">And</a> so as far as Gordon, that just, that also covers inclusionary housing at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4781.935s">Um,</a> that was called out separately originally, but it should just be compliant with the city as necessary because it's mandatory and not necessarily a condition.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4816.759s">So</a> yeah, so we're looking for a motion to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves the special permit for the site plan review for 590 Boston Ave with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4830.21s">Go</a> Peter.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4900.147s">And</a> if the city does not have anything to add on that language, we can go ahead and who wants to do the first motion?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4919.91s">Yes,</a> that's the one key word I left out was amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4923.453s">I</a> originally said to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4926.876s">So</a> we're recommending that the Board of Appeals approves the amended special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4934.482s">Is</a> that what it is?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4962.663s">I</a> second, Sally. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4967.385s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hedeman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4976.771s">Peter</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4980.983s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4987.687s">Ari</a> froze up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4994.152s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4995.333s">Pam</a> Marianski? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4996.814s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4998.575s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5000.536s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5002.037s">Sharad</a> Bharacharya?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5005.339s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5006.74s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5007.581s">So</a> that carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5013.119s">6,</a> 6, 1, the motion carries.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5019.901s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5020.441s">Have</a> a great evening.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5293.87s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5295.85s">So</a> we have attorney Jonathan Silverstein of BBHS Law, retained by the city of Medford and is available as support and counsel for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5304.152s">He</a> will assist the board in making any revisions to the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5307.273s">Board</a> members should feel free to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5310.434s">We</a> now ask the applicant for Walkman Court to introduce themselves and present their proposal, mainly highlighting and pointing out the differences of what that will include of what's allowed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5323.241s">um,</a> what's there now and what will be allowed there for the PDD. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5328.223s">Danielle,</a> do you want to introduce, um, the applicant?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5368.543s">Well,</a> if you have a presentation, you can introduce yourself as you go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5372.506s">We</a> will do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5698.1s">I</a> just want to just remind, as you go through, and I apologize for the interjection, is when you get to acronyms, if you can please just help the public and spell out any acronyms that may be used.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7330.535s">So,</a> when I conclude your presentation, I'm going to open it up to the city staff to add anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7338.699s">Any</a> questions from the city staff.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7365.455s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7365.956s">In</a> that case, are there any questions clarifying questions from the board?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7389.551s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7395.294s">Yes,</a> please go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7659.163s">Thank</a> you so much, actually, um, uh, Shirab for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7663.085s">Um,</a> and that, and that second part, I think that that would be more related in site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7667.006s">And,</a> and one of the things I want to remind the board of tonight is that the discussion is limited to amendment questions surrounding language in recommending, um, the zoning ordinance back to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7678.251s">However,</a> um, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7680.798s">I'm</a> going to defer to Attorney Silverstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7684.901s">I</a> just think I saw your hand up if you want to add something there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7729.777s">Thank</a> you so much attorney, so staying again, just to recap approval of the zoning doesn't necessarily approve the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7735.799s">We</a> still have to do our due diligence with the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7739.1s">So</a> we will save that for then. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7743.722s">Are</a> you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7745.823s">Or</a> do you have any other questions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7749.324s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7749.884s">Are</a> there any other questions from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7755.646s">Not</a> at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7756.347s">Thank</a> you, chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7759.247s">So,</a> I am going to open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7765.272s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7770.196s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7775.16s">Individuals</a> may have up to two minutes to provide comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7778.142s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7782.626s">Please</a> do not use the staff <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7785.083s">to</a> provide comments as it is not a part of the public record and just so that the public understands. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7789.906s">That's</a> why the chat feature has been disabled so that we can capture all of your comments for public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7796.889s">The</a> first hand that I saw, well, Danielle is going to manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails and letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7804.432s">But</a> I do know that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7805.412s">Roberta</a> Cameron was the very first person to put her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7809.274s">And</a> I'll let Danielle take it from there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10207.096s">Cal,</a> please go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10209.798s">Danielle,</a> can you unmute Cal?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10384.542s">I</a> actually was going to just refer to the actual application as read last as was noted last previous meeting on where the findings were and what is being done for environmental site assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10397.871s">And</a> at this time, if you can also just I'm going to refrain from the parking and anything else that does not deal directly with the amendment and outside of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10408.094s">The</a> actual zoning itself, but if you can just tell us a little bit more at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10417.622s">Just</a> to reiterate what has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10421.344s">As</a> far as environmental, not so much mediation as of yet, but what has been done as far as environmental impacts on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10434.244s">Assuming</a> that it's not in the actual that no one has can grab it right now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10953.431s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10955.272s">I'm</a> actually going to, at this time, if there's no other comments that need to be read or there's no other hands up, I'm going to close the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10963.219s">And</a> at this time I will defer back to the city and just, if the city can highlight for us in a high level vote point and give us some information, give the board and the public some information about how these goals align with the city's goals, how this project aligns with the city's goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10982.826s">or</a> I can actually, Danielle, did you want me to read those out or did you wanna touch base on them to give the public a better idea?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11191.936s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11192.596s">One</a> of the things that I wanted to flesh out without going into full detail is the 40B statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11197.1s">I'm</a> not sure that the public is fully aware of what 40B and how it affects SHI, which is the state subsidized housing inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11205.666s">There's</a> a certain percentage that every community within the state of Massachusetts has to hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11210.609s">And</a> if there's not a low to moderate income housing that's met within a community, then <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11218.375s">that</a> community is subjected to a 40B, which is MGL chapter 40B, which is a comprehensive permit law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11224.238s">And</a> that's what Danielle was referring to, where a developer can come in and take your prime space and it doesn't have to follow regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11233.942s">So</a> this is a better way of controlling your housing when you have a housing production goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11239.325s">And</a> the city can actually speak more on that, but I did want to flesh out some of the acronyms that we were using to discuss the housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11248.747s">Are</a> there any other questions from the board at this time?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11280.901s">I</a> agree, Vice Chair Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11282.822s">As</a> I said, it's not that we were neglecting your comments, but they're more specific to the site itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11289.408s">And</a> this is, we're trying to get the zoning done so that we can get the project to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11293.772s">If</a> the project moves forward, once the zoning is approved, then we can do our due diligence and making sure that it conforms to all city ordinances within. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11303.261s">So</a> in saying that, if there's no other, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11306.388s">questions</a> from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11307.408s">Again,</a> I feel very confident that Attorney Silverstein as well as M. H. A. And the city staff has already done their, uh, their iterative processes of going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11318.611s">So</a> I will ask for a motion to recommend, uh, the motion to recommend to City Council of the approval of the draft PDV three walk on court plan development district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11331.274s">I'll</a> make the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11332.015s">The</a> second motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11335.625s">I</a> second, Sammy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11339.486s">Roll</a> call, Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=355.955s">Kadisha</a> Hindi, co-principal at Vernon Bio.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=404.174s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=405.155s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=406.456s">Are</a> there any members of the board <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=410.103s">that</a> were not participating previously that would have questions for the proponent? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=422.57s">Because</a> at this point, if you were absent on the first hearing, you are now able to participate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=574.258s">Thank</a> you for asking, Attorney Gordon. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=577.08s">At</a> this time, I think if you can give us a high-level overview of what the actual amendments are, since there's no changes from, but at the same time, because one of our board members was not present, I'm guessing he may want to see a little bit more of the proposal that's <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=597.418s">so</a> that he can, at that point, know. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=599.763s">Peter,</a> if I'm not correct, if I'm correct, are you looking for the proponent to do an actual overview? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=606.195s">Or</a> do you just want to do a high level?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=638.502s">Then</a> in that case, Attorney Wiseman, because it's being immediately referred back from the city council and to me, um, standing alone and saying this, I think it's just more of an administrative process of it coming back to the board to be represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=650.411s">If</a> you could just give us the high level, um, details, I think that would suffice.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1120.059s">Thank</a> you, attorney.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1124.123s">Are</a> there any other questions from board members? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1133.872s">So</a> yes, I do have one for, um, attorney Rosemond and that's just, it sounds like at this point, um, unless I'm missing something, it's already gone through an inner, an inner process back, um, with yourself and, um, attorney Heffernan, um, with comments from city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1154.089s">So</a> I, I don't have any other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1158.392s">I</a> want to know if there was any concerns from the city or from yourself at this, at this juncture.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1224.59s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1225.211s">I</a> appreciate your full detail.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1232.281s">If</a> there's no other questions from the board, I will open up for public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1237.751s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1242.073s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1246.734s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1252.076s">Danielle,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1353.21s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1354.063s">Then</a> at this point, I will look for a motion to recommend the PDE for 282.43 for the planned development district for the zoning amendment to the city council for recommendation of adoption for review and possible adoption. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1377.733s">I</a> so move.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1418.302s">And</a> thank you, attorney with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1420.504s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1420.944s">Have</a> a great evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1424.606s">Good</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1424.986s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1428.389s">The</a> next item on our agenda tonight is approval of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1434.632s">Before</a> we move to approve the minutes, I do have one quick thing and that's just the consistency of, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1442.518s">I</a> guess my title within some places it says chair, some places it says vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1447.467s">But</a> other than that, I don't see a problem with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1453.337s">And</a> these are the minutes from August 2nd, 2023.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1483.683s">Yes,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1484.443s">And</a> that's, and that's literally what I was, um, I didn't know if anyone else had any changes or anything like that, but if, if no further changes or concerns, uh, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1497.668s">A</a> motion to approve the minutes from August 2nd, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1500.389s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1506.951s">And</a> a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1508.992s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1511.987s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1513.408s">Peter</a> Cowles? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1515.37s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1516.33s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1517.911s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1518.812s">Pam</a> Marianski? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1520.213s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1522.054s">Sharad</a> Bharacharya?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1525.336s">Myself,</a> Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1527.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1530.199s">Our</a> next item would be, sorry, it's just miscellaneous items if the city has anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1540.346s">or</a> any other updates or anything for us at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1553.228s">There</a> was one that I wanted to just call myself, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1557.909s">And</a> that's just recognizing the Roberts Rules of Order. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1562.41s">And</a> that's that all of us have anyone can put <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1568.176s">have</a> the ability to discuss within a meeting, obviously, and present a motion, but they must be recognized through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1574.458s">So</a> going forward, I just want to make sure that as we proceed with these meetings, that any discussions or motions put on a table are actually through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1583.841s">And</a> I'm just stating that for public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1593.564s">And</a> if there's anything else from the city or <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1599.358s">Our</a> next meeting is October 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1602.12s">That's</a> correct, Daniel?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1644.265s">I</a> don't know if the board can vote on that, but I am highly interested in that debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1652.345s">That</a> night, and I know that it's recorded, but I've been anticipating it for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1657.449s">So</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1659.03s">I</a> don't know that others would participate that night if we would have full participation of items.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1686.381s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I would definitely be available for me and don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1689.601s">It's</a> just I was going back to if <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1693.542s">Whoever's</a> presenting materials for the meeting that night, if they're interested in continuing, I'd be OK with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1771.623s">Yeah,</a> because I wanted to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1774.124s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1775.49s">And</a> then I think about it, I don't, I personally, and this is for the board's review, wouldn't want to see all of those items pushed on to the next meeting, and then we're there all night either. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1786.939s">So,</a> I don't know, whatever you decide, whatever is decided, if you can let us know, I guess.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1807.84s">So</a> I do have a question on that since we have a full quorum and that's not so much discussing the item itself, but I'm just, I'm curious as to how the city's rectifying their situation with, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1820.673s">or</a> if the city is even involved with the tenant versus landlord parking issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1827.74s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1828.16s">Is</a> that going to continuously be a thing or are you asking for some proof to move forward?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1932.841s">At</a> this point, they're not agreeing, but there's a possibility that they can agree on something that's still not in compliance with city zone for the parking lot.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1960.306s">That's</a> what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1961.566s">Not</a> so much zoning, but for the parking lot itself and how many parking spaces are supposed to be there and so forth, is what I meant.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2514.642s">I'm</a> just smiling, because when it comes to MBTA communities, and I'm sure this is not a conflict, but I always literally I have Chris Clutchman at my disposal, like, can you can you explain this to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2524.608s">And</a> so now that it's met for it, it's like, I don't have that to explain it to me, because I can't reach out for it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2543.313s">she's</a> my old boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2546.795s">She</a> just got she's like moving on up over and what is the executive office of communities and livable cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2554.181s">H?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2555.682s">The</a> old DHT? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2556.883s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2558.864s">Yeah,</a> she's now she took over for her former boss, which I don't really know what that title is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2563.427s">But</a> she's like heading up that department now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2565.869s">So</a> which is cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2567.87s">Anyways,</a> alright, so I don't want to drone on about things. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2571.753s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2578.213s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2629.845s">You</a> know, as a board, we will review it for the highest and best use for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2634.046s">I'm</a> sure we will, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2635.347s">All</a> of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2636.707s">We'll</a> see what's what.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2639.128s">That's</a> what we're here for.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2654.097s">Yes,</a> I wasn't trying to shut it down myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2656.418s">I</a> don't want to I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2659.019s">Me</a> as it wasn't board member, I wouldn't want to not have the meet and just because. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2664.921s">I</a> can, I can always view the debate later, which would be a bummer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2669.383s">However.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2671.052s">especially</a> if there's pressing items on the agenda or so many items that they would spill over to the following meeting and we would be there all night.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2702.178s">And</a> Walkland Court, that will be their third time coming before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2707.099s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2729.7s">Yeah,</a> that's a, well, I know that's not at your level, but I was talking to Danielle about that the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2734.241s">That's</a> one of those, I just, I don't get the second meat and it just feels like it should be, it's an administrative process that feels like it should just be handled with the city solicitor or the city clerk and not coming back to city. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2746.944s">But</a> who am I to talk?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2858.773s">So</a> it's a public hearing, but I'm still, and this is not to hash out here, I'm just so confused on the legal process of it coming before us for the initial recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2870.322s">They</a> refer it back to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2871.923s">Because</a> city council can't do it for, like, whatever, a certain amount of days, it comes back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2878.226s">I</a> feel like that is where it can be clinked up at or coordinated, but I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2886.07s">Maybe</a> I'll read Lynn's handbook to try to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2890.252s">I'm</a> not a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2891.532s">It</a> just sounds like there's something disconnected in the process that... <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2897.747s">wouldn't</a> matter legally as long as we're following the proper administrative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2901.976s">But</a> again, I don't, I'm not strong in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2904.762s">I'm</a> still trying to figure it out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2934.751s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2935.112s">So</a> since we are the ones, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2936.773s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2937.273s">I</a> think it's, yeah.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2961.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2963.129s">All</a> right, well, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2963.849s">I</a> won't belabor that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2965.71s">Alicia,</a> thank you so much for letting us know about things to come going forward and not to hold us up anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2973.374s">I</a> don't know if there's any other updates that anyone wants to provide, but I will ask for a motion for adjournment, if not. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2987.181s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2989.042s">A</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2993.203s">Peter</a> Kautz?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=91.703s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=97.172s">Amanda,</a> can you please introduce any city staff on the call?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=123.207s">Thank</a> you, Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=125.227s">So</a> the first item on our agenda tonight is a special permit for the drive-thru use at 3850 Misty Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=132.148s">which</a> is Bank of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=133.79s">It's</a> been, it's been continued from August 16th, uh, 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=139.535s">Just</a> to give an overview, the applicant is applying for a special permit for a drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is in the Wiggins Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=147.903s">The</a> special permit grant in authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the seating board for the board's recommendations on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=154.168s">The</a> applicant is advised to present to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=157.653s">An</a> overall summary actually is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Linden Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=170.918s">The</a> proposed project will construct an approximately 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-thru lane and one drive-thru bypass lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=181.129s">Amanda,</a> can you introduce all members in representation of Bank of America? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=187.394s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=541.654s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Lucas. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=542.755s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=545.277s">Before</a> I get into questions and open up the questions, I want to see if the city wanted to address, I know that there was some comments from the department heads that you had referenced, and I didn't know if there were anyone from the fire department or from the DPW engineering for the city that would be on, or if the PDS staff is willing to give us a background on some of the concerns that were highlighted before. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=579.609s">Danielle</a> or Alicia?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=636.59s">So</a> for me, anyways, there were some significant changes to the actual proposal, but at the same time, there were substantive concerns and comments from the fire chief, as well as DPW engineering and PDS staff that I think for my own standing on the board, I would need to further hash out before I could even provide <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=663.177s">a</a> recommendation to move forward, or even a ruling at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=668.28s">I</a> don't know how the city would want me to handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=671.962s">And</a> I don't know how the other board members feel about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=674.984s">I</a> just, without, in the absence of knowing if things have been satisfied with the department heads, I wouldn't know how to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=685.21s">Not</a> even with conditions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1019.465s">And</a> I do have that, but I don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1022.95s">And</a> that's I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1065.303s">If</a> you don't mind, I'm going to open it up to the board if there's any clarifying questions from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1071.025s">So</a> that's not just my voice on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1078.667s">Do</a> any board members have any clarifying questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1083.729s">Concerns</a> or comments?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1223.794s">Oh,</a> yes, please go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1225.955s">Miss</a> Benefield.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1313.227s">Thank</a> you for adding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1315.909s">That</a> was 1 of the questions that I was actually going to raise to the PDF staff is because within the response to the PDFs, there was questions about parking and I saw there the response from the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1331.992s">landlord</a> stating that it must meet the parking requirements for various lease on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1337.955s">Not</a> only that, lease restrictions and parking changes will have to be the approval of all tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1342.737s">So</a> I was kind of trying to figure out how that was addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1347.799s">And</a> Danielle, if you can please go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1351.161s">I</a> see you have your hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1506.901s">The</a> clerk can call the vote, which is Peter, but I can
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1516.916s">But</a> I would still, I believe you'd have to do the whole call attendance because you probably don't have that readily available.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1523.441s">I</a> don't have that in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1525.942s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1528.444s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1530.866s">It's</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1532.247s">Vice-chair</a> Emily Hedeman? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1534.708s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1536.35s">Peter</a> Cowles?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3453.79s">Thank</a> you, Attorney Silverstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3455.051s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3456.251s">I</a> want to remind the board and the public before we move forward, again, that as Attorney Silverstein has already noticed, we were given a high-level conceptual presentation by Medford Housing Authority and their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3472.145s">Although</a> we're focusing only on zoning, like the uses and the dimensions for this first meeting, although the vision informs the zoning, we're going to save all the rest for the site plan review at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3485.81s">And</a> because it's dimensional and zoning and all bound in law, for my purposes, I do not have any more questions that attorney Silverstein has not already answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3499.608s">So</a> at this time, I'm going to open it up to the board for any questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3530.752s">Exactly.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4012.176s">I</a> think the most efficient way is in case an actual member of the public has to jump the meeting before we get to the end, maybe we can address individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4022.42s">And</a> especially in case the same question comes up again, we have it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4033.536s">I</a> believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4034.396s">No,</a> I think you should probably I think we should probably address them individually in case the person that the member of the public that asked the question has to jump before the end of the meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4243.759s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4244.7s">Jensen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4245.44s">Actually,</a> I'm going to come back to this and I just realized to make sure that we are staying on task and we're answering and that the proponent feels comfortable answering the questions that's related to zoning and the questions that you actually feel are relevant to the case, not that all of the public comments are not relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4262.093s">Amanda,</a> how about we do take a tally of the questions as we go through and then decide which ones are relevant to tonight's public hearing and have the proponent answer the ones that they're able to at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4275.403s">to</a> keep it more efficient.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4413.97s">And</a> for clarification, not that we're answering this question now, I just want the city to take note in response to environmental metric. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4422.093s">This</a> site is not an environmental justice site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4425.133s">I</a> just wanted to make that clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4444.928s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4455.997s">Mm-hmm.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6430.184s">Thank</a> you, Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6432.987s">At</a> this time, I'm going to ask if the board has any other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6438.533s">I'm</a> going to actually first before the board, I'll close the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6445.332s">and</a> then ask the board if there's any other questions that you have.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6463.638s">Yes,</a> and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6464.899s">We</a> originally said that we were gonna answer them case by case, but Amanda has helped me to collect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6469.8s">And</a> Amanda, have you collected the ones that were relevant to tonight's public hearing?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6763.408s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6763.628s">Moran,</a> for clarification, when you said it would trigger something higher, can you be more specific for the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6768.654s">Were</a> you speaking about the MEPA office or anything dealing with the EEA in Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6774.141s">I</a> just wanted the public to understand how detailed of an environmental assessment you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6779.307s">done</a> and what that entails.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6847.568s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6848.309s">I</a> appreciate that question, that clarification, especially where I wanted the public going back to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6853.952s">Diane</a> McKinney's reference to environmental justice area that MEPA actually has dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6860.757s">They</a> have dedicated resources for projects that are near environmental justice populations, which I have clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6869.028s">In</a> my error earlier, not realizing that this area was an environmental justice area, it's Block Group 1, Census Tract 3394, as you stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6878.017s">And</a> it's one of the criterias that the state uses for being environmental justice is that it's hugely minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6884.663s">I</a> just wanted to put that on the record for the public information. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6890.238s">Sorry,</a> Amanda, if you can continue.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7735.946s">There's</a> no other public comments at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7741.791s">Actually,</a> I see one from an Anne.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7752.919s">Okay,</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7753.719s">All</a> right, I will open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7757.022s">I</a> will close the public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7759.223s">I</a> will open it up for board members, and now I see Ari's hand.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7992.76s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Morissette. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7994.001s">And</a> for Ari, as well as members of the public, this adverse report that Mr. Morissette is referring to was prepared by Urban Forestry Solutions Incorporated, and it was provided as exhibit F in the board materials and public materials for the project, if you want to go into further detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8012.348s">Are</a> there any other questions from the board?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8128.981s">If</a> there are no other questions, I just wanted to thank Martha Helsing for your extensive detailed presentation as well as all of your consultant team. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8143.429s">And</a> because tonight's discussion is limited to many questions about language, et cetera, I'm going to just trust that attorney's own team with his extensive background in land use litigation and so forth in getting this amendment out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8160.341s">has</a> already helped you to get to that so natural, faster, or the best path permanently going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8167.604s">So</a> to get you started, I'm going to ask the board for a motion to recommend the drafted PDD rezoning ordinance for one and in three to 20 walk-in court to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8180.69s">I'll</a> make the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8182.65s">Do</a> I hear a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8186.092s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8190.425s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8192.707s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8194.109s">Ari</a> Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8195.91s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8197.411s">Pam</a> Marianski. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8199.013s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8200.354s">Chad</a> Baracharia.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8204.218s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8205.839s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8206.139s">Thank</a> you so much and we look forward to doing our due diligence later after the revisions for the site plan review.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8242.293s">So</a> our next item on the agenda is site plan review for 421 and 423 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8249.762s">And</a> I will read the public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8260.383s">The</a> Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on September 6, 2023 after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8265.411s">via</a> Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8266.573s">Remote</a> video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by RJM Development LLC. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8274.006s">37</a> West Street, Medford Mass, 02155, regarding construction of a nine-unit residential structure with approximately 1,000 square feet of commercial space located in both commercial one and single family one zoning districts at 421 to 423 High Street, Medford Mass, 02155, otherwise known as parcel number L-04-7879.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10316.565s">Thank</a> you so much, Attorney Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10318.646s">There's</a> one point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10320.768s">The</a> right of way, if I'm not mistaken, on the presentation said it was 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10325.591s">However,</a> if you're going to reduce it to one way, the requirements for the city is 12 feet for one way.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10370.42s">And</a> I have a few other questions in regards to day use and what your relief was, but I think probably this is where I'll just leave it for the comments from city staff, especially, specifically Danielle Evans, if she can speak more directly on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10386.725s">She'll</a> probably be able to clarify for me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10868.899s">My</a> biggest question was on vehicle conflict, and I think it's pretty much been hashed out, but I'm still not sure that the city is satisfied with the response as far as. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10884.475s">as</a> it's been presented.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11176.101s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11176.662s">Desmond.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11434.6s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11435.1s">Are</a> there any other questions from the city staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11445.282s">How</a> about clarifying questions from the board?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11511.23s">Danielle,</a> did you have a question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11694.871s">I</a> just want to, Amanda, are you capturing the conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11701.377s">And</a> I'm just wondering how these conditions will align with the traffic comments that have already been submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11709.085s">Are</a> we looking to add or just focusing on a few of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11717.613s">And</a> that's more of a question for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11727.334s">And</a> Dr. Hunt, is that your way of actually mitigating for the vehicle conflict and you'll be okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11736.701s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11740.884s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11744.227s">If</a> there's no further questions from the board at this time, I'm going to open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11753.397s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message landed in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11757.62s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at method-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11763.404s">Individuals</a> have up to three minutes to provide comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11765.746s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11769.108s">A</a> reminder to all the meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11776.173s">However,</a> if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11783.178s">and</a> staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11784.438s">Amanda,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent in emails or letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11812.49s">I'm</a> going to close the public comment period at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11816.332s">And</a> just return back to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11820.313s">To</a> discuss potential conditions for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11823.215s">If</a> we're going to give approval to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11826.076s">If</a> you have any clarifying questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11829.798s">And</a> again, my only clarifying question moving forward is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11834.2s">At</a> this point, I think the site plan, I would myself recommend the site plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11841.467s">For</a> approval, considering everything has been adhered to as part of the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11849.532s">Comment</a> and anything that the city staff has added this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11860.218s">If</a> there's no additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11867.562s">And</a> if you agree, then I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11871.684s">elicit</a> a motion that says such, but with Amanda reading out the additional conditions for us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11953.534s">I</a> think they're already being addressed, but just to cover it, I wanted to just condition that I didn't want to let it go without making note to the comments and without the actual representative, the department heads here themselves, just to make sure that they're touching base and compliant.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12351.255s">And</a> this is a heavy TOD area, correct, as presented?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12367.407s">Yeah,</a> my, I know it's not a thing much with the advent of Uber and other personal, and other taxi services, but like, I know when, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12380.401s">Tenants</a> say that they're not going to have parking, then they'll get like a rental or a zip car or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12384.602s">And</a> then you still create an on-street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12387.283s">So</a> I'm good with keeping 18 in.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12411.1s">Yes,</a> so going back to that, will there be a sign parking?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12532.061s">This</a> is only relevant if there was an incentive to not have parking as
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12564.752s">OK,</a> so to recap, we are striking <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12570.863s">Peter,</a> can you help me? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12572.043s">We're</a> getting rid of one.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12619.586s">And</a> which one, I'm sorry, what number on fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12635.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12640.372s">If</a> we can sort of wordsmith this to get a motion to recommend with the removal of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12653.821s">Do</a> we even have to, do we have to explicitly name out the comments that were taken out, striking? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12665.541s">If</a> I may? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12666.502s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12679.555s">If</a> you can give it a shot, Amanda.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12741.831s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12742.312s">Okay,</a> roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12748.156s">Vice</a> Chair Emily Hederman? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12750.578s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12752.039s">Peter</a> Cowles?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12866.96s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12872.568s">Hey,</a> there's miscellaneous. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12874.629s">I</a> have another update before we go to miscellaneous another update. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12878.451s">Very</a> happy birthday to Alicia.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12917.428s">Did</a> the city have any other updates or miscellaneous that you wanted to give us?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13094.473s">And</a> I have a quick one and I promise this is really quick and it helps us with the organization of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13100.074s">I</a> wanted the board to, for us to start thinking about rules and regulations for how we <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13106.15s">on</a> how the board actually operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13108.192s">And</a> something I spoke to Danielle about is, like, I don't know if there's a way that we can legally impose, like, deadlines for proponents to send things in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13117.481s">If</a> they send it in on a Friday after certain hours and then the city doesn't have a chance to get to it or it gets to us later. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13123.226s">It's</a> just something legally that we're able to do to help us with, to help the city with their lift and then to help us to have a little bit more time
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13157.717s">And</a> again, I don't know the legalities behind if we can even talk about it because it's not really an item on agenda, but it's an item for ourselves as administrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13165.587s">So</a> I think we can talk about it in email. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13167.249s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13169.772s">No,</a> because it's going to be part of the board's actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13173.076s">So</a> we can't talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13175.365s">I</a> don't know, just not for tonight, but just to put it in your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13178.447s">What</a> can we do to help ourselves?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13240.959s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13243.36s">Even</a> the close of Business Friday, is that pushing it for you guys?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13355.233s">I'm</a> asking, I can't actually give the motion, so I need one motion and then a second.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=875.659s">And</a> as far as. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=877.92s">You</a> had mentioned that you were going to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=881.361s">Native</a> plants, such as shrubs, can you go into detail a little bit more outside of the new shade trees that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=889.093s">that</a> you planned on adding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=890.193s">I</a> didn't I didn't catch anything outside of shrubs.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=925.83s">Yes,</a> prior to the final selection, you would need to coordinate it with the city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=932.871s">I'm</a> sorry, Danielle, did you want to highlight anything else?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=969.165s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=971.046s">And</a> then there was parking demand to reduce the cruising for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=976.507s">Are</a> you able to mandate that the employees park in the rear as suggested previously?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=995.328s">And</a> so they're popular, you'll still leave it open of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=999.051s">Wayfinding</a> signs for the actual customers to realize that there's parking back there too.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1333.64s">I</a> actually have a final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1335.561s">I</a> wasn't sure if there was going to be a food court of some sort that was proposed inside of the store.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1355.61s">So</a> can you just reiterate your trash and litter mitigation for the site, especially for this having a food court?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1649.268s">Right,</a> let's let's discuss some conditions and see if we can actually get this going so that we can possibly get to an approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1657.542s">If</a> that's okay with the board to see if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1661.499s">pretty</a> much deliberate on that for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1663.22s">Um,</a> there was some new, uh, in addition to the shade trees that the proponent has showed us, there was a discussion of some native plantings to make sure that, um, the parking lot would be, um, that the heat island effect would be reduced off the parking lot, um, within previous materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1681.476s">And</a> the proponent has already said that they will be working with, um, city staff, uh, to determine final selection of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1688.261s">That</a> would be a condition I would impose.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1700.435s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1701.075s">I</a> so I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1704.297s">Usually</a> Amanda acting in the realm of clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1708.279s">As</a> of right now, Amanda, I just want to clarify that you are going along with our are you recording our conditions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1741.307s">Yes</a> and so to clarify on my end, I'm reading what the PDS staff has provided us with and I want to see how the board feels about these conditions and if you want to adopt them to go forward for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1754.37s">And</a> the first one would be in addition to the new shade trees, we're talking about native planning such as the flowering shrubs that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1766.793s">Weatherby</a> has already discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1770.923s">If</a> the board is OK with that approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1772.804s">Yeah,</a> but with that conditions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1824.451s">So</a> I'll just go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1827.569s">And</a> as discussed, in order to meet customer parking demand and reduce cruising for the parking behavior, which creates congestion and reduces pedestrian safety, employees and staff will be required to park in the rear parking lot, as well as wayfinding signs be provided to make customers aware of the availability of the rear parking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1873.366s">And,</a> of course, the proposal will comply with the requirements of the fire chief's memo dated 6 to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1879.19s">During</a> the original 6 to 2023 from the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1887.175s">Yes,</a> and we also confirmed that the drive aisles all meet the requirements too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1893.517s">And</a> in accordance with the city engineering comments and their memo dated 6-2-2023, the heaved and cracked panels of the sidewalk along Meadow Avenue must be replaced in conformance with city standards.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1928.181s">And</a> this is for public purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1934.222s">I'll</a> read out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1935.062s">In</a> accordance with the city engineering comments in their memo dated 6-2-2023, driveway apron must be reconstructed to ensure conformance with MAAB regulations, particularly in regard to cross slopes, widths, and accessible paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1947.905s">The</a> accessible walkway, which is a sidewalk, should cross the apron via Portland cement concrete panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1958.607s">And</a> then the final one that we had was just to ensure that trash and litigation for the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1965.23s">Especially</a> with there being a full court, and you said you would work with the board of health on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2008.533s">So,</a> you'll just work with the board of health on appropriate trash and mitigation for those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2016.818s">Does</a> the support have any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2019.4s">For</a> 1, do we accept all these conditions as is, or does the board have anything to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2025.864s">Or</a> subtract if none.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2056.503s">Yes,</a> and that would be part of one of the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2061.106s">Or</a> actually two, so that's all encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2065.209s">So</a> the site I am <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2067.501s">So,</a> a roll call for acceptance of the site plan site plan approval with conditions as stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2073.603s">I'll</a> do a roll call vice chair Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2077.685s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2080.146s">Peter</a> cows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2093.831s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2094.011s">Fishman.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2114.513s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2115.293s">And</a> I actually said that at the beginning, and I'm so used to doing roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2118.434s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2118.994s">We're</a> going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2120.535s">New</a> board members are not eligible because you were not part of the board at the time that the public hearing was opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2128.957s">So</a> we are going to go back and start over.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2144.237s">You</a> count those votes?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2145.878s">And</a> then we'll call because it's remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2152.203s">So</a> just for clarity, I will go back vice chair Emily Hederman. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2157.186s">I</a> Peter cows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2161.71s">Ari</a> Fishman?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2164.432s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2168.073s">Your</a> site plan has been approved with the conditions as stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2171.994s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2172.635s">Wetherby,</a> thank you so much for your presentation and for your time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2176.756s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2182.599s">We're</a> excited to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2184.139s">Well,</a> to have H-Mart. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2187.58s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2187.961s">Have</a> a great night, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2189.265s">You</a> too, bye-bye. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2190.366s">Okay,</a> so the next item on the list tonight is special permit for 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is Bank of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2202.873s">It</a> was continued from 7-19-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2204.814s">The</a> applicant is in the processes of revising the plan documents for the board's review and has requested a continuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2211.498s">I'd</a> like to entertain a motion to continue this item to the next board meeting, which is a date certain on 9-6-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2220.763s">A</a> 2nd 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2224.105s">Roll</a> call vice chair and we had a man. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2226.907s">I</a> Peter cows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2230.709s">I.</a> Are you fishermen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2233.571s">I.</a> Pam Mary asking I. Sally, a key key. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2239.174s">I</a> sure I watched her. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2244.177s">And</a> myself, Jackie mcpherson's I. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2247.368s">So</a> it's been moved to 9623. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2249.429s">And</a> our next item on the list is petition referred from city council for zoning ordinance amendments, which has continued from 8 to 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2256.874s">I'm</a> going to invite Danielle Evans, which is senior planner for the city to present any changes to the amendment to the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2657.262s">Is</a> this the one related to keeping certain uses off of places like Mystic Avenue, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2679.625s">So</a> to me, just quickly, it does make sense that the planning board, as Daniel has already outlined, and yourself has already outlined, Lucia, that we see things more holistically with the city's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2692.336s">I</a> guess it comes to one of those things where I feel like it should be an elected board that is special from a granting agency, but I mean, authority, but <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2707.369s">If</a> you're saying that you want, I can definitely see what you mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2712.07s">I</a> guess I had some hesitations before because it almost looked like we were trying to keep certain uses out on purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2719.192s">But</a> if it's because you want it to be looked at more holistically, I just wanted to clarify that with the board that it just, as you said, it makes sense that we're actually looking at it at the city's vision.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2845.673s">And</a> who's obligated to get the city's highest and best use for a site, right?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2892.454s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2894.215s">Same.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3662.81s">Daniel,</a> I don't want to cut you off, but if you had referred to 3 a, and I don't know if you wanted to just just for public purposes at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3674.661s">Sort</a> of explain that 3 is related to the multi house and actor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3678.284s">There's</a> only that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3740.894s">Having</a> inclusionary housing previously by special meant, which is didn't pretty much make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3745.838s">This</a> is meant should be mandatory for the that's just that would be in conflict with the rule, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3751.882s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4720.665s">I'm</a> still getting into E-H-O-L-C.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4749.223s">Mike</a> a clarifying question for number 5 are so the board's not able to vote on that one side because you still have to parse it out with the legal counsel to make sure that it's being presented properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4760.23s">Even</a> if you take out some of the information that you have there, it needs to be reviewed by legal.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4928.924s">My</a> only question, and that's for the board for deliberation, is that we understand that this is an interim step to hold over to zone revisions, and you want to get these administrative changes done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4941.013s">And</a> to me as one board member, I can definitely vote on the other ones, but number five, I thought that there was like a process legally that before we change anything, we just had to make sure we were okay with what we're changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4952.416s">And</a> I don't know that I've wrapped my full head around exactly what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4958.357s">And</a> I don't know if the board has, but I would also be inclined to say that I could recommend approval once you figure it out, once the city staff figured it out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5103.432s">So</a> I'll open it up to the board now for clarifying questions and just to see exactly the temperature of where we're going with this and to see if there's any other questions that the board may have of Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5114.934s">Daniel,</a> if you're finished with your presentation, that is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5379.517s">If</a> there's no more questions from the board, because this is still a public hearing, I'm going to open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5386.598s">I'm</a> not sure that there's public on, but I will read. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5389.319s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hands feature or message Amanda in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5393.78s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5398.841s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5402.701s">Amanda,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5432.24s">Okay,</a> I'm going to close the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5437.675s">and</a> go back to board deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5440.336s">And</a> I will just start by just, I will leave the floor open for the board members to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5450.501s">But</a> at this point, I appreciate the city's, all of the work that Daniel and other city staff has done in trying to identify these potential misaligned uses slash rules and rectify for ease for the city and ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5464.467s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5466.267s">Before</a> I ask for a motion, I will ask if there is anything that the board wants to add.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5497.112s">Okay,</a> I'm going to ask for potential motion to recommend approval of the proposed proposed ordinance amendments to the city council with the condition of Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5507.579s">Can</a> you help me capture that language for a number 5? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5510.281s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5593.681s">Are</a> there any objections? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5595.062s">I</a> do have one clarifying question on the marijuana and signed definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5598.264s">Maybe</a> I didn't capture that one in my conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5600.806s">What</a> was that one that we discussed for that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5861.831s">Okay,</a> I'm going to try this again potential motion to recommend approval of the zoning ordinance amendments to City Council.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5875.997s">I</a> was going to read the motions just for public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5880.72s">In</a> addition to the definitions with the following conditions, in addition to the definitions included in the paper, to also include the marijuana and signed definitions from the former zoning ordinances in section 12.0, recommend that SBGA for the adjusted C2 uses be the CDB, <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5900.378s">For</a> item number five, delegate to the PDS to update the language reflecting what was discussed, included in the recommendation to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5910.02s">Recommend</a> that city council delete the existing tables and replace with the recommended table from the CDB as presented in the PDS staff meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5930.902s">Second</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5932.003s">Alright</a> roll call vice chair Emily had a minute.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5940.507s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5945.03s">Peter,</a> were you at Peter? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5947.791s">Did</a> you read this or I?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5959.677s">Pam</a> Marianski. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5962.197s">Yes,</a> Sally Kiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5964.958s">Yes,</a> and myself, Jackie person. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5968.679s">Yes,</a> that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5975.16s">Unanimously</a> accepted for recommendations for the city council.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5990.658s">Next</a> item, board elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5994.981s">So</a> this is continued from 8 to 23, where we have re-established a chair, myself, as well as Emily Hederman is now the vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6004.307s">And</a> we still have a clerk position open and a community preservation committee representative open. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6011.312s">And</a> we were going to wait until we had full members to entertain those as of right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6019.042s">Ari</a> Fishman is in is sort of in the. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6023.725s">CPA</a> role, are you currently in that and you're. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6028.227s">Looking</a> to probably, you're just holding it over until someone else is able to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6033.39s">And</a> so those 2 positions are open. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6035.971s">Amanda,</a> can you give a little bit of background on both positions for the new board members?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6349.092s">Is</a> there anyone else that would want to throw their head in for Clark, or even CPA representative.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6598.492s">So,</a> I'm going to start with a motion to elect Peter cows as the clerk of the metric community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6606.017s">2nd.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=6659.922s">Okay,</a> so Amanda, what you were saying is someone else to make a motion or okay.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1499.759s">your</a> detailed of the uses and you're going back and forth with, you know, just giving us, filling us the new board members in from previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1517.88s">Before</a> I open it up, Amanda, I'm not sure if we should have Attorney Orzman step in here and pretty much set the stage before we get to the public comment, or should we go straight to the public comment first?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1602.504s">Thank</a> you attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1603.785s">I</a> think that's where we're trying to get to, um, um, without the public and the board having a reference to those iterations, uh, that you and the proponent have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1613.27s">Um,</a> I'm just not, I'm not sure at this point, um, if how to guide the, the meeting going forward, I want to make sure that we're doing right by the city as well as a proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1625.036s">Um,</a> so I guess at this time I will request, um, if there are any comments from the city staff.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1823.172s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1823.532s">And</a> that's pretty much where I know it's a public hearing, but that's what I was trying to guide to stay at a conversation for the public and what we were opening it up for prior to opening it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1832.819s">So</a> thank you for referencing that, Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1837.703s">But</a> at this time, I will, I'll ask for clarifying questions to solicit from the board first before opening it up from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1848.372s">Does</a> anyone from the board have any clarifying questions before we open it up
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2154.769s">Thank</a> you, Attorney Osmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2156.23s">One</a> of my actual questions is the intricacies of the multi-uses and all the different special permits that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2164.897s">And</a> I wasn't exactly sure, again, especially how you detailed the uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2170.26s">And</a> then the applicant has already tried to explain them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2173.083s">But</a> it's just, in layman's terms, it's kind of hard to capture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2176.725s">So</a> this is going to be played out later. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2178.527s">At</a> this point, what the board is trying to do is just <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2183.39s">to</a> recommend it to the city council to continue this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2186.331s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2187.131s">So</a> that it can be vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2190.271s">Right.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2402.332s">Okay,</a> well, at this point, um, hearing, uh, no further, um, responses from the board, I will ask for a motion to recommend the, um, the language as is, uh, going to the city council as opposed to continue it or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2417.979s">Cause</a> that's, uh, attorney Orzman has said, this has had many iterations with the city, with, uh, the applicants attorney, as well as, um, attorney Orzman as the city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2428.083s">And</a> so we'll let it go to its next step with the city council and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2432.538s">So</a> I will ask for a motion to recommend to the city council.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3545.91s">Thank</a> you, Daniel, for explaining that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3547.61s">And</a> it just brings me back to the kind of things that I want to kind of look at here are not part of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3556.272s">And</a> so that's why I have to keep asking clarifying questions to make sure that I'm keeping myself on tap. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3562.113s">Because</a> at this point, it's like, it looks like it's well prepared with legal as well as with the city is to move forward recommended, but I'm just one board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3572.315s">And</a> so at this point, it's like, it's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3576.252s">the</a> things that I want to talk about are not, they're not, we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3581.113s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the right items going before. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3587.795s">And</a> saying that, I will ask if there's any other clarifying questions from the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3860.357s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3863.7s">If</a> there are no other board comments, I want to open it up for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3869.464s">Those</a> who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3873.115s">message</a> Amanda in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3874.695s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3880.117s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3883.658s">Amanda,</a> can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4045.788s">So</a> yes and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4047.349s">So</a> at this stage, we're doing the actual zoning and that's what we're focusing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4052.831s">But</a> should this get recommended and moved on, then the community development board has the onus of making sure that the site, we would review that at the site plan review.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4093.95s">Attorney</a> Silverstein, are you able to help us out with the language here as far as how 17 on the dimensional standards and requirements would <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4106.647s">play</a> out later?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4129.106s">No,</a> you're absolutely within rights and you have every right to have this question clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4134.811s">And</a> what I was trying to get the attorney available to us to do is to better explain what it meant as captured here versus what we would be doing in the site plan review.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4150.174s">Yes,</a> please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4194.251s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5058.541s">Um,</a> just kind of, and which one is that Danielle? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5063.224s">I'm</a> sorry that you're looking at right now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5226.645s">So</a> Alicia, and for the newer board members, I remember you laid this out for us in a meeting on June 7 and pretty much one of the uses and <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5235.118s">being</a> a special permit granting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5237.52s">I</a> know that the city feels as though it's probably easier for it to go to the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5244.904s">And</a> I don't know the position of the rest of the board at this point, but if we can just, I guess for my own purposes, I was able to talk to Danielle and Amanda earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5257.933s">If</a> you can just give a little bit more context <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5261.978s">of</a> why you probably want to keep it with community development board as a special permit granting agency.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5462.106s">Thank</a> you for reading that I do know that there was a clarifying question that was asked because the way it was presented originally just for myself anyways and it sounds like maybe another board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5471.995s">with</a> the question was that it sounded like someone was trying to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5474.817s">So</a> the way that you explained that, it's not that it was like, it sounded more like a political kind of thing where it's like, now you have these appointed members that are, um, are sort of, um, responsible for these, uh, permits case by case basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5490.348s">And</a> that's not what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5491.628s">What</a> you're saying is that you want to make it that's well-formed so that we're able to get the highest and best uses for the space on Mystic Ave as opposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5500.605s">just</a> having like a lot of parking lots and in automobiles and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5505.71s">So</a> I just want I just wanted to clarify that piece.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5610.945s">So,</a> so this is like an interim step to hold over to the zoning revisions that you also mentioned it was the city was going to hire a consultant to do a redraft so that we can be better guided going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5625.61s">And</a> I, and you said there was going to be maybe a chunk of these administrative kind of changes coming through and we should probably move. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5632.76s">fast</a> as possible, but what is the best way for them to be presented as Danielle's doing tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5638.121s">If</a> we're not voting on them, are we just going over them and then we'll, I mean, I guess I should let Danielle finish talking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5790.146s">And</a> I'm sorry I asked a lot of questions based on prior knowledge I don't know, Daniel if you were finished with your presentation or if you wanted to open it up to the board to ask questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5980.791s">Did</a> you want us to do this as an exercise along with you or separate? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5985.995s">I'm</a> trying to figure out the best way to go through.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6406.982s">So</a> we respect to the timing of this as Alicia has already pointed out and making sure that it's not convoluted to get it pushed through city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6416.447s">Assuming</a> that all board members, including myself would have to be read. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6422.923s">I</a> would have to like just read the comprehensive plan again for the use table just to see what the vision is and what we want to put there for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6430.349s">I</a> know you're well versed in what's what the city has for a vision Danielle so if you can <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6438.355s">maybe</a> point out some high level things you mentioned earlier, something about a convenience store, it's a shame that they have to have a special permit, but something else didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6446.7s">So</a> if you can give us some high level things that we can actually deliberate on, and not so much telling us exactly what we should be changing, but just give us a little bit more to like, just zoom in for the sake of time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6659.006s">That's</a> all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6660.567s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6661.427s">So</a> it is a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6663.731s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we got all of the board's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6668.114s">I</a> still do have, I believe a couple of questions, but I guess I'll table them for when you said you're gonna sort of clean this up and, cause we can't really vote on it tonight, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6729.875s">Yeah,</a> it definitely does. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6732.016s">And</a> I actually like that we have the lawyer's comments that can set us straight here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6737.901s">So</a> it keeps us straight, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6743.605s">And</a> had I known that you wanted us to do that exercise, I could have looked at the use, we could have all looked at the use table to get it done a little bit faster.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6773.555s">My</a> interest is how to sort of see what the board is feeling about being the special grant authority for <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6785.45s">as</a> presented for these changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6790.552s">And</a> I know that we don't have all members in attendance, but I guess that's one of my main questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6817.768s">It's</a> definitely this is a public hearing now, just, uh, reiterate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6871.647s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6872.227s">I</a> actually, um, I have no objections overall, but at the same time, I would definitely like to have a full board, um, and to be able to weigh in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6882.81s">Um,</a> but at the same time, I do know that they have the option to view, um, the recordings, but in order to provide, um, feedback to the planning staff.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6899.435s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6936.678s">Definitely</a> it's uh, thank you so much for reminding me of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6939.36s">So</a> based on the mullins statute, um any board member that's absent still gets its voting authority, but um, but at the same time they must attest to the fact that They have watched all statutory, um recordings or proceedings in order to participate so the absent members still get to participate but um <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6962.779s">I</a> guess, who would, would the city actually give them that option to participate with tonight, or would they just know to do that, Amanda?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7020.631s">And</a> have we, we've definitely confirmed that based on the Mullen statute, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7024.052s">Because</a> there was some nuances around the word absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7026.772s">It</a> says when a member is absent, they can still catch up and, you know, attest to the fact that they've read the statutorial proceedings, but absent meaning they would have had to have been an established board member at the time of, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7042.736s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.136s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.376s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.936s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that because <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7047.037s">It</a> couldn't be read wrong, but even another Metro resident, my husband, he read it and said, no, no, no, that's not how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7055.761s">So</a> anyways, I was just trying to make sure that we got clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7062.985s">Okay,</a> but because it is, we can continue to deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7066.646s">Does</a> any board members have any other questions before I open it up to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7076.822s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to open public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7080.523s">So</a> those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7083.825s">If</a> anyone's on or looking, message Amanda in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7088.186s">I'm</a> not sure that anyone's on for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7090.887s">But</a> Amanda, if you can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7101.671s">And</a> in saying that, again, I don't believe we have any members of the public on, but Amanda, if you can, <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7107.482s">Um,</a> see if there's any emails or letters that were sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7112.086s">Regarding</a> this item.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7135.947s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7136.227s">So</a> procedurally, I will close the public comment period and board will go back to deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7141.711s">And</a> this is, uh, uh, another chance for us to discuss, um, the proposal, which, um, or hash out any questions since it's not really anything to vote on at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7152.297s">Um,</a> if there's any adjustments or any concerns that the board may have, um, the proposed use of the use table or anything that you see that has been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7163.143s">Um,</a> again, my, my. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7166.511s">One</a> of my only, cause I, I'm not, I'm a minimal to many things, but one of my questions is, um, have any other board members weigh in, but I guess they have to do their due diligence and catching up with tonight's public meeting to be able to participate in that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7202.493s">Okay</a> so this has to get out and because it's a public meeting it has to um I am going to say we should probably obviously continue this and it has to be a date certain correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7215.542s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7215.762s">So</a> August 16th will be the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7218.864s">So</a> if I can have a motion to continue this topic actually not this topic but the petition from PDS and City Hall proposing zoning ordinance amendments <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7232.092s">to</a> August 16th, 2023 Community Development Meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7264.614s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7265.495s">I</a> thought I changed it and I did it backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7268.236s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7270.358s">No</a> worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7271.218s">My</a> most sincere apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7274.881s">Again,</a> Ari Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7277.002s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7278.783s">Pam</a> Marionski.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7281.325s">Sally</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7283.306s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7284.427s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7286.769s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7289.37s">So</a> we will continue with our next item, which <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7293.465s">Board</a> elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7296.068s">Again,</a> in the absence of two members, I'm not sure that we are prepared for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7300.552s">I</a> don't know, Amanda, if you've received any interest for the clerk or the community preservation committee representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7307.658s">I</a> do know that Ari, you are concurrently holding over in CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7314.244s">I</a> didn't know if we were restructuring or looking at that again.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7329.007s">Okay,</a> hold the post. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7333.208s">We</a> have an empty clerk seat as it stands? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7338.71s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7339.71s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7343.291s">Okay,</a> so next item, approval of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7348.62s">if</a> I can actually have a motion to approve the minutes from 6-7-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7354.284s">Actually,</a> this is a question I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7356.666s">I'm</a> not sure, Pam and Sally, if you were in attendance or if you were even part of the board on 6-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7363.13s">Amanda,</a> are they able to vote on the minutes?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7399.871s">You're</a> like, you're just you have them in your which they're voted into record, which is weird, because you can't vote statutorily on <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7408.725s">something</a> that you can watch and pretty much be a part of by watching it, but you can vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7414.667s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7435.654s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7454.49s">Yeah,</a> that was the question that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7456.83s">Not</a> so much there, again, the nuance of the word absence, not so much that they were absent from the meeting, but that they were not even <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7465.787s">a</a> part of the board at the time of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7468.649s">That's</a> for public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7471.55s">No,</a> I mean, I was just meaning, can they still vote?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7519.226s">No,</a> if you're absolutely sure that we can, we don't have to hold it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7522.348s">I'm</a> okay with vote, and I just thought maybe it's after we accepted it, and maybe Emily and Peter came back and said, oh, wait, that's not what it said. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7531.314s">How</a> do we rectify that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7533.355s">How</a> do we go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7536.858s">You</a> could amend them, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7538.419s">Oh,</a> you could amend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7539.339s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7539.72s">Well,</a> then if there's a way forward, then I don't see <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7543.173s">what</a> these are June minutes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7587.94s">So</a> at this time, I'll ask for a motion to accept the minute means from 6-7-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7592.103s">I</a> so move. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7598.799s">And</a> a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7600.68s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7601.08s">Okay,</a> we'll call Ari Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7606.543s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7607.764s">Pam</a> Marianski. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7609.625s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7610.566s">Sally</a> Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7612.447s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7613.567s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7618.01s">So</a> miscellaneous and other updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7619.851s">Does</a> the city have anything, Amanda or Daniel, do you have anything that you want to announce at this time or share?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7718.147s">I</a> want to thank all of you for being patient with me on these PDDs because they're pretty much new to the city, and I can't get my head wrapped around the fact that we're still in the zone amendment, especially with all the legalese that's going behind it and with the absence of like a city solicitor that you can just reach out and be like, okay, what's going on and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7737.175s">So</a> you guys have done an amazing job at the city staff on <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7743.725s">just</a> getting it to where it's at. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7745.325s">So</a> it's like, I'm just, I'm at that point myself as one board member, I'm ready to dive into the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7752.087s">So</a> this is, it's a little difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7753.827s">So</a> it's even more difficult to like lead the board and what we're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7757.908s">So</a> to get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7760.469s">So</a> I appreciate all of your help on that again, because I felt like a fish out of water really with the PDDs again, being new at it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7773.005s">And</a> so I know I will work with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7776.628s">So</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7779.931s">And</a> one other thing I wanted to ask, I wanted to make sure that I'm pronouncing names properly outside of getting Irie's last name proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7789.339s">Pam</a> Marianski. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7791.321s">Am</a> I saying it?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7819.041s">No,</a> it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7822.163s">Don't</a> tell my husband that, even though he's close. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7824.545s">I</a> still answer to Furtado. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7826.387s">That's</a> who I've been for nearly 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7828.869s">So</a> I forget that I'm embarrassing myself at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7839.538s">So</a> that's all I have.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7844.975s">Yes,</a> so if there's nothing else, does someone want to make a motion to adjourn?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2349.073s">Well,</a> thank you so much for the vote of confidence, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2352.974s">With</a> my technical difficulties and everything over here, I'm like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2358.315s">So</a> I guess carrying no other names, I'll do a roll call vote for Jackie McPherson for chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2368.017s">Amanda,</a> is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2370.182s">Yes,</a> yes, that sounds right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2371.623s">All</a> right, I just wanted to make sure before I pompously move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2377.527s">Emily</a> Hederman? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2380.129s">Enthusiastic,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2381.61s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2383.631s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2384.412s">Preeta</a> Cowles?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2389.155s">Ari</a> Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2390.736s">An</a> enthusiastic yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2393.138s">Pam</a> Marionski? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2395.36s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2396.5s">Sally</a> Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2397.901s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2399.342s">And</a> myself, of course, I'm Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2401.563s">I'm</a> a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2404.184s">Now,</a> if anyone, because now there's no vice chair to back me up, or as per our ordinance, would anyone like to put their hat in for the vice chair position?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2467.587s">No,</a> definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2468.107s">Thank</a> you, Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2468.768s">I</a> think you've captured well, and it's literally a backup to the chair where if David has recused the former chair, Bloomberg had to recuse himself for anything, which is maybe only once or twice that I've known that him being chair, I've had to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2485.32s">I've</a> had the opportunity or honor to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2488.082s">And</a> then obviously now with him having turned out, <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2491.803s">I</a> was able to step in and provide the chair role now, but there was no difference than being a regular board member, but just knowing in the back of your mind that, you know, he would reach out in enough time to give you that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2504.512s">So</a> it wasn't like it was a surprise or anything like that, but just being a backup.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2558.75s">So</a> that that helps facilitate these meetings, and some of the things, just just for full transparency the city has been awesome and helping to guide conversations not so much to just just given another perspective of what <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2576.138s">what</a> we should be looking at, not so much in how we're to determine anything, but so we've been getting a lot of administrative assistance from the city in that respect, which I have definitely appreciated from Danielle with the PDS going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2589.225s">So</a> you're never out on a limb, kind of just to give that background.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2602.885s">Thank</a> you so much, Emily.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2613.209s">Thank</a> you so much, Emily, for stepping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2615.85s">And</a> we are going to do a roll call for Emily, if there's no other people that want to vie for the position of vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2628.854s">So</a> roll call, Emily Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2631.786s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2633.308s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2633.628s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2634.87s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2648.703s">Thank</a> you, Emily, and welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2659.19s">So</a> now we're just going to come back to Amanda and sort of say, okay, so now we have the clerk position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2664.093s">And</a> one of the things that I've learned about the clerk position is that <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2668.136s">I</a> was asking Amanda about taking conditions as we're going through the meeting and things like that, if I'm supposed to write them, if Amanda's supposed to write them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2674.363s">And</a> I think that's something more that the city wants to lean kind of on the clerk for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2679.389s">So</a> just keeping that in mind, not to scare anyone away, but Amanda, you can go into more detail about that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2686.935s">Absolutely,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2830.304s">Thank</a> you, Emily, for articulating exactly what I was trying to articulate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3194.034s">Sorry,</a> so I was kicked out of the meeting for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3197.957s">I</a> apologize if I missed <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3200.168s">If</a> anyone, at your presentation, Amanda, of the, what it entails to be a CPA representative, I wasn't sure if anyone wanted to, if anyone had put their hat in, their name in the hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3222.236s">I'm</a> sorry, I'm not even sure if any of you can hear me, okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3238.063s">part</a> of my technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3239.605s">I'm</a> working on three different computers now, not just one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3243.23s">Oh</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3245.914s">That's</a> life. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3247.556s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3353.956s">So,</a> we're going to table for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3356.298s">So,</a> are you okay staying as CPA rep in the interim or are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3361.963s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3362.484s">So,</a> you'll stay and then we'll revisit clerk and CPA going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3367.968s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3368.589s">Amanda,</a> do you have any miscellaneous updates or announcements?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3663.96s">There</a> was one miscellaneous item that I want to discuss openly, speaking of assistance from the city and that's, and having discussions with Amanda, we were talking about the ability to have site visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3675.906s">I</a> know that sometimes when we get the materials, we have just enough time to visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3679.567s">I</a> mean, just enough time to go over them and not really enough time to visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3682.829s">And</a> Amanda has offered a solution that can pretty much help the board <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3690.097s">implement</a> or make a site visit happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3693.064s">Amanda,</a> do you want to speak on that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3865.067s">Thank</a> you for the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3866.909s">Clarifying</a> question, Alicia, as well as Amanda, following up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3870.732s">What</a> I had more in mind is like, for instance, I will get for myself, for my own interests, sometimes I will get the material and I'll say, well, I wish I had time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3878.378s">I</a> just, you know, I just did my walk on that or I just I was at the grocery store on that side and I wish I had a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3883.743s">a</a> chance to kind of see this because it'd be like some tiny nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3887.866s">But</a> that's just for my own personal preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3890.507s">And</a> so I thought maybe it could be open up to the entire board, not so much as mandatory or even a requirement, but more if you had the time and you wanted to be able to see a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3904.195s">If</a> they thought that there was a problem, someone that could not be pretty much understood on paper, if we can get enough time <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3911.055s">to</a> decide if we wanted to go out individually and see the site.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3986.879s">Mine</a> is more so like if it's a PDD and it's coming to a certain area, like we're very new at the PDD process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3993.561s">So</a> let me see where this, I wanna see it visually, off paper kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3999.664s">So</a> that's more of what I was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4001.164s">It's</a> not gonna be every single project, but just if the board wanted to see something that they had an interest in seeing on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4009.347s">That's</a> all, not everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4010.888s">I</a> think a lot of the things that we can pretty much tackle <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4016.333s">virtually,</a> but just if there was like an extra, not to burden the board more, just giving them extra help in trying to figure it out, that's all.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4405.188s">Thank</a> you for even entertaining it Amanda, I didn't want to add any extra arduous tasks onto it at the same time, just like with land use, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4412.292s">You</a> want to make sure that you're using the board's highest and best use of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4416.434s">But</a> I just know that there's just been a couple of instances that I wish I had a little bit more time to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4422.398s">And</a> so I was just opening it up for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4424.099s">And</a> I didn't mean to make that a huge thing, but... No, I think it's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4432.925s">Well,</a> thank you for the discussion, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4435.366s">At</a> this point, if there is nothing else on the agenda, if no one else has anything to add, I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4448.892s">I'll</a> second it, Pam. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4450.752s">Second</a> motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4452.693s">So</a> roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4454.254s">Emily</a> Edelman?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4471.863s">And</a> myself, Jackie McPherson, is a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4474.708s">Thank</a> you, everyone, and see you on August 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4478.354s">Thanks,</a> everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4480.818s">Good</a> night.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_K9V4Q_QDZAA/2025-06-26_K9V4Q_QDZAA.html">Community Development Board 06-21-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1797.636s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1837.929s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1841.331s">I</a> see them twice.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2112.396s">Alicia,</a> do you know what the paper trigger was for the lie?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2151.35s">I'm</a> almost positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2153.513s">I</a> can't say that I can't say that I'm positive about knowing but I'm just wondering if it's transportation which we discussed in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2161.335s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2162.115s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2162.856s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3217.3s">I</a> was on mute, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3220.622s">So</a> I live right across the street behind 61 Locust, and one of the things, as the point has said, it can be underutilized, but then there's times it's like, when it's bursting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3231.908s">And</a> now that there's the Ford Tavern there, the Ford Tavern, I thought had some kind of a, I'm not sure, the city would know this more. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3239.412s">a</a> partnership with that least parking that's right directly across the street from it and then when they're still over during the holidays from the metal glen mall that parking lot is used and if i'm not mistaken there's also a dog park there that is sometimes brings more cars so i'm just trying to figure out um <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3257.486s">I'm</a> glad that the commissioner brought up the parking issue because I'm trying to figure out where all of those cars would go, even though it's not pretty much utilized for, I don't know, 70% of the year, 30% is still a lot when you don't have parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3269.416s">So</a> I'm just trying to, in the absence of department head information from the traffic engineer, I guess I'm just,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3311.635s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3372.813s">I</a> know you didn't ask me, but thanks to that development that's on close to 61 Locust, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3380.815s">That</a> actually came with a previous development.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4177.761s">I'll</a> second.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4184.105s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4307.889s">I</a> motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4309.13s">I</a> second Emily's and Emily you second Peter's for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4314.754s">Yeah,</a> I second.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4402.681s">I'll</a> vote to approve the minutes from 520 523 5323 5323. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4405.042s">You</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4405.842s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4406.042s">Is</a> there a second for Jackie's motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4723.164s">Well,</a> I will tell you offline, I'll pick up the conversation offline but I want to thank you for meeting us, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4730.407s">That's</a> for sure, because I know even in preparation within my seat, it's it's a heavy lift and I can only imagine all that you had to do to keep up so I appreciate all done I think I can't speak for the board, but <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4743.993s">It</a> gives me angst to know that we're going to lose you in leading that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4749.057s">Because</a> I'm sure that, like myself, all of us want to see the city pull forward with these planning projects and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4755.261s">But</a> it's kind of hard, the capacity of it, the bandwidth of it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4760.505s">So</a> we are very appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4762.446s">I'm</a> very appreciative of all you've done to keep us straight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4770.851s">If</a> you didn't mention mistakes, I wouldn't know that they existed.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=808.212s">This</a> is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=810.974s">As</a> Attorney Dash has mentioned, the nonconformity increased by 2% of the lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=817.18s">That</a> really isn't a thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=818.601s">Because</a> it's an academic quad. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=820.623s">I'm</a> just, I want to make sure that we're clear here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=826.368s">I</a> don't I don't see any issues and as far as parking, because again it's academic why it does, I don't think that will increase parking is right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=887.423s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=887.643s">I</a> just wanted to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=888.564s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=888.984s">And</a> one other question that's kind of related, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=892.946s">When</a> is sociology moving to Eaton Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=894.646s">I'm</a> a Tufts alum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=896.627s">That's</a> the only other question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=911.069s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=911.749s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2039.538s">David,</a> this is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2043.944s">I</a> have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2045.285s">One,</a> it is exciting to have this new means coming in, and I can definitely see a large customer base and maybe market demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2052.314s">And</a> speaking of that, one of the things that I noticed <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2056.985s">And</a> just for the area over there in Middlesex Ave, is there, one of my first questions is, I wasn't aware that this was a grocery store previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2065.971s">I</a> thought it was always a fitness center even before crunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2069.854s">So</a> I didn't realize that it was already set up to be a grocery center. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2072.996s">So</a> I'm trying to figure out how emergency vehicles and if trucks are tight and they're loading. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2079.26s">How</a> would emergency vehicles go in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2081.262s">Then</a> my second piece to that is traffic generation trips are going to be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2086.307s">And</a> I want to know if it was standard uses or if it was actually determined at certain peak hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2092.092s">And</a> then secondly, the pedestrian set up over there is lacking on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2098.898s">So</a> I have a couple of questions surrounding safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2103.042s">And</a> if it wants to just speak a little bit more on so basically my overall questions are safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2112.857s">Access</a> for proper access for emergency vehicles and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2119.031s">traffic</a> generation, which you say, for instance, this is as we just heard from one of our residents, Miss Kim stated that it would be a demand, even I was shocked, you know, it sounds like it's a great place going to bring all kinds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2133.881s">Are</a> we prepared for this and with the proper traffic generation resource?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2375.198s">I'm</a> sorry, one of my biggest concerns is that the walkability issue over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2378.36s">My</a> dentist is actually located right next door to Crunch Fitness. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2382.563s">And</a> when I walk over there, and so what you bring it in the college, tuck, tuck, and just having other options, not all will use Ubers a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2391.568s">will</a> implement the blue bikes that the city is installing around Medford now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2396.73s">And</a> so, and I've seen that a lot, even increasing with going to BJ's across the street from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2401.191s">And</a> so I'm just a little concerned about, I literally, if I'm walking over, if I decide to leave my car at home and I'm walking over there, I'm making a run for my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2410.674s">And</a> it's like, it's a little bit more than hoping that the cars will drive, you know, safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2414.515s">And</a> I'm not putting it on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2415.535s">It's</a> just that it is bringing in more traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2418.056s">So</a> that's where my concern comes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2616.79s">I'm</a> just having a hard time envisioning it only because I know just from being in Medford itself and living across from Wegmans with that, that's a larger and it brings a lot of traffic to the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2628.554s">And</a> with H Mart being specialized, we just don't know the market base and what that traffic would bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2636.497s">So</a> I'm just not convinced that it won't be a huge significant increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2642.699s">But</a> I'll leave that to the traffic engineer.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2662.481s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2662.741s">And</a> my thoughts are anecdotal from being a neighbor, and from pretty much using all these spaces that we're referencing, and just me being over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2673.185s">So</a> I guess I'll just, I'll defer to the experts on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2675.765s">It's</a> just as a neighbor myself, or as a resident of Medford, it's just a concern.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3138.375s">especially</a> accessing the site from Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3141.756s">That's</a> one of my biggest, because again, as Christy has already mentioned, as a board, we're looking to make sure that as you're building, we're making sure that we're getting, we're making sure that there's a community benefit and you being a community neighbor, this is our opportunity to make sure that it's done well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3160.304s">And</a> not to put the stress or burden or economic burden on you, but at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3166.327s">pedestrian</a> safety should be at the top.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=4204.695s">So</a> to clarify, this is for one change or a few changes?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5163.243s">I'll</a> second.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5348.234s">I</a> wanted to speak on a July 5th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5351.034s">I</a> know that I will not be in attendance because I won't be in the states. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5357.296s">So</a> I don't know where that leaves us with quorum or anything like that.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_39QZXkKLDII/2025-06-26_39QZXkKLDII.html">Community Development Board 05-17-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2293.853s">I'm</a> sorry, before you do the roll call this is vice chair McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2297.416s">Can</a> I have a clarifying question in order to do that I thought that originally, Attorney Desmond had said that the project had to be complete first are we able to give that condition now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2334.875s">Okay,</a> I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't adding extra layers for the proponent to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2339.477s">Okay,</a> I understand.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2353.762s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3163.292s">Thank</a> you, David.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3165.513s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3165.993s">This</a> is Jackie Patato, Vice Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3167.954s">And</a> at this point, since David has already prepared us for what to be going before us, I will ask the proponent, Mr. Mavini, if you can, if you wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3180.472s">take</a> over and Amanda, if you can please give him the control so that he can share his screen with us and he can do his presentation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4465.201s">Thank</a> you so much, Mr. I appreciate you going over those very extensively with the full details. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4473.104s">At</a> this point, what I'll stop in and I'll open it up to the city staff to provide any kind of input that they may have at this at this time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4493.321s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4495.123s">Director,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4496.746s">Director</a> Hunt or Amanda, if you have anything that you want to add to this before we open it up to our board and to the public.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4576.23s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4577.511s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4578.011s">And</a> thank you, Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4580.212s">And</a> thank you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4581.333s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4582.193s">And</a> as I was, I've actually, I quickly cross-referenced myself as Mr. Vinnie was going through everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4589.177s">And</a> it seems we do have obviously a couple of new comments that came in from the city, but it seems as though the city staff, the department heads don't have much more to add either, but we'll get to that part after I open it up to the rest of the board to see if they have any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4608.498s">Does</a> any board members want to speak or provide input.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4873.772s">Do</a> we have any other questions or comments from board before we open it up for the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4887.752s">All</a> right, hearing none, I am actually going to go ahead and open up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4893.015s">And</a> so those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4898.858s">You</a> can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4903.781s">Before</a> providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4907.623s">Remind</a> all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4911.665s">to</a> provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4914.927s">If</a> a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4920.431s">So</a> I'd like to share and all the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4924.314s">Amanda,</a> I can't see the entire screen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4960.813s">At</a> this time, Amanda, I'm gonna, so I will close the public comments since you don't have, since we don't have any that are coming in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4969.819s">And</a> one of the things I wanted to just make sure is that before I proceed to the board to get us to deliberate, I want to make sure that we are in compliance with making sure that we're considering the special permit as the grant and authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4981.988s">We've</a> already looked at if there's a special, if you can guide me on if there's a special consideration besides what the department has already entered into, or have already provided to the proponent to be considered, whether it's for traffic or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4998.321s">Other</a> than that, then the board would deliberate without, the board would deliberate outside of whatever you suggest.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5073.155s">And</a> for public purposes, do you want me to read those out? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5078.062s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5078.422s">Yeah,</a> actually, it could be good just to... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5082.06s">As</a> per 94-11.62 for a special permit criteria, what we are now determining is the consideration of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5091.265s">One,</a> that social, economic, or community needs which are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5096.028s">Two,</a> traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5099.59s">Three,</a> adequacy of utilities and other public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5103.152s">Four,</a> compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5108.778s">Five,</a> impacts on the natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5111.261s">And</a> six, the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan, which we have heard from the city's director, Hunt, that it goes well with the community's needs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5141.985s">Based</a> on an update from the traffic information from Todd Blake, his overall sentiment in regards to traffic, there's this one tiny mitigation that the proponent can consider and that's just additional blue bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5157.451s">But</a> I want to bring attention to the fact that two of our conditions previously from the previous board ruling, number one and two may be outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5166.275s">So</a> that's something to look at going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5185.073s">And</a> overall, his assessment of the project hasn't changed, then his recommendations have not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5193.515s">That's</a> in regards to traffic.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5200.878s">Yes,</a> of course.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5280.953s">And</a> then in addition, one of the newest is from the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion that was not included previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5289.135s">Have</a> you looked at those requirements, those recommendations for ADA compliance?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5320.627s">Without</a> my influence, I want to say that based on what I've seen and what has been prepared here in the length of our conditions previously, if we looked at our conditions, I think it pretty much covers one through six, but I would need, I don't stand alone, and I would need the board to pretty much weigh in on what you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5347.829s">This</a> is our first one, so.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5360.927s">And</a> I guess before we actually vote on it, Amanda, are we, the onus is on us to make sure that we have all these conditions again, because we can't just rely on the previous conditions because a couple of them are outdated, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5374.831s">So</a> would we need to relist those 16 conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5378.432s">I</a> believe it was 16 conditions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5419.129s">And</a> I guess this is more of a two-part kind of thing, because we're also doing site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5423.85s">So</a> should we do that separately, or should we review the actual standards for approval for that going forward?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5500.376s">I</a> mean, determining that we're hitting on every, um, one of the, uh, the listed points.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5514.825s">So</a> basically what I'm asking the board is, do we find that one social economic community needs, which are served by the proposal and the <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5524.719s">Two,</a> do we find that the traffic flow and safety include in parking and loading? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5529.721s">Three,</a> do we find adequacy of utilities and other public services? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5533.882s">Four,</a> compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5539.405s">Five,</a> do we find impacts on the natural environment? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5542.466s">And</a> six, do we find the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan before we make recommendations? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5551.909s">Is</a> what I am asking the board.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5582.678s">I</a> think we've got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5588.865s">Thank</a> you, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5589.945s">To</a> me, the social economic community needs definitely served, obviously, because as Peter has pointed out, before it was just the parking garage that was serving cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5599.368s">Now</a> it's going to be serving people, communities, economic benefit for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5604.809s">But</a> again, I cannot stand alone on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5608.11s">Two,</a> traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading, has been determined by Todd Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5614.211s">And</a> so I'm going on the expert of the department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5617.852s">Three,</a> adequacy of utilities and public utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5620.834s">I</a> am going by, again, the determination of the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5626.297s">As</a> far as the compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5631.8s">As</a> far as scale, that's something that we can further discuss if we <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5636.842s">We</a> had board member Clay's agency has already Asked a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5642.806s">I</a> didn't have any myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5644.126s">I</a> didn't know if any of the other board members wanted to do a great on that particular point As far as impacts on a natural environment Direct director hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5657.854s">I</a> don't know if you have a specific thing for climate or resiliency there for us to do a rate on that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5664.058s">I</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5719.325s">So</a> if we can probably clean up the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5721.987s">So,</a> um, how does the board feel about the existing conditions with eliminate and one and two, um, as being obsolete, um, as per Todd Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5732.893s">And</a> then if we wanted to add any Peter, um, I know I'm, I'm.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5752.297s">General</a> sense before we do a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5753.977s">I</a> just want to get the conditions under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5756.158s">Um,</a> so that's Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5760.019s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5760.719s">Um,</a> so Amanda, that would be striking one and two from the, uh, previous conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5768.881s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5770.141s">And</a> then adding, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5772.91s">How</a> do we feel about adding the blue bike reference from public? <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5782.063s">And</a> the one thing is in number 15, I guess we would just update. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5787.822s">to</a> perform a compliance with recommendations and we would update all of the letters at this point because there are up to include updated letters as well as the brand new office of diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5801.21s">That</a> was originally included. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5802.711s">So</a> based on those conditions, if we can have a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5808.854s">grants</a> a special permit to, uh, for the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5813.079s">What</a> conditions as do we have, would we have to state them again, Amanda?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5859.128s">I</a> apologize I mentioned that and we would do the list but neglected to add it as a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5865.47s">All</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5883.695s">So</a> with that, we'll be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5885.356s">Seeing</a> no other conditions from the board or no other input, do we have a motion to grant a special permit to 200 Boston Ave for approval with conditions as stated?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6039.945s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6047.95s">The</a> one difference that I see with this is a question I was in, I'm not sure if it was covered earlier and how you were going to handle the trash removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6062.319s">And</a> that's to Mr. Avini.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6088.554s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6091.515s">And</a> we discussed exterior lighting earlier with one of the provisions that Police Anderson has already laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6100.997s">Does</a> any board members have anything else that they want to add as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6106.631s">the</a> site plan overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6126.679s">It's</a> almost like a repeat of everything that we've already gone over, and especially with all of the conditions that we've already had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6132.682s">So</a> I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend the site plan for approval for 200 Boston now.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3422.282s">I</a> wanted to echo your thanks to David for all the work that he put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3430.033s">I</a> did look over and I don't really have any objections because it just looks, I mean, all the work that was put into it, he just made it that much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3438.22s">And</a> it's very clear, the clarity of it, so much so that a couple of things stood out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3442.704s">And</a> I'm just wondering if we were to implement this, when do we start? <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3446.807s">Like</a> for instance, it was just brought to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3448.829s">Unfortunately,</a> Andre, we'll be losing you as chair at the end of your term soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3454.253s">And</a> I do know that it says going forward, there'll be one year, <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3459.685s">term</a> for chairs, but it doesn't say what the term is for vice chairs and so forth, so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3464.529s">So</a> I'm just trying to figure that out in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3467.431s">It's</a> been an honor to be a vice chair alongside you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3470.834s">But</a> I also want to make sure that we're conforming and giving other people that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3476.979s">So</a> those are the only questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3478.661s">It</a> was so good, David, that it got me thinking along those lines of just how we're going to implement it and follow.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3504.505s">No,</a> I thought that's what I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3506.246s">Maybe</a> you struck the language, but I'm almost positive I saw that within the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3512.667s">but</a> it could have been something you struck out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3566.561s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3568.144s">And</a> even with saying that, I mean, again, with getting a new chair, I'm just wondering, are we going to have like an election, a re-election for vice chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3577.893s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're going along with what is suggested.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3599.833s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3816.825s">I'll</a> make that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3821.748s">I'll</a> second it, it's Jackie.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3838.396s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4187.252s">And</a> that's everything on my end. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4191.145s">Um,</a> Andre, this is Jackie, I just wanted to clarify on that going back to the zoning map change, Amanda, are you able to give a little bit of specifics about what that zoning change would be for 200 blocks and I'm just a little, I thought that was like a shared space already, like with toughs being there and just like office space. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4209.575s">I'm</a> just wondering what that's <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4212.479s">change</a> would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4213.82s">Amanda,</a> do you want me to speak to that?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7091.486s">Yes,</a> just in response to my colleague, I will tell you that I know that over the years that there's been any number of times where parents have chosen to withdraw their child before an expulsion because they didn't want an expulsion on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7107.494s">And</a> so it's a very interesting <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7109.91s">area,</a> but that could account for some of the differences that have happened in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7116.758s">I</a> did want to thank the students who spoke out clearly tonight, and to all of the students who've been articulate during this period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7126.869s">I</a> will tell you that as the events unfolded, I did go and have conversations with key people just to make sure I felt comfortable that I knew that our staff was handling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7141.438s">And</a> I even drove by from a distance when there was a walkout on Friday, observing then the superintendent, Dr. Cushing, and many of our other administrators talking to the groups of students engaged in conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7156.787s">and</a> getting the sort of feedback which will only be more helpful to us as we go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7161.45s">So</a> I appreciate your work, and I appreciate the students coming forth and being active, because that's what it's ultimately going to take for us to improve the current climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7173.617s">It's</a> been a difficult time for everybody and we are not unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7180.427s">the</a> sort of issues that we're facing in Medford right now are being faced across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7185.908s">And</a> while that in no means makes it okay, I think it's an interesting thing to understand the dynamics of society right now and how they're affecting our kids and why it's so important that we listen to them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7306.938s">We</a> did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7309.9s">Just</a> prior to my leaving for the meeting, I checked and the only letter I had was from our student, Catherine, which you've all heard now and I sent to you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9673.628s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9674.649s">Just</a> real quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9675.991s">So</a> are students being assessed for the family report four times a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.037s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.564s">Three</a> times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9682.585s">Three,</a> yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9685.007s">Is</a> the idea that it might, for those students who haven't achieved fluency, would it ultimately go up to maybe through the third grade or is it, you know, will it grow?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9758.697s">Okay,</a> thanks.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9761.998s">Sounds</a> good, thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10965.517s">Yes,</a> just because I think it's appropriate to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10968.957s">So</a> let's take the $50,000 figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10972.778s">Given</a> our expenditures to date, is it realistic to that we will be able to cover that expense given our budget expenses so far this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10986.431s">And</a> I guess I'm asking Mr. Murphy that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11052.462s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11053.002s">So</a> I guess my question is, are our expenses running as expected, or are they widely more than we expected? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11062.528s">And</a> should we be concerned about spending a significant amount of money? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11066.89s">Now,</a> again, part of the problem is it may not be significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.452s">Maybe</a> it's $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.832s">Maybe</a> it's $12,000.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11155.881s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11156.222s">That's</a> exactly what I was hoping you'd say.<h2><a href="../2021-11-15_Hr7vlJwC1Vw/2021-11-15_Hr7vlJwC1Vw.html">11.15.2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4576.006s">Yeah,</a> so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4577.367s">I</a> think this sounds like very interesting and challenging work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4582.189s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4584.009s">First,</a> where were the engagement specialists housed in the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4588.771s">Have</a> we found offices for them all? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4591.432s">Because</a> I can't believe that wasn't a challenge.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4636.96s">That</a> was actually my second question was, you know, part of this is, is that they have to find their place within the schools, right, and to a point that Mr. Murphy made earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4647.065s">Sometimes</a> they've had to be utilized as coverage, but frankly, that sometimes is the time when you really get to see a broad view of students, and this can be very very valuable to <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4659.513s">whoever</a> works in the school so I actually think, especially at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4663.076s">That's</a> an asset, even, you know, I understand it's time consuming, but it does allow someone to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4671.184s">Now,</a> my other question is so let's suppose said person, one of your reengagement specialist is something that we as adults understand the terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4681.953s">What</a> will the kids call these individuals? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4684.314s">Where</a> do they fit in there?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4753.285s">I</a> guess, you know, I'm just thinking for the youngest kids, something like a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4757.287s">helping</a> hand or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4759.009s">Yeah,</a> you know something, something that something, even a helper I'm a helper that someplace I can just see them being in the school and trying to say, how do they define their place with the title, which is child friendly helper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4777.324s">Anyway,</a> just curious.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5573.263s">Just</a> to clarify, so the students were moved, or was this an event where the teacher came in and found the water in the?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5583.485s">After</a> the evening or weekend?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5591.087s">And</a> the students were moved?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5599.731s">And</a> then are the ceiling tile has been replaced at this point?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5606.14s">Are</a> the kids back in that original classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5608.141s">Yes,</a> they're definitely back in there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.014s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.495s">And</a> this was one classroom at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5627.757s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5630.686s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.126s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.526s">Three</a> kindergarten classrooms were affected.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5636.708s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5637.708s">So</a> one of the things which I'm just going to comment on is that I feel almost like our rules and regulations about how we address something, I think we're unfortunate in this case because we had a member of the public come up <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5658.595s">and</a> show some photos, and it says we're not supposed to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5664.641s">And</a> yet it was very clear to me that the superintendent had been down, that she knew a lot about this, that you knew a lot about this, but because it says we're not supposed to respond, that family who was sitting here <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5681.242s">walked</a> away without any answers, just, and we did what we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5685.686s">We</a> said we referred it and asked you for information today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5689.269s">To</a> me, there's a process thing, which is difficult for me, only because if we're following our rules, then we're not responding to a person with an immediate concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5700.768s">And</a> I think it doesn't speak to the strength of the administrative team who knew everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5708.455s">You</a> could have answered the questions last week with a follow-up today or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5716.061s">But</a> I find that to be, as someone who's been on the committee for a long time, a very difficult place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5720.585s">And</a> I understand we're following procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5723.688s">To</a> the end, the only thing I could think of, frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5728.917s">to</a> the superintendent is to say, please be more proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5733.439s">This</a> was a situation you knew about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5735.16s">It</a> probably should have been in your report, so we could have spoken about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5739.623s">So</a> if something like that's the thing, the only thing my sort of plea to you is to be, I think you guys did everything right, that you were on top of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5750.228s">But</a> unfortunately, when it was presented, because we were following our rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5756.255s">it</a> didn't look like you were as on top of the situation as you actually were.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5804.365s">It</a> doesn't, and it never will, because when things happen like that, it's going to be a problem for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5810.29s">But</a> on the other hand, since we did know it was going to be on the agenda, if it had been included <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5817.764s">In</a> the superintendent's remarks, we could have said, we're going to hold that until later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5823.79s">I</a> mean, frankly, I'm trying to do a workaround around our rule, which makes sense for other reasons, but is sometimes challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5833.38s">And</a> I'm not going to be here to do it, but I am saying to my committee members, this is an interesting dilemma.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5861.314s">Because</a> I guarantee you that when there's something like this particular problem, it's going to get to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5866.718s">I</a> mean, it's going to get, you know, it's not a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5869.981s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5871.242s">And</a> so, and it also leads us to just ask the question right now, is there, are we experiencing, there's always leaks?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5879.989s">Are</a> we experiencing anything else that you've got your eye on, that you're concerned about in another?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5909.124s">In</a> terms of, this seems like possibly this is a roofing issue, is that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5916.75s">Say</a> it again?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5921.689s">Is</a> this a roofing?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5972.891s">Specifically,</a> this isn't something which is going to be solved by putting on a new roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5976.914s">Is</a> this saying we need a new roof?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.943s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6309.662s">Yeah,</a> I just want to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6311.002s">In</a> fact, as I recall, as my brain fog lifts, Mia's absolutely right, my colleague, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6317.605s">Mastones,</a> because I do, in fact, remember that we fixed this problem before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6325.928s">And</a> that, you know, that's part of the problem is that we fix problems, and they happen again, and they happen again and with all good intentions that people thought that they got to the root of it the last time we had put together, if we, if we go back at least two, four years when we were doing the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6348.963s">planning</a> over what would infrastructure planning over the next couple of years, what project we would see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6355.529s">At</a> that time, the roofs were on that saying well they probably have a shelf life of another five years or so well that's back for at least four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6365.038s">years,</a> if I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6366.139s">So</a> I think that document is one that should surface again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6369.701s">It</a> does exist and that those were items of concern back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6375.984s">And</a> again, it's difficult because they're big ticket items. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6380.667s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6381.327s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6477.339s">If</a> I could go just one little part. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6478.88s">It's</a> not if a resident has an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6482.241s">It's</a> asking the administration that if something like this occurs again, where children are moved out of the classroom because of a major issue like this, that you included in the report of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6498.545s">Because</a> I think that's the easiest way to <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6501.86s">to</a> have it on the agenda.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6732.738s">I</a> just would like to ask the administration as to whether a timetable like this is doable, realistic, and what, if not, what would be realistic given the obvious desire of the committee to move the budget discussions up earlier.<h2><a href="../2021-11-08_Sog9mTxuN90/2021-11-08_Sog9mTxuN90.html">COW Meeting:  MCAS Results</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2421.39s">Excuse</a> me, I have two letters from the public that need to be included at this point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2429.5s">Sorry,</a> guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2430.722s">The</a> first one is from a citizen Justine Deutsch Myers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2437.434s">She</a> says. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2438.981s">that</a> she lives at 197 Playstead Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2442.162s">What,</a> if anything can be done, this is just what we were talking about, within the schools to increase the COVID vaccination rates in the 12 to 15 year old student group and then 16 to 19 year old students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2453.407s">According</a> to the map published by CBS Boston last week, Medford's vaccination rate of 12 to 15 year olds is just 57%, and the rate for 16 to 19 year olds is 60%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2467.972s">Have</a> there been vaccination clinics in the middle schools and MHS for students and or other initiatives to improve on these rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2475.935s">Have</a> you been collaborating or discussing strategies with other cities and towns nearby that have higher rates of vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2484.778s">Our</a> numbers are lower than neighboring cities and towns in our local region for, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2490.208s">12</a> to 15 year olds Arlington has 90% Somerville is 83% Malden has 60% Melrose 76% and Medford is down at 57% 1619 year olds again similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2504.713s">where</a> Medford trails significantly behind the other towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2508.694s">So</a> again, if you could specifically ask, have we done vaccination clinics and are there any more scheduled? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2516.937s">Are</a> they effective? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2518.057s">Would</a> be my question to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2520.898s">Have</a> you reached out? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2521.818s">Are</a> there anything else we can learn from other cities who are doing better than we are? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2527.28s">And</a> I would add just is, do incentives help at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2531.901s">I</a> mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2534.743s">Do</a> you do the, you know, win a gift card or whatever, just that help at all.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2666.031s">OK,</a> the next letter comes also from the chair.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2695.026s">Okay,</a> that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2697.036s">I</a> do think for parents it's convenient if it's right at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2699.937s">So,</a> so the second letter is from citizen Christina McCordy, and she's a 24 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2708.32s">It's</a> multiple questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2717.003s">Yep,</a> air quality checks in the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2719.964s">And</a> she said that we were told that air filters would be replaced often. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2726.185s">Can</a> we have an update on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2727.945s">If</a> the filters are not replaced often, she says the air quality cannot be guaranteed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2755.398s">She's</a> specifically asking about air filters.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2841.783s">So</a> would they just, I'm asking you, would they be changed around, say, December 1st again?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2850.925s">Quarterly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2851.305s">Maybe</a> you could just give us an update when that happens.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2884.736s">Okay,</a> second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2886.638s">School</a> staff have ongoing concerns regarding the room temperature in classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2891.661s">Warm</a> classrooms, she says, lead to more improper mask wearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2895.365s">Also,</a> when you cannot feel the AC, it is hard to know if the air is blowing, which leads to worries about airflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2902.131s">Work</a> requests have been repeatedly ignored, she says. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2905.394s">So</a> please detail what staff need to do to get these concerns addressed, and please make sure it is communicated to all staff.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3028.3s">Okay,</a> number three, many teachers or staff at our school are interested in additional your air purification. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3035.862s">The</a> PTO at our school would like to purchase box fans with more 13 filters. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3041.544s">They</a> are under $100 each but most of our classroom teachers are interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3045.826s">Can</a> we request the use of code would bend to put toward this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3050.267s">For</a> equity sake, we would like this offer to all school buildings, our PTO will also put some funds toward this is their formal process to request coded funds.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3161.11s">With</a> the air testing that we're having done now, if there was such an area, would it automatically be put in?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3172.774s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3177.495s">Fourth</a> and lastly, can we have an update on staffing issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3180.476s">Are</a> we close to returning to testing twice per week?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3236.179s">Okay,</a> I received one more letter, just just as it came in as you were speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3241.187s">It</a> says, this is from Ingrid Mercado 131 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3247.066s">Hello,</a> I'd like to comment about the idea presented by Mr. Murphy of not having a standing COVID update in the agenda every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3255.369s">My</a> concern about taking it out of the agenda is that the public wouldn't be able to have public participation during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3261.652s">I</a> think COVID topics are important and the public needs to be able to ask questions and get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3266.494s">In</a> my experience, school committee meetings are the only way to get these answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3269.695s">In</a> the past, I've sent multiple questions to administration and I haven't received answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3275.418s">She</a> notes nurses at the school level are fantastic and give us great information during our PTO meeting, but sometimes we want answers at the district level.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3795.942s">We</a> can't see it at all, Peter.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4166.309s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4167.55s">Could</a> you just clarify? <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4168.971s">So</a> the test has already been given to students K to 12?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4693.64s">Did</a> you still have a... <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4695.934s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4697.275s">So</a> it's given at the beginning of the year in October, February and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4703.38s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6918.537s">There</a> is a dress code is in the student handbooks, is at least mentioned in the student handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6928.183s">So</a> that would be a starting point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6952.424s">The</a> school committee is supposed to approve the handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6955.304s">So</a> it's just a point of that it's generally been <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6960.653s">there's</a> been discussions over the dress code for many years at many different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6967.576s">And</a> I certainly support looking at it and updating it, but it's not like it's never been discussed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6985.184s">Well,</a> the refinement is that there's always been <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6988.107s">the</a> understanding that the policy that we approved that the the handbooks and that becomes what you're saying is we don't have a separate one in our policy handbook.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=7000.996s">Well</a> we're quibbling over it but I'm just mentioning that it's in the handbook.<h2><a href="../2021-10-05_hCz5uniVUiI/2021-10-05_hCz5uniVUiI.html">October 4, 2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=791.912s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=792.753s">I</a> think I should probably read them at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=796.915s">Is</a> that all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=797.936s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=798.256s">The</a> first one is from <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=811.038s">Christina</a> McCourty 24 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=813.762s">She</a> writes dear members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=817.987s">I'm</a> the parent of two elementary school students and I'm writing with a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=822.712s">One,</a> at this point, is there any evidence that points to possible interschool spread of COVID-19? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=829.767s">Watching</a> the COVID tracker there was an increase in positive cases in a couple of buildings, and many of us are wondering if there were multiple cases in the same classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=839.335s">Do</a> you want to take this one by one or if we could.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=998.312s">This</a> parent goes on to say, is there any update on when buildings can transition back to testing twice per week? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1005.495s">She</a> mentions that she knows the kindergarten students are being tested daily and says if that's happening, she would think we could handle testing all students twice per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1015.703s">So</a> if you might.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1114.163s">The</a> third part of the email is, some first grade students have begun unmasking in class for phonics lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1121.188s">Though</a> this was briefly mentioned in an email communication, no details have been given on what this looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1127.313s">We</a> have a right to know what risks our students are taking and which health professionals weighed in on this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1133.077s">Going</a> forward, can someone from the district please give a detailed description of unmasked situations that have been deemed to be necessary for instruction? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1141.347s">before</a> they happen for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1143.729s">Any</a> unmasking brings risks, and I think families have the right to know of any increased risks they are facing at school so we can reflect on it, ask questions, and determine whether we decide if the risk is acceptable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1156.777s">Many</a> students are also anxious about being unmasked indoors, and knowing in advance would give us caretakers the ability to prepare them and discuss it in a safe place.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1237.429s">Okay,</a> I'll turn to the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1242.391s">This</a> one is Ingrid Moncada 131 virgin have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1249.336s">I</a> have a few questions regarding COVID protocols at MPS, and she writes in parentheses, a comprehensive document with MPS current policies would be ideal, so we'd have to keep asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1260.965s">One,</a> what's the data that supports the decision of testing kindergarten in such a different way than the rest of the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1268.891s">Why</a> now? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1269.431s">Was</a> there evidence of in-school transmissions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1322.767s">Okay,</a> this one touches on what you've just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1326.948s">What's</a> the criteria for quarantining a whole class? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1329.849s">Is</a> it because the whole class is considered close contact? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1332.93s">How</a> can that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1334.33s">How</a> often does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1335.85s">Is</a> it only in kindergarten classes?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1395.188s">Part</a> three, what are the guidelines for students returning to school after being sick at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1399.832s">I've</a> heard reports of people having to provide proof of coven negative and pay for a private PCR test. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1406.065s">before</a> being accepted back in school, and others that are not told anything, and just bring the kids back as soon as they feel better.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1556.218s">The</a> parent goes on to say, has the district or city considered providing free COVID testing for NPS families at schools after hours City Hall or other Medford location. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1567.088s">If</a> families are indeed required to provide proof of negative test before returning to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1571.572s">This</a> would be essential.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.042s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.622s">That's</a> all the letters that I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1706.252s">on</a> the school committee mailbox.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.394s">It</a> was very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.874s">A</a> couple questions just sort of in understanding the scope of your work in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4843.877s">you've</a> outlined three different areas, which I assume are for all K to 12 teachers?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4857.647s">All</a> K to 12 staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4858.828s">So</a> like, we don't have that much time for professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4864.572s">When</a> are you coming in and how many people are coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4867.535s">And</a> if you could just give us an understanding.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4987.03s">I</a> guess if I could go back, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.112s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.933s">So</a> as you're training the in-district, what is the scope of that work? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4995.897s">How</a> many people are you training? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4997.619s">How</a> many people are you meeting with?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5065.971s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5066.911s">Just</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5070.413s">You</a> say taught in our book, social emotional learning in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5075.294s">Are</a> those resources that are used, is that something that the school committee can take a look at?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5102.61s">So</a> we can go find it in your office, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5105.332s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5128.266s">Is</a> it available online?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5278.411s">What</a> I need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5279.472s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5595.979s">Yes,</a> I find it a little confusing, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5599.961s">Part</a> of it is the wording is presentations of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5602.942s">And</a> does the presentation mean a statement or, for instance, a letter?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5646.359s">Right</a> now, I have another letter that has been submitted to us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5660.822s">It</a> doesn't have to do with anything particular on our agenda so it wasn't a pub. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5665.088s">That's</a> why we did earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5667.21s">have</a> a public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5668.491s">Um,</a> Mayor Sorry, remember Ruseau?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5674.494s">So</a> but we've always had an opportunity for people if this person was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5680.497s">Earlier</a> in the meeting where it used to be, they would <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5693.747s">It's</a> my fear is that you're cutting out the ability of a person to ask a question, which I understand isn't necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5704.431s">Like</a> if I read this letter, I'm not expecting that there's going to be a dialogue, but the person wrote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5710.714s">And</a> I thought that we did this whole thing about having letters submitted so that people who aren't here, we could read it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5750.0s">So</a> in one hand, you're saying that the goal is to be inclusive and welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5755.864s">And</a> on the other hand, we're saying, but here's someone who's written a letter, but I can't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5762.869s">I</a> don't really understand that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5787.809s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5813.921s">But</a> this was submitted to the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5816.842s">My</a> job has been to read the letters that were submitted to the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5822.004s">This</a> person chose that way rather than writing us individually, which I actually think that there's a benefit from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5830.1s">I</a> understand that there would be no discussion about this, but to not read it, and again, I happen to know what the letter contains. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.065s">It</a> could be anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.905s">I'm</a> just making a general observation that it seems to me that we've become, with this policy, the well-intended to correct another problem is in fact causing another concern that I am articulating right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5855.823s">So</a> this person, Monica Rushford, who submitted this letter, is not going to have her letter read tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5863.009s">I</a> make a motion to read the letter.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4524.748s">Yes,</a> this letter is from Cheryl Rodriguez of 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4530.372s">She</a> writes, hello, I'm writing concerned about the lack of a permanent crossing guard at the intersection of Riverside Ave and Freedom Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4538.218s">There</a> are three schools that utilize that crosswalk, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4545.142s">I</a> am grateful that the Medford police cross children there when they can, but understandably, they need to leave it if there is a call leaving no one to cross our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4554.629s">This</a> is even more urgent as bus 11 formally dropped off at spring street and central lab was canceled for the middle school, and those children now have to walk without benefit of a crossing guard on that very busy street bus 11 was created because there were so many children on bus to that they could accommodate them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4573.153s">I</a> am unsure of how many children lost bus service with this move. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4576.614s">likely</a> inspired by the driver shortages, but the families received no notice and have added to the number of children likely unaccompanied that are crossing at the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4587.382s">Please</a> prioritize getting a crossing guard to this location immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4592.386s">Thank</a> you, Cheryl Rodriguez.<h2><a href="../2021-09-13_ZvcDJHTayW4/2021-09-13_ZvcDJHTayW4.html">Regular School Committee Meeting 9.13.2021</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2601.438s">What</a> are we doing to support that students academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2606.4s">You</a> know, I understand we have our limits, but it seems like now you know they're out for five days they're out for seven days, what if it's a second grader, what do we do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2789.417s">I</a> think, obviously, you would understand my concern for a student who's come back to school and then all of a sudden is out and might be out again a few weeks later and a few weeks later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2800.002s">So</a> anyway, I think that, you know, I know we've brought in some support people, I think we sometimes may need more, maybe as tutors for students who are out and so I <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2811.928s">This</a> is something that I think we need to very closely monitor, and I'm most concerned about.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2903.981s">I</a> have other questions but I'll yield to my colleagues, they can get an opportunity.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3393.448s">Yes,</a> I just want to say I'm really glad that the high school testing is being revamped because that was one of my concerns after our visitation so that's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3403.658s">The</a> other question I was just curious about is whether it may be too soon, but I'd like to know if what percentage of our, and I'll ask it as high school students but of our high school students are vaccinated do we know at this point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3741.454s">Yes,</a> just to follow up on member credits question, we had received a letter from a parent expressing concern that there were at least three kids in the bathroom when her daughter walked in periodically so you know I know I know it's tough to monitor at all but you know, I just wanted to your attention yeah the high school.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3773.615s">Okay,</a> I think we might have all gotten it, but I'll make sure I forward it on to you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3919.746s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3926.256s">Thank</a> you, I read the document that member Ruseau provided to us in detail, and as a former representative to with shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3934.868s">I</a> am very familiar with shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3938.132s">And</a> in fact, remember, Hank Owen, the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3943.403s">of</a> many years, very rightly, is a wonderful wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3949.67s">The</a> question that came to me is that this is basically calling for a fund to be put aside for capital improvements for sure, which makes a great deal of sense, but I didn't see anything addressing <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3964.506s">the</a> potential for, if by any chance, something should happen to the shore such that it would cease to exist, what would happen of the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3976.852s">And</a> so there was no, I didn't see any line item which suggested that it would be split back between the districts or anything else like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3984.975s">And</a> while it is perhaps far-fetched to believe something will happen after the successful run of shore, it seemed to me that some <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3993.459s">some</a> notation should be made about what would happen to that account in the future if it was not used.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4064.206s">Well,</a> my suggestion is that simply that should be added to this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4070.828s">And</a> again, I'm happy to refer it to your attorney as to whether that needs to be or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4078.171s">But</a> that was my one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4080.711s">Otherwise,</a> I would make a motion to support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.533s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.693s">Motion.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4101.052s">Should</a> it be a roll call?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4103.274s">I</a> think it should be a roll call as regards to finances.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4121.403s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4297.759s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4298.539s">Member</a> van de Kloet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4299.88s">I</a> was asked to inquire about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4301.941s">So</a> the original date that employees were supposed to give you documentation was September 8th, and then it was put off to the 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4311.285s">Could</a> you explain why that happened?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4379.443s">I</a> think that perhaps the interpretation might have been by some people that it was, oh, people aren't getting their stuff in, so we're giving them extra time, and they're dragging their feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4388.686s">So</a> I wanted to make it clear that, in fact, we are having great cooperation with our labor units.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4434.2s">Right,</a> well I think we're all very thankful to our labor units and I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the agreements that were set forth around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4447.024s">Would</a> you say around the mandatory coven 19 testing and proof of vaccination requirements.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=5357.165s">Okay,</a> member McLaughlin is next.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6055.463s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6057.805s">While</a> we're under the topic of transportation, it would seem we received a letter from a member of the public, which would be appropriate to read at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6066.9s">Please,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6068.12s">So</a> community member Eleanor Klein wrote us to the school committee account regarding bicycle racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6078.063s">And</a> she wrote that she wants to draw our attention to the bike racks at the middle and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6086.645s">She</a> included some photos of the bike racks, which she says the racks are outdated models <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6093.187s">and</a> unusable and difficult to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6095.749s">In</a> addition, they represent a very small percentage of available space dedicated to students alternative non-fossil fuel dependent transportation options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6105.958s">She</a> says she knows that the ones at the high school are frequently filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6110.081s">I'm</a> sure the bike commission CC here can be valuable resource for ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6114.967s">With</a> the partnership connector she writes the opportunities for middle schoolers to bike to school safely will be expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6121.212s">In</a> addition, we as a city need to work on ways to encourage more cycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6125.216s">I</a> would love it if we could start by making sure an ample quantity of usable racks are installed at our middle and high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6132.982s">Is</a> there a plan or discussion around bike racks currently in our budget transportation planning? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6137.525s">If</a> not, please make sure that this is added to the mix. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6140.467s">Thanks</a> very much, Ellery Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6143.248s">And</a> I do want to note that Dr. Cushing did respond and is willing to further the conversation and work with whomever he can to make this happen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6855.935s">We're</a> allowed one delegate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6857.856s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6858.236s">Excuse</a> me, Mayor.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6861.124s">Yes,</a> we need to nominate our voting delegate in an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6866.786s">And</a> every school committee member is welcome to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6871.567s">This</a> is just the particular voting portion of the resolutions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6879.15s">Yeah,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6914.584s">And</a> I'll still go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6915.344s">I</a> just don't want to be the delegate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7208.259s">Yes,</a> so I certainly would support this but I do want to let you know that it isn't the first time that it's been discussed that when we in fact built the new schools there were discussions about accommodating left handed students at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7223.017s">It</a> came up again over a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7226.62s">It's</a> one of those things that it's just always good, though, to check on whether they're in the right place at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7233.185s">And</a> do we need more just because of the particular population? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7237.408s">And</a> of course, some of the deaths have bit the dust, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7240.811s">So</a> we might be replacing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7243.833s">We</a> might have, I don't know, with right-handed deaths rather than left-handed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7248.777s">So</a> I support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7253.214s">I</a> think that it's appropriate for us so since there is an expenditure potentially for us to get a report back so that we understand what we're asking for in terms of if we have an additional purchase.<h2><a href="../2021-06-24_cu8VAJw3V-Y/2021-06-24_cu8VAJw3V-Y.html">Special Meeting of the Medford School Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=380.709s">So</a> looking at the, I don't know whether <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=384.925s">Mr.</a> Rousseau who tabulated the responses wants to say anything at this point, but looking it over, I see that my colleagues hold you in the same high esteem that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=396.547s">Because</a> as I look over the different scores, all of which are often 3.5 or above with four being the highest, you can see that's truly a remarkable standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=411.611s">And</a> so that, <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=413.933s">I</a> think that we all value so much what you set out this year, your achievement in getting kids back to school, holding the safety of our students to the highest level. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=429.345s">And</a> I think you should be really proud of yourself.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=958.656s">So</a> no more the week of June 27th?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1057.591s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1058.472s">So</a> I think that what we're thinking, but if we could just look and determine when we think the special meeting would be, what is the latest that the city council can give us the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1075.205s">It's</a> usually, I know it has to be done by the 30th, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1079.966s">Their</a> last Tuesday meeting is the 29th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1083.307s">So</a> does that mean that we are going to, our special meeting will be held on the 30th? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1090.089s">Just</a> in case, I mean, if they have to, if they go all the way to the 29th to confirm the budget, then it would suggest that our special meeting would be on the 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1102.99s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1105.252s">I</a> really need to set the date so I know what, you know, if we do it the previous week, we might not yet have the budget from the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1115.223s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1118.747s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1119.748s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1120.108s">So</a> therefore, I make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1122.397s">that</a> the special meeting be held on Wednesday, June 30th? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1125.798s">Is</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1126.778s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1127.139s">Superintendent,</a> is that a date?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1139.703s">Do</a> we think that the city council might be done sooner so we could do it on Monday the 28th?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1241.904s">The</a> truth of the matter is we never had a final approval meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1244.727s">What</a> happened was we submitted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1247.049s">We</a> always understood that the city council has never declined the amount that we submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1255.516s">So</a> this is something new that we're doing this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1261.885s">You</a> know, it's difficult because if they go all the way to the end, you know, we can't really, if they haven't voted the budget, how can we accept it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1275.318s">This</a> really is a question I think Mr. Murphy might have to weigh into since he was the one who suggested, because otherwise I'd say let's do the meeting on Monday the 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1282.844s">Right,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1284.026s">Which</a> would be far, far preferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1287.941s">And</a> if you go to July 1st, it's the beginning of the 4th of July weekend.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1310.519s">And</a> yeah, so once we get that, I would actually suggest otherwise that we look at Monday the 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1316.783s">So</a> let's put a hold on Monday the 28th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1376.814s">Yeah,</a> I'd have to do a leader's time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1440.511s">I</a> did want to read, I thought I saw him here earlier, so I thought he might chime in, but I do want to read a letter that we received for the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1451.537s">Dear</a> members of the school committee, I'm writing to express my utmost appreciation and support for Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1458.661s">The</a> courage and grace that she has displayed over the past year is truly remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1463.023s">The</a> city is blessed to have her leading our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1466.125s">I</a> am sure that the members of this committee feel the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1468.915s">I</a> look forward to many more years with Dr. Edouard-Vincent at the helm. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1472.316s">Respectfully,</a> Sean M. Began, Esquire, Zero Governors Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1478.198s">Wonderful.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1479.939s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1484.421s">Motion</a> to adjourn.<h2><a href="../2021-06-15_5r8Hhmlpsmo/2021-06-15_5r8Hhmlpsmo.html">Regular School Committee Meeting June 14, 2021</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=920.336s">Hey,</a> Tony, you wrote this article. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=923.597s">It's</a> for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=924.698s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=926.378s">It's</a> been quite a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=927.699s">I</a> work with Tony and Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=929.259s">I</a> followed her in one of the schools, and I followed her here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=932.381s">And</a> I'm so glad I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=935.022s">We</a> just appreciate all you've done for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=937.182s">You're</a> always there to answer the phone and guide us through all the complex problems we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=943.965s">We</a> really appreciate everything, Tony. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=946.426s">We're</a> going to miss you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=959.369s">Thank</a> you for guiding us through a pandemic relentlessly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1088.824s">Kathy</a> and I have the honor to present to you from the House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1094.146s">Be</a> it hereby known to all, the Massachusetts House of Representatives offers its sincerest congratulations to Toni Wray in recognition of your years of dedicated and outstanding service to the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1107.611s">The</a> entire membership extends its very best wishes and expresses the hope for future good fortune and continued success in all endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1115.453s">Given</a> this 14th day of June, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1118.105s">2021</a> Robert Leo Sean garbled a Christine Barber and Paul Donato Tony, I just want to take a second to say in addition to these words, you have just been invaluable. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1128.925s">It</a> is so wonderful to see your entire team here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1132.127s">And</a> I'd like to express our thanks to every one of you as well, because that's what Tony would want. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1139.051s">So</a> Tony, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1140.232s">Thank</a> you so, so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1141.492s">Thank</a> you for all of your work up to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1144.154s">And</a> then thank you for getting us through the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1146.795s">Tony</a> worked tirelessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1149.157s">She</a> worked on weekends around the clock to make sure that our students and teachers were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1158.769s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1981.569s">We</a> took a roll call.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2027.798s">Before</a> we do that, after that, as we're taking things out of order, I would ask that we move on to the presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2035.329s">of</a> the advisory committee.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2065.836s">Mayor,</a> I am happy to stay here to get to the entire agenda, no matter how late we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2072.12s">But</a> in the meantime, we have an audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2074.622s">And</a> we know why they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2075.722s">We</a> have an advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2077.043s">We</a> know why that we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2078.424s">We've</a> already asked them graciously, not really asked, but <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2081.886s">They</a> graciously sat here for our wonderful presentation to Toni Wray. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2086.689s">We</a> wanna take up our seventh graders and that I think it's only appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2090.512s">I</a> guarantee you to my colleague, we will get to everything on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2096.076s">No</a> one's gonna rush out of here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2665.663s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2666.304s">The</a> only thing is, I wondered whether we should specify one, because if there's one or more, or because sometimes if you're putting in one, putting in a second one might not be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2677.29s">So</a> I don't want to limit it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2702.353s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3189.052s">So</a> this is our rubric, and it was used by our committee to evaluate the names of the submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3197.235s">The</a> rubric outlined three different criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3201.223s">the</a> potential for the name to bring the community together, two, the potential for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and three, the potential for the name to represent Medford community's proud history. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3216.45s">Each</a> one of the criteria had a scoring range from one to four, four being the highest a name could receive in any category, and one being the lowest score that a name should have received. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3229.585s">Thus,</a> the top score of any one suggestion that they could receive is a 12, and any name with a 12 would be significant to multiple historically marginalized groups and not polarizing, known for exceptional deeds, community involvement, or contribution to society with a historical notable legacy that would last decades, or if it wasn't a person, it would still have historical significance that would last decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3255.599s">And</a> lastly, if it was a person, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3258.7s">They</a> would have lived in Medford with a Medford specific reputation, or if it was not a person, it would have a long standing ties to Medford with a positive history.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3272.866s">Our</a> public participation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3275.541s">After</a> all of the names were scored, the top scoring 15 names were to move on with the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3282.989s">However,</a> due to a tie, we ended up with a top 17 names to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3287.553s">And</a> then after looking at the list, we realized we had accidentally removed a name that should have been considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3292.999s">So</a> we therefore added that name on to continue with the process, leaving us with 18 names to present to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3301.037s">On</a> May 11th, the committee adopted and formalized a process of how we should receive public input on those 18 names as outlined in a resolution brought forward by Heinrich Ginnies. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3312.428s">And</a> a subcommittee was established to create the public input form. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3316.472s">And</a> the survey was open for one week to collect written responses for or against any of the 18 names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3323.527s">The</a> survey itself was translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Portuguese. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3329.271s">There</a> were hard copies also made available at Medford City Hall and the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3334.834s">And</a> overall, the committee received over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3346.582s">The</a> top 18 names were also independently researched and rescored by each of the committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3352.867s">via</a> the process previously described by the rubric, all 23 members of the advisory committee did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3360.055s">The</a> scores were then collected, averaged, and ranked as one point for the committee members to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3366.683s">The</a> committee then moved forward to reduce the finalists down to the <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3374.176s">Using</a> an adopted process as outlined and brought forth by Patrick McCabe, the committee started with a list of names in alphabetical order, and if a committee member had stated that that name was their top three, that name would remain in consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3389.567s">If</a> no one on the committee said they would include that name in their top three, that name was stricken from the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3395.771s">This</a> reduced the official list down from 18 to 13 names, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3400.069s">And</a> next, every committee member was given up to three minutes to advocate for which nominee or nominees they thought should be sent forward to the school committee based on their own research, the rubric and public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3413.493s">Each</a> committee member voted for one of the nominees. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3419.094s">And</a> after the first round of votes were recorded, only three of the candidates had received a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3424.275s">And</a> a motion put forth by Paul Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3427.474s">was</a> made that we should just accept those three and send them forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3431.596s">And</a> that was adopted and the three names that received votes were on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3441.079s">And</a> so our first few names that, these three names were Missituk, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3450.182s">The</a> first of the three names here for you tonight is Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3454.939s">The</a> land that the city of Medford sits on was inhabited by the Massachusetts tribe and other Native Americans for thousands of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3463.541s">The</a> indigenous people that lived on the land called the river Missituk, which means Great Tidal River. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3469.582s">As</a> English colonists came to the area, the name of the river was altered in a more familiar English word, Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3478.663s">The</a> river has been very important throughout the history of Medford, and it was used for fishing and for water by the indigenous tribe, and then by the colonists, and it also became essential for trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3491.428s">It</a> became a subject of poems, such as, Over the River and Through the Wood, and Paul Revere's Ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3497.651s">This</a> river has been a source of community pride for centuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3505.254s">The</a> Missituk River, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3506.767s">as</a> previously mentioned, has been bringing people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3510.189s">It</a> was a source of the food and water for indigenous tribes and the first colonists. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3514.832s">It</a> then became a place that allowed Medford to take part in trade industry, being a port and preparing goods to ship out and even building ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3524.019s">The</a> city of Medford grew because of the Mistook River. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3528.322s">And</a> today, the river is used for walking, hiking, boating, fishing, and other various community events. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3536.032s">There</a> is a widespread effort underway to continue to work to restore the river and the land surrounding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3541.796s">And</a> by using the Native American name, Misutuk, we are taking time to honor those who had originally inhabited these lands and taking a step to acknowledge the past and as we do this, stepping into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3558.527s">These</a> are just three responses that we received from the community input survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3564.704s">There</a> were so many wonderful responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3567.025s">And</a> even though that this was not a vote, all of these responses were used and considered and provided the committee wonderful information into getting us to these final three names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3582.933s">These</a> three quotes here really exemplified why Missittook is a positive influence, not only for the city and for the students of the school, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3593.629s">but</a> also for the rest of the children in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3597.471s">Some</a> of the feedback expressed that it was a reflection of the river and how the river has been a focal point for our community for centuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3606.816s">People</a> also shared that it acknowledged the native people for who originally inhabited this land. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3613.439s">And</a> it also provided a physical connection between our past and our present. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3618.642s">It</a> was also shared that people liked it because it wasn't a single person. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3623.561s">but</a> rather it celebrated a shared space and an aspect of a physical environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3631.247s">And</a> lastly, Missittook represents Medford's proud history. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3636.751s">As</a> previously mentioned, the Missittook has been here long before Medford has even existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3644.457s">The</a> Missittook watershed was home to the indigenous people of Massachusetts prior to colonization of the area by the Europeans. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3652.554s">The</a> name may have morphed into Mystic, but it does not diminish the role or the value of the Missitook River and what it has played in building Medford by providing resources of not only food, but also trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3666.483s">The</a> river powered tide mills that allowed for the process of corn, tobacco, textiles, and wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3673.768s">It</a> was the home of the first bridge over the river, allowing the city to play a key part in the founding of this nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3681.653s">The</a> river is also the subject of well-known poems and stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3686.297s">And</a> while the river may now be known as Mystic, the name Mistituk gives nod to those who came before us, honoring them and acknowledging their language and homelands. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3697.566s">It's</a> a

href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8856.156s">That's</a> 254 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8858.978s">Jennifer</a> Yanko. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8864.341s">I</a> support the change of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8867.502s">and</a> does not specify which of the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8871.064s">Jessica</a> Farrell. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8874.885s">My</a> preference among the names is the one the student survey showed most support for, Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8881.268s">Monica</a> Rushford of 44 West Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8884.009s">I</a> urge you to adopt a new inclusive positive name, anti-racist name at tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8889.651s">The</a> time is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8891.652s">Christine,</a> sorry, Wendy Cliggett. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8896.838s">of</a> 7 West Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8902.322s">This</a> is a longer one. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8907.004s">It</a> is my hope that the school committee will choose the name Mistah, the Native American word for the Mystic River, meaning the great tidal river. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8914.269s">It</a> is the backbone of Medford and what binds us as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8918.732s">People</a> originally settled here because of the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8920.853s">Over</a> the years, it was misused, polluted, and neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8923.495s">Many</a> did not <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8924.639s">realized</a> that the river was polluted due to its beauty and seemingly healthy flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8929.663s">Raw</a> sewage was expelled into the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8936.788s">And</a> she goes on speaking about the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8939.33s">Mrs.</a> Tuck reminds us of those who came before us and our obligation to respect our city's lifeblood and our planet. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8946.675s">It</a> would be naming the school for our river is symbolic of the common bonds that flow through our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8957.088s">That</a> was Wendy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8958.73s">Then</a> this is Christina McGuarty. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8964.315s">Thank</a> you for continuing to work toward getting a new name for the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8970.821s">The</a> children at CES voted, and Misato came in first, Belinda Sutton second, and Jean Barrett came in third. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8977.687s">I</a> think it's important that everyone knows how they voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8982.099s">Many</a> adults have made this issue so divisive over the last year and they see the names as choosing sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8987.122s">I</a> think we owe it to the kids to take their thoughts into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8990.404s">I</a> also think Mr. Tuck best addresses the request of many of the teachers at the Columbus Elementary School to have a name that wasn't in honor of an individual and to not make anyone feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9004.631s">Lisa</a> Hodson, I live on Lyman Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9008.554s">Oh,</a> she spoke, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9012.763s">Jen</a> Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9015.725s">Oh,</a> sorry, that was about the, she supports the electric car charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9022.511s">Ingrid</a> Moncada. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9028.576s">Has</a> her kids in the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9030.418s">I</a> feel very grateful that the name is going to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9035.267s">When</a> I listened to the letter that the Columbus teachers wrote to the committee, I found myself in complete agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9039.91s">In</a> the letter, they point out that renaming the school with the name of a place rather than a person is a more neutral option. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9046.175s">Therefore,</a> I'm writing in support of the name, Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9051.699s">Jen</a> Zawadsas, 20 Corrine Road, that's Z-A-W-A-D-Z-K-A-S, sorry for the mispronunciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9063.381s">I</a> would like to end my voice to support Mr. Orr Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9068.424s">Scott</a> Sitaki, 131 Budget Ave, Burgett Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9078.089s">Please</a> note that how many people talk in favor of the name tonight's student effective results, community participation is not a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9088.674s">We</a> just received <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9091.092s">And</a> the last one that I have right now is from Jack McGoldrick, father of third grader, Ethan McGoldrick of the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9099.897s">I</a> hear the children of the school have chosen either the name Missituk in honor of the Native American tribe or Belinda Sutton in honor of the woman who helped initiate an end to slavery in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9112.244s">I</a> think those are great names and I stand behind the children's choices 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9115.005s">Please</a> add my vote alongside theirs.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9926.261s">30</a> seconds.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9994.452s">Oh,</a> wait, I now have two more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9996.773s">Okay,</a> I'm going to let Mr. Puccio.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10423.911s">Okay,</a> so I received two more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10427.313s">One</a> was from Michelle Chiccolo and she had sent the school committee actually a letter earlier about reaching out to the Mass Center for Native American Awareness just to get a clarification about the using of indigenous names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10445.565s">As</a> we heard clarified before, that has to do with using names for sports teams and they would, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10453.024s">would</a> not see the are using of Misita in a negative light. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10458.066s">So</a> just a clarification there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10460.047s">And</a> then we had Jeremy Raeland from Brewster Road and a parent of a second grader at a Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10465.269s">I</a> agree with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10466.25s">Let's</a> show how the democratic process works and go with the name they chose, Misita. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10472.413s">Thank</a> you, member VanderKloof.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10697.087s">Can</a> I make a motion, Mayor?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10701.11s">Can</a> I make a motion that we each state our first choice as a straw poll to see where we all are right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10709.515s">Mia,</a> I would rather, I would like to be able to make a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10714.579s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10715.179s">If</a> you want to change your motion that we each make a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10718.001s">You</a> can make a statement if you'd like to make a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10721.223s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10721.703s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10723.464s">Point</a> of clarification, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10725.986s">Is</a> public comment complete now? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10731.569s">I</a> just want to be clear about whether the public can continue to participate or if they cannot.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10752.317s">There's</a> a member here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11269.571s">Are</a> we closing public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11272.333s">I</a> don't want to speak until we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11273.935s">Okay,</a> nobody. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11275.816s">Is</a> there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11277.398s">I</a> make a motion to close public participation at this time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11305.446s">I'll</a> turn it over to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11307.087s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11308.588s">So</a> I'm going to address several things as I speak tonight, things that really need to be talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11314.772s">I</a> want to tell you that I really haven't felt this nervous coming to a school committee meeting, and that makes me incredibly sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11322.837s">This</a> whole divisiveness in our community makes me incredibly <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11327.984s">sad.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11329.345s">And</a> it's been really, really tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11331.526s">But</a> I looked out here and I felt better when I came in because I said, oh, wait, why was I nervous? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11336.289s">These</a> are, I know these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11337.65s">These</a> are my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11338.391s">These</a> are my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11339.571s">These</a> are the person who walks down my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11341.853s">I</a> know these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11343.374s">But</a> yet sometimes during the course of this evening, I've not been feeling very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11348.217s">I</a> know you mean to support each other by the calls and cat calls and whatever, but that's not what we're about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11355.66s">What</a> we are about is that we've got three great names before us and we're making a very difficult change for some. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11363.305s">And</a> that for me is extremely important because I have to be true to myself and people, there will be, no matter what I do, there will be people who are going to be unhappy with my decision or my colleagues' decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11376.052s">I</a> ask you, by the way, don't, after I speak, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11379.164s">Don't</a> clap or catcall and don't do the same for them either. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11382.846s">Let</a> us have an intelligent discussion now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11385.247s">You</a> may disagree with us, but I have to tell you, everyone is coming here after giving so much thought and so much pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11397.532s">I</a> listened to, after when we brought out this discussion, one of the biggest things that <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11404.454s">that</a> is motivating me for my discussion is hearing some of the portion of our community who felt disenfranchised by our removing the name Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11417.646s">I</a> voted to remove the name Columbus because I thought it was the right thing to do, but I heard pain in people speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11426.134s">And</a> I very much recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11428.035s">and</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11429.098s">By</a> the way, before I go on, I do want to call out to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11433.611s">I</a> thank you and appreciate the work that you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11436.61s">did</a> we know how incredibly difficult we were going to put you into a particular circumstance? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11442.414s">I</a> didn't agree with all of you of what you said when I got to watch pieces of it, but I certainly understood and appreciated the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11449.699s">And</a> frankly, I felt kind of sorry for you at times when you got to the wordsmithing part. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11455.023s">And</a> then the other part that was very amusing was when you were talking about the school committee, it was this bunch of overs, what were we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11460.987s">So</a> I just mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11463.329s">But</a> anyway, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11467.253s">My</a> long-term here on the school committee means that there were names who were on the list who didn't make it in to even that list of whatever it was, 17 or 18 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11478.939s">Tony</a> Lucci, my God, what a guy he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11482.321s">He</a> owned the sports store. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11484.001s">He</a> loved kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11485.502s">He</a> gave every kid, if they needed some free shoes or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11489.624s">Now</a> we have recognized Tony. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11491.685s">We</a> put his name up on the corner, but he's a guy who was terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11496.324s">Miriam</a> Morrissey, another fabulous educator, a person in our community, sister of Amelia Earhart, but someone who really stayed and worked in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11507.629s">I</a> didn't get to meet Alphonse Fresa, but he was the editor of the Medford Mercury, and they used to call him Mr. Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11516.872s">If</a> we were doing this years ago, his name would have been at the top of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11521.554s">Ray</a> Murano was superintendent of schools, and there were others. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11526.092s">You</a> know, part of the interesting thing about this is what we remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11530.415s">Where</a> are we calling? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11531.956s">Now,</a> I have an advantage over some of my committee members because I knew Jean Barry Sutherland personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11539.12s">I</a> knew her well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11541.021s">And</a> so I have that advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11544.724s">When</a> I think about the others and people have said, do the right thing, but of course, do the right thing means something different to each one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11550.808s">So</a> it's like, do the right thing, do the right thing, but we're interpreting that in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11555.216s">For</a> me, I'm being true to what I've said and true to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11560.159s">I</a> think Belinda Sutton's story is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11563.201s">And</a> I want to celebrate her in Medford, not at the Royal House, but someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11569.265s">I</a> don't have authority to name other things in the city, but maybe when we look, the Belinda Sutton community room at the new library, the Belinda Sutton something, I think that we can, what we have learned about her in this process is extraordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11585.376s">And</a> there's appreciation from everybody of saying, yeah, wow, I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11589.358s">By</a> the way, our kids do get to go to the royal house in fifth grade, and they do learn about Belinda Sutton at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11596.182s">Just</a> wanted you to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11597.523s">They</a> do, it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11599.344s">So</a> maybe they don't remember it, but it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11603.727s">Missituk,</a> I also totally appreciate the name and the origin. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11608.29s">I</a> walk next to the Mystic River every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11612.092s">As</a> I look at that, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11614.4s">The</a> biggest concern for me is in fact, the students who had the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11619.244s">Mr.</a> Tuck got 107 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11621.406s">Jean</a> Barry got 84. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11623.008s">Belinda</a> Sutton got 86. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11625.43s">So</a> if I look at 84 and 86, that's 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11627.292s">So</a> then there is, you know, it was a three-way vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11630.695s">It</a> wasn't a two-way vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11632.016s">Now,</a> of course, democratically, if it's, you know, whoever gets the highest vote, I am stuck with that because I wonder if Jean Barry would be saying, go with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11639.863s">And</a> that's my only problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11641.872s">But</a> I knew Jean Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11643.353s">I</a> knew her when she was selected to represent Medford in Nobioka, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11649.318s">That</a> was an incredible honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11651.22s">Two</a> educators were going off to represent Medford in our sister city of Japan. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11656.604s">And</a> for years, we also had students who were selected, the highest students who got to go and visit Nobioka, our sister city, and in return, they came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11667.533s">Jean</a> was the first one who got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11669.494s">It</a> was fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11671.315s">I</a> knew Jean when she was a teacher at the Dane, and I knew Jean when she welcomed me into the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11678.62s">And</a> she said, as she looked around her classroom, her school, as she toured me, and she said, look at this, isn't this great? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11688.467s">Look</a> how many students we have from all different countries and all different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11695.472s">Jean</a> Barry always had a smile across her face. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11699.154s">She</a> was inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11701.343s">She</a> was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11704.724s">You</a> can't really say a bad thing about Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11706.824s">Someone</a> said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11709.685s">I'm</a> lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11710.205s">I</a> knew her. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11712.326s">I</a> wish everybody knew her. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11715.107s">She</a> has been at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11717.207s">There</a> is a tribute to Jean Barry at the school and has been since her death with the sign saying Jean Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11728.569s">That</a> happened because she was so valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11731.011s">And</a> when she died, man, it was awfully hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11734.073s">I</a> remember how many people were crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11736.594s">It</a> was such a loss in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11739.456s">So</a> I'm gonna support, that would be my first choice, would be Jean Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11744.499s">I</a> don't want you to clap or anything else like that because you agree with me, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11749.782s">Unfortunately,</a> sometimes in here, there's a feeling that it's been divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11756.161s">Jean</a> Barry was an educator. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11757.822s">As</a> I pick an educator as a member of the school committee, I am upholding every educator that we have had in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11764.885s">Every</a> teacher, every principal, every superintendent, everybody who has committed themselves to education, to me, we can look and we can say to the kids, education is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11776.536s">that</a> this community recognizes an educator on the name of one of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11781.861s">That</a> is the perspective that I come from and that I bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11786.205s">I</a> think that the other names are fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11788.648s">I</a> hope we utilize them in our community in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11794.233s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11796.035s">I</a> take exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11798.24s">to</a> the person and the commentary that has happened that has said this school committee didn't function about our education. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11805.909s">We</a> only worried about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11808.032s">I</a> need to say this to you as someone who has been on the school committee for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11813.538s">This</a> school committee worked hard <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11816.361s">This</a> school committee, yes, we had this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11819.363s">It</a> was at the right time and we could debate that till we were blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11823.124s">We</a> don't need to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11824.565s">But</a> what we do need to let you know is in the month of March, this school committee had 23 meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11831.539s">Earlier,</a> when we started out, we took Toni Wray, our nurse, and we held her up because she's been such an incredible force. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11839.761s">This</a> school committee, our administrative people, our school committee members, we're not looking for your praise, but to sit here and hear you say you didn't care about our kids is simply wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11852.024s">And</a> if I don't say it, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11853.965s">okay,</a> I cannot live with the feeling of just sort of sitting here and nodding my head and saying, oh, yeah, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11859.727s">That</a> was true. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11860.587s">That</a> wasn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11861.628s">We</a> worked damn hard.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12314.615s">I</a> guess I'm just, I wasn't sure of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12317.097s">If</a> we're all making a statement, is that a straw poll? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12320.059s">If</a> you don't want to make a statement, we can do a roll call, but you just need a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12324.381s">Well,</a> probably just saying a name probably doesn't give people an understanding of where I was coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12329.745s">So</a> like everyone else, this has been a challenging year, and I'm glad we're here tonight to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12338.691s">They</a> are three great names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12341.337s">saw</a> Lewin Topper at our son's baseball game the other day and we had a conversation about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12347.579s">You</a> might remember that a few months back the school was originally or the school was originally in the mystic a few months back I made a motion to just let's return to the name of the original school <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12357.623s">that</a> did not move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12359.604s">I</a> still think Mystic made the most sense, but now we're at this point and I do think the Mississippi Tech makes the most sense that it is something that is all-encompassing because it is more about geography and that the students are all very supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12380.932s">And</a> I do want to say I did not know <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12386.539s">Unfortunately,</a> I did not know Miss Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12389.14s">I</a> didn't have the opportunity and hearing her sister speak made me wish I had the opportunity to meet her. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12396.902s">And</a> I appreciate her husband being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12399.503s">And</a> I, my heart goes out to them for someone who's, you've lost someone so young, but I do want to say that I think for the community moving forward, I think the river is something that is, that is connected to all of us here and that <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12418.665s">I</a> wasn't going to share this story because you never know how people take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12424.17s">My</a> father <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12427.056s">He</a> grew up in Ireland, but always driving up Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12429.517s">I</a> grew up at 350 Fulton Street, and my father always going up the hill, he would say, you know, Mia, long before us, there were Native Americans who walked up Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12438.203s">It</a> wasn't called Fulton Street, obviously, but to Wright's Pond, and that's where they got their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12442.366s">And</a> as a kid, it never really registered with me that there were people here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12447.029s">And</a> now it kind of came full circle for me that this is an opportunity to recognize the Native Americans and the tribes that were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12455.526s">before</a> us, long before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12457.247s">So</a> I appreciate all the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12459.707s">I've</a> had a lot of great conversations, a lot of great email exchanges. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12463.088s">And</a> I, I feel like I do have a piece about us that we are moving forward in that we can all work together to make Medford inclusive and welcoming for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12475.892s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.433s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.713s">Member</a> Mustone.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12621.714s">The</a> appropriate way to do it, Mayor, would be to have us each state, I mean, like, that's the name probably that we would go for. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12631.001s">I</a> did receive another, I was distracted only because I saw another letter came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12636.005s">But</a> we closed...
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12637.586s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12638.526s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12700.937s">Jean</a> Barry Sutherland.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12777.135s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12957.506s">Can</a> I make a friendly amendment if...
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14186.617s">You</a> know, who are working and then all of a sudden now there's another I mean, you know, so part of me is saying, it seems like would also be incumbent on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14195.843s">And</a> we might have to speak to Megan fiddler carry about this to also be able to provide some sort of daycare options on those unusual holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14205.75s">We're</a> not a majority of the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14207.847s">you</a> know, like let's Christmas, people are going to be off, but all of a sudden I'm concerned about these, especially when they're floating holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14216.89s">Um,</a> so I, I think that has to be now foremost on our mind if we adopt this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14223.532s">Um,</a> so anyway, just my thoughts.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14308.863s">Mayor,</a> but you see, one of the other things I have a concern about is if we're and you know, I absolutely understand why we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14318.791s">But</a> if we're elongating the school year, then all of a sudden we're elongating because we're also going to observe Juneteenth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14327.698s">And</a> so there's the potential then that <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14330.916s">you</a> know, because we've elongated now, like this year, it doesn't matter because school is over before Juneteenth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14337.477s">So,</a> you know, it's just, I can't help but be concerned because I know in the years when all of a sudden, and Kathy mentioned school finished, you know, the 28th or 29th, it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14349.78s">And</a> so that's my biggest concern with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14354.061s">Again,</a> I didn't look, you say that you've worked it out for, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14361.297s">21,</a> 22, 22, 23, which? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14362.037s">This</a> won't start until 22, 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14366.661s">And</a> it worked out that year okay?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14983.107s">we</a> used to call community participation and say, I just want to bring to your notice that there's a movie night at the Columbus and we'd like you to come.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15022.525s">But</a> that's, you know, I think that's actually newer because we used to do community participation and someone could get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15030.187s">Now,</a> they were always supposed to, the old rule was you were always supposed to inform the, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15038.876s">superintendent's</a> office on the Wednesday before. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15041.419s">But</a> frankly, that often is difficult for people who just want to get up and say, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15048.186s">know</a> so so here um every any presentation that someone wants to do will go through the superintendent's office right is what you're saying for which is a current policy we don't follow people can speak on a community item but they can't get up in community participation and just say anything um <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15070.492s">I</a> mean, sometimes what we always used to just sort of, but the person would say to a committee member, um, uh, I want to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15078.555s">And</a> usually, um, then we would ask the chair, whether we could, whether it was permissible mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.037s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.757s">So</a> you don't want to do that at all.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15139.78s">But</a> I guess what I'm trying to do, Paul, is I appreciate what you're trying to say is it's the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15146.636s">I'm</a> also trying to, and part of this is conjecture, trying to say, hey, how are we being realistic because somebody like the PAC would like to come forward and say, hey, we've got a PAC meeting on next Wednesday and we'd really like you to attend.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15172.578s">In</a> her report, okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15175.861s">I</a> may be trying to, it's late and I may be trying to come up with too many.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15277.789s">May</a> I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15279.51s">Did</a> you, when passed our attorney, the section on appealing and authority determination,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15295.6s">The</a> superintendent may seek advice from the district council about whether to proceed with the following appeals process. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15301.542s">Should</a> the council determine that a presentation cannot proceed, the presenter will be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15306.705s">The</a> appeal will be placed in the next scheduled regular meeting of the school committee under the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15310.607s">So</a> I just want to know, usually I would have run something like that by Howard.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15323.321s">So</a> I'd like to amend the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15325.485s">Is</a> there a motion for approval on this?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16327.67s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16329.592s">Member</a> van der Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16331.733s">I</a> don't understand the, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16334.198s">where,</a> how the flexibility of the meeting and the superintendent can start the meeting at different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16339.823s">I</a> truly just think that makes it more complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16342.446s">I</a> think that, um, I think we were trying to come up with a standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16348.311s">We</a> start at 6 30 when it's a regular school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16351.895s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16354.649s">So</a> I'm a little mystified how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16358.812s">I'm</a> also mystified because the report of the superintendent, that's the funny part, because for me, that's always like, to me, that's been, okay, that's the most important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16367.199s">That's</a> the meat of the, that's, you know, so it's funny to me, the presentations of public, the resolutions, you know, I'm a little mystified. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16381.549s">It</a> might work and I'm just not seeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16386.727s">Oh,</a> the other thing is at the consent agenda, I think, but I'm not sure, but I'm gonna ask Mr. Murphy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16394.009s">I</a> thought that if it had to do with finances, like the approval of payrolls or the approval of bills, those two things have to be roll call votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16405.551s">Is</a> that correct or not?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16415.774s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16416.514s">So</a> you'll roll call vote it all as a group?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16423.536s">And</a> it'll include all of those things?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16428.737s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16430.658s">Can</a> we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16433.739s">Again,</a> I just don't know, because we've always done those things separately.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16492.796s">But</a> if someone gives us a donation and it's financial, we have to do a roll call vote.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16505.599s">We've</a> just always done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16506.999s">And</a> I was told we had to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16508.319s">Now,</a> whether that's true or not, I don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16527.374s">Okay,</a> so you would say this paragraph, consent agenda, and including the approval of payrolls and the approval of bills, that's all okay?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16543.575s">I</a> don't think we have anything that says no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16557.34s">Can</a> this and our start time of 6.30 work together?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16566.342s">I'm</a> asking the committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16568.203s">I'm</a> asking the committee members.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16584.015s">No,</a> I'm saying that we have, that we start the roll call for attendance of members at 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16589.459s">Oh,</a> okay, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16591.9s">And</a> the consent agenda, and that's done all before, and the report of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16596.944s">But</a> again, to me, that those things can all proceed at 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16603.845s">So,</a> and the only thing that you want to make sure that we don't start before seven is the presentations of the public.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16614.073s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16645.682s">All</a> I want to understand is what time is the meeting going to start?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17022.761s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17027.664s">She</a> stepped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17029.125s">She</a> stepped out for a second.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17036.23s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17038.061s">So</a> it was six in the affirmative and one stepped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17044.965s">Superintendent,</a> now it's time for your report, please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17065.737s">Sure,</a> community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17069.138s">Any</a> citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17078.322s">A</a> community participation portion of the agenda will be established which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee to be heard on any item. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17088.766s">Any</a> item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17092.988s">by</a> the Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17099.493s">Public</a> participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17108.999s">Those</a> submitting must include the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17111.941s">One,</a> your name and last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17113.222s">Two,</a> your Medford street address. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17114.823s">Three,</a> your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17117.338s">Now,</a> number eight, number one, superintendent's updates and comments.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18314.004s">I</a> make a motion that we do it on Thursday, June 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18320.566s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18321.966s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18572.637s">Point</a> of clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18577.24s">Does</a> this include then both breakfast and lunch?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18581.283s">And</a> what is the approximate cost that we should anticipate?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18641.001s">But</a> is it so so Paul, obviously, this is a good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18646.681s">good</a> thing that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18648.742s">I</a> think it's incumbent on us to understand what the cost and impact will be.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18674.316s">So</a> we have a, look, nobody wants to vote against this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18681.441s">Nobody</a> does. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18682.622s">I</a> certainly think it's in with my purview to ask a question about what is the financial impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18688.927s">I</a> need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18690.508s">We</a> need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18694.391s">And</a> so the question is if we're going to move on this, because we've done some other things in our budget, all things that we want to keep, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18702.681s">You</a> know, obviously, if there's ESSER funding for next year, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18708.023s">I</a> don't know whether, you know, would this come under ESSER funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18713.985s">May</a> I ask Mr. Murphy if he would know the answer to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18721.928s">You</a> can say no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19078.631s">Yeah,</a> did anybody say motion to approve?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19082.353s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19208.097s">So</a> the question is, if we vote for this, it just says we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19217.926s">And</a> I'm asking, but what's the impact? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19225.72s">I</a> mean, I don't want to vote against this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19228.202s">It's</a> the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19229.083s">On</a> the other hand, we do have some families who can afford it, but I understand what you're saying, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19235.348s">So</a> there's already three members listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19240.493s">So,</a> you know, just call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19248.46s">I'm</a> not used to voting on something which I don't understand how we're going to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19259.238s">So</a> when we have that meeting next week on the 24th, which is a budget meeting, can we have a report back on this so we know how we're going to fund it? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19268.961s">Because</a> what I'm thinking is we've just shown that we're going to be $700,000 approximately, shorter of what we requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19280.645s">And</a> now this is potentially another, shall I say, $750,000.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19502.556s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19505.918s">So</a> with that explanation, I think it's okay to pass this resolution.<h2><a href="../2021-06-07_tZVXN6zzUHw/2021-06-07_tZVXN6zzUHw.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3216.871s">It's</a> red, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3218.693s">If</a> it's red, then yep, you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3220.194s">Okay,</a> so I received three emails regarding the start time of our school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3229.263s">They</a> were from Eunice Brown of 48 Greenleaf Ave., Rick Orlando from 13 Winford Way, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3238.852s">and</a> Ron and Janice Martinetti of 126 Lincoln Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3245.016s">Each</a> of the writers asked us to start to resume the original 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3249.939s">start</a> date. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3251.76s">Mayor,</a> is it allowable for me to just condense these or do I need to read <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3258.026s">I</a> think if they all are the same subject matter, you can give us a general outline. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3262.329s">So</a> the request on all of them is to resume the original 7 PM start date for all our school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3269.235s">And</a> part of this is that now that we're back to chambers for people who want to come up in person, it's easier for people to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3280.144s">Eunice</a> Brown also asked that any subcommittee meetings also <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3285.153s">start</a> at this time when a regular meeting does not occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3289.855s">So</a> if one was before a meeting, I think that it sounds like she understands that would be at a different time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3296.218s">Anyway,</a> the people spoke to the fact that they want to be able to participate and that the earlier start times makes it difficult for them to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3310.245s">So</a> that is a summation of those three letters.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3321.249s">Can</a> I speak to this for a moment?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3329.913s">I</a> just wanted to explain for people why we also are trying to be deferential to the people who, for employees as well, many of them who start very early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.178s">But</a> I didn't speak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.978s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3349.164s">Excuse</a> me, I'm so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3350.766s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3352.707s">No,</a> actually, okay, she said that she did get an answer from administration, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3357.832s">Dr.</a> Edwards-Vinson.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4760.27s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4761.731s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4763.171s">I</a> too would like to just add my thanks and appreciation for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4767.433s">It's</a> so exciting each year to get to see what projects the kids are going to take on and it's just so fabulous for our district and just a sense that we're on the cutting edge with this and really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4782.858s">I</a> would like to ask the superintendent if you would <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4785.605s">make</a> sure that a letter goes out from the school committee thanking the Cummings Foundation for their extremely generous gift to the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4792.771s">Thank</a> you guys.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5419.52s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6017.799s">And</a> Mayor, I just also want to congratulate and thank our dynamic duo team, Tanya and Alex for their incredible energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6029.401s">I</a> really, when I get to attend the meetings, you're great. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6034.862s">Thank</a> you so much for all the work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6038.683s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8523.243s">Member</a> Van de Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8524.54s">Yes,</a> I just want to add my word. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8526.441s">This</a> is clearly a very comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8529.023s">As</a> we were, as you were presenting it, I was looking at all the different things that we've talked about this evening and in our other meetings and sort of thinking about which buckets they would go into. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8540.411s">It's</a> not that some of those things haven't been already been doing, but the laying it out and saying this is our direction certainly makes it very clear to everybody.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10168.448s">Thank</a> you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10169.749s">That</a> was very, very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10172.21s">And</a> I'm sure that you've, since you've worked in different districts and whatever, and you must be familiar with some of the software that's out there for what you're suggesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10185.037s">Do,</a> can you give us an idea of what, when you say, yes, it's expensive, are we talking 500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10191.601s">Are</a> we talking, you know, what ballpark? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10195.783s">Because</a> this clearly is, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10197.35s">not</a> only the school side, but the city side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10200.652s">And</a> I know you don't want to be pegged to a number, but, you know, I'm not sure that I know what your big is or your expensive is. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10208.716s">Just</a> trying to get an idea.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10213.119s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10312.529s">current</a> practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10313.47s">And</a> have you shared with perhaps Mr. Murphy what some of those biggest players are that you would suggest we look at?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12130.898s">If</a> you could just give us some specifics, how many members of the team are you envisioning at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12141.306s">So</a> Megan, and then how many?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12270.506s">So</a> tonight, are you asking us to approve the concept without a dollar amount attached?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12334.759s">So</a> I make a motion that we move forward with the family engagement <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12342.898s">proposals.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13047.63s">So</a> right now, we are expecting the advisory committee to present on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13053.815s">And</a> I thought we were then going to vote after their presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13061.621s">If</a> they don't come to completion of their, I mean, I think it depends what, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13070.507s">message</a> we send back. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13072.008s">If</a> we're saying to them on Monday, we're going to, we'd like you to present whatever you've got, whatever, whatever, however, whatever slideshow they have, wherever they're at, you know, or, or, or we could be more direct and say, we don't need a 30 minute presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13094.325s">We</a> need, you know, I mean, we want to make sure that there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13099.917s">one</a> or two slides about each name, not necessarily eight slides about one and none about the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13107.158s">So</a> I do think that the direction back to the committee is yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13114.58s">We're</a> extending it to June 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13117.641s">We</a> expect on the 14th that we will hear your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13123.262s">Please</a> at your meetings now go forward with the intent of having at least <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13129.678s">you</a> know, a slide about each name, not eight slides about each name, but a slide, you know, something.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13154.148s">Well,</a> that's more the only that, that given that there's limited time, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13160.133s">And</a> we'd like a fair amount of slides per. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13162.435s">Right,</a> to give us a concise presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13164.536s">And</a> that if, I mean, if they need to set up their meeting so that they're going to speak, you know, half an hour on this name, half an hour on this name, and, you know, provide structure to them so that they don't get bogged down on the slide.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13273.277s">I</a> support this very much because as the person now who's charged with reading the letters or the commentary, the question always is, do I have to read word for word? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13284.005s">What</a> if there's inappropriate language? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13286.447s">What</a> if there is, you know, three letters as there was tonight all on the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13292.251s">It's</a> difficult to understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13296.054s">So</a> I appreciate that we might develop some guidelines for this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13384.386s">May,</a> just to give a back story. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13387.127s">So</a> we received a $30,000 recycling grant and as part of the grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13391.247s">It</a> has to be a school committee approved recycling policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13394.188s">So</a> that is a standard policy for the Department of Environmental Protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13397.169s">And</a> I look forward to all supporting it.<h2><a href="../2021-06-01_qmMnmAGIsyk/2021-06-01_qmMnmAGIsyk.html">June 1, 2021 Final Budget Hearing</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2750.128s">So,</a> Mr. Murphy, you and I spent considerable time today discussing the issue that my colleague brought up at the top of this meeting with the transportation for the high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2762.172s">And</a> really what we come down to, if I'm clear on it, is that no final decision has been made except that you are working towards the fact that the school committee wants to provide transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2772.569s">One</a> thing I thought about after our discussion was whether students would still be able to buy bus passes if they were so inclined.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2821.544s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2822.225s">And</a> just to follow up, during the course of the discussion, I expressed great concern that the Eastern bus projection that we would be able to go down a bus was a terrific surprise to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2838.073s">Now,</a> it is true that we have less students currently than we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2842.315s">It</a> is unclear exactly how many students will be returning to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2846.997s">But</a> that is, I just, I think that we need to keep what our budgeting generous in this area because I believe, I just know from the past that all of a sudden we have requests from the woodwork and it's very, very difficult to take back something that you've given before. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2865.761s">So</a> that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2867.402s">On</a> the bright side, I do wanna mention that there were so many things in this budget which are positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2872.803s">For</a> instance, I'll just pick a small one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2875.764s">In</a> the world languages, we are going to introduce French in the sixth grade level and textbooks for that have been provided for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2884.865s">There's</a> also textbooks in the science area, and I didn't go through all of them, but I don't want members of the public to think that there aren't, in fact, major upgrades in many, many areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2899.341s">On</a> the other hand, there are some areas which I am a little concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2903.504s">I'm</a> gonna go back to my fine arts where earlier I had asked many questions about this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2908.569s">I</a> had been advocating strongly for a supervisor, a director position of fine arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2916.315s">After</a> a discussion with the superintendent, it's clear that she's not yet ready to move on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2922.78s">And</a> while I understand that in some ways, in other ways, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2926.958s">I</a> still feel that the area is so critical in that social emotional well-being of life area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2935.93s">So</a> we aren't doing that right now, but I've certainly made it clear that my concerns in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2942.939s">We'll</a> be watching that very carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2945.381s">However,</a> given that that isn't happening, I was a little surprised not to see some of the smaller requests increase inventory of instruments, including ukuleles. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2956.49s">I</a> had asked about the number of violins, being that we're going to be starting both <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2961.315s">potentially</a> two grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2964.017s">And</a> some of those things I don't see funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2967.48s">So</a> I wanted to ask about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2969.482s">And</a> I also wanted to question, I assume that some of the other things that we talked about for science, I mean, excuse me, for summer enrichment programs are under the TBD sort because that's gonna come from ESSER funding?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2985.891s">Okay,</a> could you go back and talk about the smaller bylines and fine arts at them?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3147.074s">I</a> see there is a line item restoration of supplies and transportation lines to provide for resumption of normal event participation post pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3155.138s">So</a> I assume that one perhaps is about transportation for the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3163.582s">So</a> that one is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3164.742s">I</a> guess one of the things is when I talk about and you mentioned ukuleles, but there's also <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3170.445s">part</a> of my real concern was the violin and the orchestra program, that while they're small numbers, and I certainly understand you can say, yes, they'll be covered in the course, that there were some of these that are, you know, really germane to the enjoyment of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3189.533s">And</a> I think that enjoyment and going to school is, you know, a very important piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3194.335s">So</a> that's why I mentioned them, kind of like the chocolate chips and the pancake.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3253.712s">Now,</a> one last, just building on a previous issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3258.547s">It</a> does under, for example, in the mathematics department, it does set aside 35K in, it says, for a week-long, four-hour-a-day math academy, which we had spoken about, certainly, in the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3277.138s">It</a> says COVID mitigation priority, so I'm assuming, again, that means ESSER funds?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3283.242s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3395.827s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3396.787s">And</a> thanks for all the work you've done on the budget, as well as Michelle and the rest of the team.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5096.757s">Yes,</a> the school committee received a letter this week from some of our CCSR students asking about our user fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5105.781s">And</a> this has been something that over the years we've sought to reduce user fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5111.643s">Now,</a> it's a fairly substantial number. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5114.444s">And</a> perhaps, Mr. Murphy, do you know how much user fees bring in or approximately?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5134.079s">So</a> anyway, this is certainly another concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5137.14s">I</a> know that we have taken great pains to make sure that students who could not afford user fees were in fact waived, yet the students are bringing it before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5150.524s">So</a> I realized that at this point now we've set our budget number. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5155.805s">We're</a> also clearing that there's going to be some level of, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5161.087s">change</a> yet in the budget as they normally are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5163.429s">I</a> think it is something that we should take up again at a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5168.992s">I</a> certainly know that for years and years and years, the ideal thought would be that we would waive all user fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5176.317s">But</a> it's always been a budget impact, just the way the transportation is and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5180.119s">So</a> if we can look at it in the future, and again, the students spoke up, I would certainly like to <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5188.803s">hear</a> more from their concerns, because I guess in many ways, I was thinking that we were meeting the needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5197.565s">If</a> we're not, we need to know that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5205.886s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5206.687s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we accept the budget and put it forward to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.388s">For</a> $68,221,865, Mia? <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.728s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5218.939s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5287.604s">Tomorrow</a> night, yay.<h2><a href="../2021-05-26_j0mqfzXKqXM/2021-05-26_j0mqfzXKqXM.html">Building & Grounds Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=262.812s">And</a> earlier, it'd be okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=977.429s">Kathy?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=980.472s">Well,</a> first I just want to say thank you for the great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=984.315s">It's</a> great to see all of the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=986.918s">I'm</a> particularly excited I have to say I think that that new house and you know the what you've talked about with the kids being able to learn how to do the kitchen. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=995.985s">and</a> how to, you know, cut into the drywall, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=999.889s">It's</a> just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1001.05s">So</a> really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1002.211s">I</a> can't wait to see it in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1004.673s">And</a> the outside of the house of the school looks, by the vocational interest, looks so much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1012.34s">So</a> thank you for, thanks for all you do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1481.53s">Can</a> I ask a question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1484.793s">And</a> of course my phone's ringing at this point, but my question is, I've just seen the phenomenal work that our students are doing at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1495.442s">And</a> I'm wondering whether there's a way for this project, designing a sign, whether it makes any sense to, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1506.251s">to</a> ask Chad, and I don't know if Chad's still on, you know, is there between our different shops, is this something that, you know, a sign, I know there might be a timeline, so if the desire is expediency, maybe it takes too long, but I just wondered
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1545.433s">From</a> the lighting perspective or from the installation? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1551.535s">I'm</a> curious what part of the project was the most challenging to you, Chad?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1593.712s">Yes,</a> yes, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1595.633s">Do</a> you wanna, like, I guess one of the questions is kind of getting a sense from the committee what we think, you mentioned the mayor like number one and four, is it possible to put them up right now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1671.658s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1760.745s">I</a> don't like the white background in the middle.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1836.084s">And</a> then it says home of the Mustangs on it underneath.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1879.429s">Not</a> lighted, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1881.649s">But</a> we could shine a light on them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1904.215s">I</a> don't know on this one, the things that I think it's, you've got the horse in two different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1910.837s">I</a> like the Mustang pride over the door, but maybe if, I mean, if we're gonna use this rendition of the horse, then maybe I would do the etching on the window, but have one of the plainer signs over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1926.181s">I</a> mean, I don't understand why we would repeat the horse twice.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1978.685s">Yeah,</a> so I'm not wild about this new logo. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1982.328s">What</a> I do like, I like, depending, the home of the Mustang's right over the door is, you know, I prefer we stay with our old logo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2033.386s">So</a> I disagree with you, Paul, if I may, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.009s">Cathy?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.729s">Yes,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2038.27s">Van</a> de Kool, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2039.711s">I</a> mean, if we were to reconsider naming the high school at some point, that would be when we did a very large project, if we were going to ever go that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2049.978s">I</a> think for this one, the idea was simply to get a sign on at the front signage as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2057.844s">We</a> see, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2061.42s">Involving</a> the whole community to make a decision about whether they like this sign or that sign to me is similar to sort of involving the whole community and whether we want this paint or that paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2074.13s">I</a> think this is in our purview that we can suggest, you know, we might want to involve all our colleagues or the mayor, whatever, or, you know, but to go further than that, I mean, I don't think this is a community issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2086.734s">I</a> think this is coming up with a good design and getting it up over the door.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2111.898s">So</a> Paul, we're not renaming the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2114.139s">We're</a> putting a sign with the high school's name on it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2127.206s">I</a> think we could also say that's a can of worms too.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2160.249s">So</a> the question will be the cost of what we got as bids surprises me that it's so expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2170.273s">And</a> I think that's the issue is to say, hey, we like this kind of, this is kind of what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2175.935s">How</a> can we do it in a less expensive way? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2180.517s">Can</a> it be done in a less expensive way? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2183.592s">I</a> mean, I look at the letter on the vocational school, and I think it looks pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2192.006s">How</a> is that done?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2574.217s">Which</a> one's that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2577.506s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2599.722s">Can</a> you do one, two, and three again, Kathy?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2618.938s">Okay,</a> wait a minute, where's three?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2740.738s">On</a> this one, we can only vote for one, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3042.184s">So</a> the thing about this then is that it's not showing the blue and white colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3046.965s">It's</a> showing the blue and the color of the school.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3314.462s">What</a> is the sign made out of?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3405.53s">I</a> think at the same time, I think it's worthwhile having a little bit more of a chat, maybe with construction, I mean with carpentry and electrical. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3418.995s">To</a> me, this is the kind of project we can, what letters were done on the vocational school <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3425.597s">So</a> I think both, I think, Peter, I think it's a great idea to involve the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3430.558s">I</a> think that doing some pictures around the school saying, which one do you like, you know, and it would be fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3436.72s">I</a> know it's late in the year, but I think that would really be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3441.581s">And</a> I think if there is, you know, a way to see if there's any idea more about how to create the sign without spending that much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3571.822s">There</a> is a question about timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3574.683s">And</a> I'm not sure we're clear about what the timing should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3581.246s">Do</a> we want it in place so it's there for the opening of school in September? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3586.768s">Or</a> is it more important to cut costs, include the student body, et cetera? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3599.228s">So,</a> so far what I'm hearing is we want to do a little more exploration and we're not ready to give an okay to a 20,000 plus sign.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3686.915s">Yes,</a> and with the pricing, the pricing may be just the manufacturing of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3692.356s">I</a> don't know if it included installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3694.317s">And</a> then the other question is if it included the electrical work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3699.238s">So</a> I don't think it did, but I'm not certain.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3712.501s">You</a> know, this is where we really need a company to step up and make a donation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3752.462s">OK,</a> Kathy, I think it's 6.04 now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3827.833s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3838.161s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4515.172s">Peter,</a> that's a sweet idea.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4524.379s">I'd</a> like to have us have a horticultural program, but that's a topic for another meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5440.233s">No,</a> what do we need now to proceed on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5443.114s">What's</a> our next step?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5890.505s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6167.795s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6171.638s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6458.884s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E/2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=100.805s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=104.428s">Anybody</a> wanna skip the meeting and go out for a drink? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=111.994s">Oh,</a> there's Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=113.135s">Man,</a> that got a smile from a lot of you, so I think I'm onto something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=119.68s">It's</a> only Monday, too.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1059.217s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1061.478s">So</a> the meeting was on 510, present was myself, Paul Rousseau, attended in place of Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1071.301s">Jenny</a> Graham was present. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1073.002s">Also</a> present was Rachel Perry, Peter Cushing, Suzanne Galussi, Bernardette Riccadeli, Lisa Evangelistic, Joan Bowen, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Christina Lee, Medford Community Media, Bill Giglio, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1087.712s">and</a> Maureen Lavin. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1090.514s">Rachel</a> Puri discussed health education. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1094.177s">She</a> gave us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1096.479s">She</a> mentioned that Medford is aligned to national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1100.422s">DESE</a> is editing the 1999 frameworks and will put it out for public opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1106.627s">So</a> because of that, that's why we're right now aligning to the national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1111.751s">We</a> use the Michigan model based K to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1115.474s">We</a> spoke about this <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1117.286s">at</a> some length later in the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1121.63s">In</a> the elementary, social-emotional is taught by classroom teachers, which begins in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1129.636s">In</a> third grade, discussions about bullying education begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1134.681s">And</a> in fifth grade, we have introduction to puberty given by the nursing department using a Proctor and Gamble curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1149.113s">There</a> are pre and post tests provided to assess student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1153.577s">In</a> middle school, the students have half a year of health and half a year in guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1159.982s">Then</a> we talked about some detail about the curriculum in each of the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1167.028s">And</a> again, that there are pre and post assignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1170.07s">At</a> high school health, it's taught by health teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1172.932s">Again,</a> it's half a year of health, half a year of physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1177.159s">Freshman</a> year is introduction to health, sophomore year is healthy decision making, junior year is healthy lifestyles, and senior year is transition to adulthood. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1192.615s">Mr.</a> Rousseau asked whether gender identity was covered in grade six to eight, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1198.999s">Perry</a> answered that it was covered briefly in grade six. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1202.201s">National</a> guidelines on sexuality and gender identity just changed and we're adapting to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1212.307s">Mr.</a> Rousseau followed, said that he was concerned it wasn't presented until senior year, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1217.39s">Perry</a> assured us that it's also presented during the freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1221.818s">We</a> also talked about the right language for consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1224.84s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1225.22s">Perry</a> said that the students are taught appropriate touch guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1235.565s">Mr.</a> Russo said, do we ever talk about sex in a positive way? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.247s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.567s">Perry</a> said that the age of consent is 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1242.929s">So</a> we talk about abstinence to adhere to that guideline. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1250.882s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1251.083s">Graham</a> questions about the Michigan model and spoke about her concern that a consumer product video is used to introduce puberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1264.335s">And</a> there was quite a bit of discussion about this and seeing the hopos that we could see whether there is a better film or introduction that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1277.335s">And</a> so that's sort of on the table to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1282.746s">In</a> physical education, in each of the grades, really introduction to basic skills and concepts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1290.512s">One</a> of the things that we talked about the most is what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1298.118s">We</a> need to hire a middle school health teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1302.001s">We</a> need an adaptive PE teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1305.524s">We</a> need to provide professional development for sex education. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1311.03s">And</a> we need to provide professional development for adaptive physical education for the entire physical education staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1326.138s">We</a> did talk more about the adaptive PE and asked how we're meeting the needs of all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.536s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.736s">Perry</a> said that some students say sub-separate, some go into full class, and we're looking into using something called the flash curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.764s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.944s">Graham</a> followed and asked more questions about the Michigan model, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1355.286s">Perry</a> assured us that it's a skills-based model. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1358.008s">And</a> I remembered from our, when we, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1364.195s">used</a> it when we approved it, there was a great deal of discussion about it at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1374.1s">Dr.</a> Marice Edouard-Vincent said the Michigan model is definitely one of the most respected skills-based models. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1381.523s">We</a> do need to pay attention to the national standards until DESE updates theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1386.217s">Girls</a> are hitting puberty at younger ages, especially children of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1390.279s">Research</a> tells us that we need to emphasize healthy eating. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1395.661s">Anyway,</a> it was a good evening, and many of the things that we talked about in terms of needs, we've picked up in our budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1403.465s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1818.864s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1820.644s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2085.644s">Yes,</a> so Mayor, we did receive a letter from Mr. Giglio in regards to the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2093.991s">We</a> could take it up <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2096.107s">later</a> in the agenda when we speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2099.108s">Or</a> do you want to hear it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2101.288s">Whatever</a> you think is appropriate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2112.051s">OK,</a> if we perhaps did it at the forefront of that, it would be helpful.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3425.41s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3427.141s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Schools & Community Relations, COB 22152. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3431.143s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Schools & Community Relations, COB 22152.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3597.193s">Okay,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3598.034s">I</a> was just curious.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5972.686s">Yes,</a> I'd just like to thank both of our principals as well as those who presented last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5977.887s">It's</a> just so great to see some of the creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5980.948s">The</a> desks that look like cars with the shields just absolutely just got it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5989.51s">So</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5990.49s">I</a> mean, there were so many different ideas and creative thinking in those. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5995.751s">You</a> know, when we're talking sometimes about the issues, it's hard to, you know, understand exactly what's happening in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6003.534s">Then</a> you see that and it's just knocks your socks off. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6005.855s">So</a> thank you so much to both of you and to all of our principals who've worked so hard this year and to our entire staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.218s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.638s">Kay?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6552.681s">Mayor,</a> are we ready to conclude? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6555.452s">Yes,</a> I did get a letter regarding the whole Columbus issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6563.555s">I</a> didn't read it at the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6568.917s">This</a> is from Mr. Giglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6570.357s">I</a> know he was on earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6572.958s">Yes,</a> he's still on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6575.119s">There's</a> a kind of funny thing about the letters, which now we have this way that people can submit letters, but they're also on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6585.503s">But</a> anyway, I think I need to read it because it was submitted through the proper channels, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6592.169s">It</a> says, dear school committee, with the recent removal of one of the Columbus School renaming committee members due to his social media comments, many Medford residents strongly feel that the process is tainted and flawed due to not only his anti-bias views, but other committee members and their similar social media comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6609.475s">Although</a> this former member no longer sits on the committee, his suggestion that there was widespread cheating as well as his comments made about a particular race and nationality of people who took the time to fill out the response form is absolutely absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6621.818s">I</a> would also like to bring up the disturbing fact that the beginning of the last renaming meeting, a letter was read on behalf of the NAACP. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6629.64s">I</a> believe, and I could be wrong, that the public was told that there would be no public participation of any kind during these renaming committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6636.683s">Not</a> only was the NAACP, who does not sit on the renaming committee letter, but it also mentioned other issues and ideas that were suggested to be <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6646.58s">next</a> on the agenda to be pushed through in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6649.802s">I've</a> obtained and read the letter that the NAACP wrote that was addressed to the mayor of Medford and dated March 12th, 2021, which was before the renaming committee was chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6662.248s">This</a> leads many people to believe that someone within the school committee or school system had this push through to be read during the meeting on May 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6670.032s">Madam</a> mayor and school committee chair, with so many issues that have arisen during this process, which included certain timeline dates, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6676.455s">made</a> but not kept by the school committee and with the removal of the renaming committee member along with the NAACP letter that suggests changing other rules and policies the Medford community kindly asks that the Columbus school renaming process please cease and be re-evaluated request this Columbus school renaming process be added to the ballot for the November 2021 election <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6699.728s">to</a> afford a fair process for all residents to have a say in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6704.273s">Please</a> consider this request respectfully, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6710.84s">18</a> year resident.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6715.225s">So</a> Mayor, I have, no, if I may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6720.776s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6721.537s">Yeah,</a> I would support if the advisory committee needs more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6727.681s">I</a> certainly would think that we can accommodate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6732.285s">I</a> will tell you that I did eavesdrop on the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6736.488s">I</a> saw the committee slugging through the weeds of process. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6742.492s">then</a> I was very appreciative to all of them because that's the kind of hard work, the difficult conversations, the trying to figure out what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6755.236s">And</a> I certainly saw, while I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with every comment that was made, I certainly saw people working with good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6765.438s">And</a> I was very appreciative to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6768.899s">So</a> my personal belief is that if the committee has asked us for more time, then absolutely in the interest of them going forward, we should accommodate their schedule.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6799.777s">I</a> think we should hear from other members.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6851.614s">Roll</a> call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6852.675s">Wait,</a> wait, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6854.275s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6855.236s">Is</a> June 7th really giving them the time they need?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6869.397s">Okay,</a> the other thing I would just wanted to mention before we do the roll call is we also received a letter from the Columbus Elementary staff, which I know is going to be shared with the committee, the advisory committee at their next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6884.901s">It</a> was a letter really suggesting some other alternatives that perhaps weren't as loaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6892.022s">I</a> believe I heard Mr. Lister mentioned in a letter back to <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6900.264s">Vicki</a> Mello, who sent it on behalf of Columbus teachers, that he was going to read it at their next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6908.247s">And</a> I would be very interested in also hearing their opinion on the letter.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6963.837s">Melanie.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8326.528s">I'd</a> actually like to defer to the to miss Cugno and Adam, who so if I could have
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8509.481s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8510.501s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8511.641s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8525.395s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8526.816s">I</a> would support sending this to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8529.158s">I</a> think there's lots of issues involved, including whether we have the personnel, whether we have the systems in place, perhaps we're identifying an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8539.187s">I</a> may be sounding kind of old school, but, you know, I have some concerns about parents talking to their kids all throughout the school day because, and I always saw that, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8554.316s">that</a> certainly if there's a concern around transportation or who's going where, whatever, those are communications that do need to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8565.919s">But</a> also, I think there's a lot of questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8572.24s">So</a> I support it going to the subcommittee.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8718.675s">Yeah,</a> Kathy, go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8788.812s">Yes,</a> so Mayor, I do think it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8792.675s">My</a> only concern is that we've just sent the advisory committee to make their presentations on the 7th <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8801.551s">And</a> I don't know whether it's more complicated or less complicated for them if all of a sudden we say, oh, well, yeah, we're going to be in the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8810.217s">So</a> that's something I'm a little uncertain about. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8814.08s">I</a> think we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8817.883s">You</a> think you're fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8818.943s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8819.984s">So</a> then fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8821.405s">Then</a> I would say that we should return and it should be, you know, it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8826.389s">Luckily,</a> it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8827.49s">Thank</a> God it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8829.491s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8830.272s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9198.158s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to mention that I do think in the future, and I don't know exactly what the governor's advisory is going to be, but there also is, there is a plus side to sometimes having Zoom meetings, either weather related or whether you members are, you know, so I'm hoping that as we go forward into this next phase, and as we figure out meetings, that we're both returning to chambers, which will be <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9228.278s">a</a> delight for many of us, but also that since we've now have this capability of doing meetings by Zoom, that sometimes we might opt to do a subcommittee meeting or something by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9241.932s">So</a> it'll be interesting as we go forward.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=157.49s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3069.723s">I'm</a> going to pick up right at the end about the busing for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3075.188s">Dave,</a> you've presented us with some interesting options, but with quite big differences in pricing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3087.638s">At</a> this point, as you're building this budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3090.347s">What</a> are you, are you making a recommendation to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3095.088s">Are</a> we gonna, I mean, how are you going to factor in the cost into the budget?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">So</a> Dave, let's go back to one of the things you said about the mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3234.261s">And</a> I have to tell you, I really don't recall taking any vote on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">Yeah,</a> I would be, I think it was perfectly understandable that our ridership diminished a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3285.217s">I</a> know in Medford, there's been a history of some students receiving bus service because of concerns about the roads where they live, the safety of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3301.67s">So</a> to just say automatically it's a mile, well, it's never been just automatically a mile.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">Yeah,</a> well, part of it is, you know, perceived safety or it's been in place for such a long time, any move to take away will certainly cause an uproar. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3354.75s">So</a> it seems like, I hear you on the optimistic level, we're gonna have some space and so we can utilize an existing bus <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3364.49s">That</a> does sound very optimistic to me, Dave, and I am optimistic in general, but- I'm not so ready to balance each other out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3373.877s">Yeah,</a> and at the high end, it's 350, which is a huge chunk of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3378.44s">And</a> there are some, I'm just trying to say as we, with such a big number, it's hard to understand exactly where you're gonna come down to in terms of what we're putting into the budget.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.875s">And</a> the same time, and I appreciate the, uh, my colleagues having raised this issue because it is an issue and it is a, uh, a fairness issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3412.339s">So,</a> um, I think clearly we're going to have to have more conversations on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3416.901s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3417.441s">I</a> yield to someone else.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6842.173s">Yeah,</a> but I think we need to determine, Mayor, we don't need, we can't wait till September to have the discussion about what we're gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6850.019s">No,</a> no, June, right.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5218.33s">I</a> wanted to move on, if we could, to music and oral language. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5224.061s">And</a> I had several questions first. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5225.905s">I</a> think I'm going to take the music part up first, the fine arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5231.341s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5232.462s">So</a> my concern is, and we touched upon this in our subcommittee meeting on curriculum, but we've had a whole group of students miss their fourth grade string program and a whole group of students miss their fifth grade string program. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5250.589s">And</a> as we all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5252.094s">This</a> becomes the feeder programs for the upper level high school band and orchestra, which I think are such vital opportunities for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5261.078s">So</a> I'm curious about, and I realize this strays slightly from the budget, but there may be budget implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5267.98s">How</a> are we going to, so let's take for the group of next year's fifth graders who missed fourth grade strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5277.015s">Will</a> the violin become a possible alternative for them in the lineup of beginning instruments? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5285.538s">And</a> will we need more instruments for that reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5289.945s">And</a> so I'm trying to figure out how we're going to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5295.346s">And</a> then that goes into, then we've also missed a whole group of students who missed their first year of instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5303.348s">And</a> it's crucial for them to have that start if they're going to be in middle school music opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5311.65s">So</a> could you address that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5448.92s">Bernadette,</a> you've really not answered my question, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5452.561s">If</a> you would, will fifth graders have the opportunity to play violin next year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5497.972s">So</a> I'm just wondering if we might need more violins next year, even if the school district is renting them because all of a sudden we have the kids who are moving from third to fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5508.463s">Now</a> I'm working on the assumption that next year we are going to at least be able to offer violin because it's not a woodwind, it's not a blowing instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5517.099s">So</a> that's why I'm starting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5519.642s">I'm</a> saying, you know, there may be fifth graders who didn't get the opportunity in fourth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5525.306s">Do</a> we have, we've traditionally provided those instruments for the students for a nominal, I think $25 a year fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5532.272s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5533.073s">Some</a> of which is waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5534.634s">do</a> we have the capacity in terms of number of instruments or do we need to think about what are we going to do in order to expand? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5543.617s">Because</a> the goal has to be that in the long run that we're offering kids the opportunity so that we can get over this hump so that we continue our wonderful thriving orchestra which has boasted more than 100 members strong for years.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5660.753s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5664.935s">So</a> if I can follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5668.177s">So</a> obviously that's a big concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5671.659s">And</a> also how we look at the fifth grade band instrument program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5680.044s">I</a> still don't know what we don't necessarily know whether we'll be able to be offering all those instruments as far as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5688.149s">This</a> is one area where I'm wondering whether a summer program makes any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5692.732s">Um,</a> you know, just to bolster if depending on what the, what the requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5698.485s">Um,</a> and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5701.485s">I</a> guess it also opens up a bigger question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5704.066s">Now,</a> Bernadette, I'd wanna be clear that this is with no reflection on the job you've been doing, but you will know that from all my years on the committee, I've been a proponent of the fine arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5717.491s">And</a> while I'm very mindful and understand that perhaps we're looking at how departmentalized we are, I am concerned that in the fine arts, it's really important <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5730.467s">for</a> us to have the specialty of musicians and artists overseeing the department and the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5740.474s">And</a> so while Bernadette has stepped in and done the hard work this year, I've always said, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5749.8s">hey,</a> I don't want fine arts to become a second fiddle to all the other departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5755.564s">There</a> was a joke in there, but you know, to all the other departments over time, we need to make sure that our fine arts department is as important as all the other departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5767.311s">And</a> so I worry about that and I want to know, you know, going forth right now, you're not suggesting a separate director, but the question will be, what will the plan be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5854.294s">I</a> just want to make sure that we budgetarily have plans as well and to make sure that we have enough resources to cover the needs whether it be an instrument or additional teaching staff or whatever to make up for this year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6467.413s">Yes,</a> I had a question now, if we're ready to move on to world language? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6474.417s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6476.214s">So</a> my question is, Bernadette, you mentioned that there's a $49,000 line item for the introduction of French in grade six, but it didn't look like, was that inclusive of also money for needed textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6551.367s">Okay</a> and the second question is really has to do with something you didn't mention but that is we've now no longer have an Italian program at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6564.837s">We</a> really haven't talked too much about what's going to happen there but I'm going to direct the question of saying you know the one thing about the Italian program is it brought in kids horizons in understanding that there are countries that speak a totally different language and use different money and <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6581.473s">you</a> know, all of the different things that go along with learning about a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6589.298s">And</a> I'm just wondering how we are going to incorporate that type of learning into our curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6600.124s">You</a> know, again, because we're doing without it, what are we losing and how are we going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6608.826s">make</a> sure that our students have that, you know, without waiting until sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6615.471s">You</a> know, I've mentioned before, I have a grandson who goes to school in another state, and he's in an intensive French program from kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6622.997s">He</a> speaks French. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6623.757s">He's</a> in first grade now, and he speaks French. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6626.839s">It's</a> amazing, and we're not doing that, but his also understanding of things like <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6631.903s">Time</a> zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6632.804s">He's</a> in first grade of time zones and of, you know, money and games and all the other things that learn that take place about learning about another country. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6641.933s">So</a> I'm kind of curious, and I realized that maybe it hasn't been thought about too much at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6647.719s">Because</a> it's been a tough year, but I'm wondering about that type of learning and how are we going to incorporate it into our <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6655.425s">the</a> lives of our elementary kids.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6746.747s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4169.56s">Yes,</a> we met from four to 530 on April 28 that evening we discussed the science curriculum and the fine arts curriculum of particular importance in terms of science was that clearly this year was not a particularly good year for hands on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4190.68s">learning,</a> but we should be set up for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4193.481s">The</a> sequence of courses has changed in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4198.502s">In</a> ninth grade, we're doing biology and 10th grade chemistry and grade 11 and 12 are electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4209.025s">In</a> the FOSS grades K to five, we're on year two of adoption and the overall cost was 285,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4222.182s">They're</a> in biology in high school at the high school biology, we need to consider adopting a new program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4234.375s">The</a> Pearson Biology 2021 program will cost approximately $47,700 for textbooks and a six-year digital license. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4244.884s">And</a> this is going to be something that we're going to be seeing, hopefully, in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4250.509s">This</a> year, we were given a free year because we were unable to complete the pilot in 2020 for reasons we understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4258.176s">The</a> science department is satisfied with how it was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4262.078s">And</a> there is also a, we are being offered a smaller, slimmer book at no cost, Biology the Core, and it's seen that this book could be used very beneficially for EL and special ed populations because there's less text. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4282.704s">A</a> new electives committee will start next year and we're going to work on promoting a co-teaching model. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4294.747s">It</a> was overly, I think the most important thing was it was clear that there were significant textbook needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4300.869s">And</a> I think that we'll be discussing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4305.981s">In</a> terms of music, of course, there was no singing this year at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4314.086s">However,</a> there were other music lessons that stressed percussive activities and other things as were allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4327.333s">One</a> of the things which we talked a little bit about was that we had, of course, no introduction of the violin program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4334.751s">or</a> of the band program, violin at fourth grade band at fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4340.675s">We</a> also talked about funding for those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4344.877s">The</a> violins are offered to students for 20, I think in the fourth grade, all students get the opportunity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4353.341s">I</a> think the cost for the whole year is 25 and there's $25. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4355.463s">And</a> there is a way of applying to, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4360.75s">not</a> pay that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4362.431s">At</a> the fifth grade level, there is no formalized way of providing students instruments who can't afford the rental fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4371.036s">It's</a> always been an informal, the head of the department working to make sure that every kid who really wanted to play had an instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4379.581s">So</a> we might look at that at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4382.523s">There</a> is a music program called Quaver that was utilized this year to help with the music program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4389.367s">because</a> of all the things we couldn't do, and that seems to have gotten very good results. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4395.912s">There</a> is a much longer, of course, copy of the minutes, but I think I'll leave it at this for the time being.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4439.153s">Mayor,</a> this one, the minutes were done, but they weren't put into our folders. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4443.554s">So</a> we're asking that that holds till the meeting of May 24th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4992.277s">We</a> received two letters this week that expressed concerns about comments that were made at a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5004.09s">So</a> I think I need to read those. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5008.035s">The</a> first one was received was from Jenny pagan says dear mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5014.237s">I'm</a> ready to express my concerns about a motion that was passed by school committee member probably so during school subcommittee meeting the other night, school committee member Mr. so motion to prohibit citizens from saying they are lifelong resident, or how many years they have lived in Medford for during school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5030.555s">during</a> school committee meetings, which are public meetings, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5034.459s">This</a> motion was passed by two other members, Jenny Graham and Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5038.623s">It</a> is set to go in front of the school committee on the whole on May 10th for a vote, which it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5043.128s">But</a> while I understand our city, state and country is changing, I truly worry about the direction we are going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5048.726s">We</a> are censoring like never before. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5050.508s">We</a> are prohibiting what people can say what people can read and what people can watch to prohibit a resident from sitting how many years they have lived somewhere is not only illegal but immoral. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5060.498s">How</a> can you as a mayor and resident allow this we are seriously teetering on dangerous ground when we allow a school committee in a city of 60,000 people to start dictating what residents are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5071.254s">and</a> are not allowed to say in a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5074.015s">The</a> school committee has done very little this year to address the needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5078.015s">I</a> have seen bickering, crying, and complaining in no actual doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5081.096s">You</a> have a superintendent that brings us national news every time there's a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5084.997s">I</a> watch the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5085.697s">I</a> do not need a recap of it by Medford superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5088.317s">We</a> need the school committee and superintendent to help our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5091.478s">You</a> have families suing the district to pay for their children to go to other schools that will help them because Medford district does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5099.493s">I</a> just pause to say, of course, these are the views of this writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5103.136s">I</a> know that suits will cost the city thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5106.078s">And</a> I would know since I've already looked into one for my dyslexic daughter, you have helped one meeting to, you have held one meeting to address the concerns brought forward by the families with dyslexic children in which the high reps of the system came on and praised themselves for early screening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5121.27s">Dessie</a> already made early screening a mandate, but they were right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5124.688s">quite</a> proud to go on, and I think they had anything to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5129.313s">While</a> it's a step, it intervenes without diagnosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5132.183s">So</a> while I am truly happy for the struggling reader in kindergarten to get intervention, I guess the dyslexics in fourth, fifth, middle school and high school can just keep on struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5141.228s">I'm</a> tired, I'm scared, and I'm beyond frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5144.37s">When</a> does it stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5145.391s">When</a> do we start getting back the issue of our children? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5147.752s">We</a> set up committees upon committee to address the 15,000 plus name change of school, but I still cannot get a clear answer of what reading program they're going to give my daughter for dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5156.632s">You</a> have parks falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5158.173s">My</a> daughter was at a basketball clinic today and was covered in dirt because the court is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5162.615s">Same</a> baseball court the students at the Curtis use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5166.697s">Our</a> city is dividing, our school committee is out of control and our superintendent cares more about social justice in other states than she does with the actual children of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5175.242s">You</a> are the elected mayor, do something please before our city falls further apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5179.144s">Thank</a> you, Jenny Lynn Pagan, third generation lifelong Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5184.392s">The</a> other letter which I received was from Jada Higgins, dear elected school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5189.755s">I'm</a> ready to express my concerns of a motion put forward by Mr. Rousseau during a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5195.219s">I</a> am shocked that a school committee member who is elected by the community now believes he has the right to silence the same community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5201.102s">It</a> is our right to have freedom of speech even if the speech doesn't align with Mr. Rousseau's beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5206.427s">The</a> same line he is trying to stop problem from saying when they call in is written in many elected official speeches in Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5213.573s">I</a> don't believe people say it because they believe they are more important than someone who has lived here a shorter time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5218.518s">I</a> believe it said because they are proud to be from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5220.82s">We</a> didn't move here because it was convenient for our commute to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5224.503s">We</a> stayed here because we love it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5226.565s">We</a> love the fact that our kids can go to school with their cousins and with our childhood friends' children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5231.429s">We</a> love that if <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5232.674s">We</a> are running late, we can make a call and either a family member or a friend will always be there to pick our kids up from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5238.496s">We</a> love that our classmates are now the ones protecting this city as police and firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5243.638s">We</a> love it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5244.478s">My</a> parents both grew up here and chose to stay and raise their children here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5248.8s">My</a> brother and I have made the same choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5250.941s">We</a> chose this for the love of our city and the great people who make up this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5255.128s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. Rousseau, do the job you were elected to do and focus on the children in this community education. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5261.411s">Focus</a> on the kids struggling daily with learning disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5264.113s">Focus</a> on getting all students back to school safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5266.974s">Focus</a> on closing the gap between children and stop dividing the cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5270.236s">Focus</a> on creating an environment in the schools where kids can be kids and have fun while learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5274.799s">Focus</a> on finding and writing grants to update MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5278.24s">There</a> are so many other areas you could focus on, but silencing this community should never be your focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5283.323s">Sincerely,</a> Jada Higgins, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5285.064s">a</a> lifelong resident, mother of three, school-aged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5289.728s">Those</a> are the two letters I received.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5454.766s">Yes,</a> well, I just want to say that, you know, I wasn't part of that subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5462.028s">I</a> certainly would not support anything that says that a community member can't express how long they lived in Medford or their lifelong residence, or if they just moved in yesterday, because I do believe it's a question of the person who's coming before us has <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5481.334s">The</a> right to speak openly and for many people, they want to express that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5488.646s">So</a> I don't know how exactly that conversation all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5493.145s">went</a> forward, we did not have the transcript of the meetings tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5496.766s">And</a> I understand that Mr. Russo is going to relook at that if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5502.929s">But</a> I don't want to speak for the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5504.529s">I'm</a> just expressing my own own personal feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5507.43s">I</a> also want to stand up and say thank you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5511.612s">We've</a> heard this now reframe a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5514.533s">about</a> concerns when she mentions other things, other events that are going on in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5520.377s">I</a> think it's very important that we realize that we are part of the world and the things that the superintendent is talking about, certainly around social justice issues, racism, diversity issues, that those are important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5537.046s">And</a> that I actually take exception to people who don't feel <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5542.95s">You</a> know, we are sitting here and listening intently. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5548.173s">We</a> give opportunity to the community to speak, but I also certainly want to always be open and hearing our superintendent express her thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5558.52s">That's</a> really, frankly, what we pay her for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5560.761s">Thank</a> you, member Kreatz.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9591.361s">Yes,</a> I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9593.202s">So</a> Paul, I thought if you're asking for a report like this, we're sending it to the superintendent, and she will tell us whether <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9604.272s">what</a> the timeline and whether it's doable should be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9607.415s">Isn't</a> that according to our policy?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9627.651s">But</a> you put a date in and I thought that the idea was to ask the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9633.66s">for</a> a reasonable timeline?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9638.121s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9659.395s">I</a> certainly support the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9660.897s">I</a> just think in keeping what we're doing is we're asking the two superintendents to say when is a reasonable time for us to get this report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9674.933s">So</a> I'll make a motion that we send it to the superintendent's office so that we can find out when a reasonable time to get the report back is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9686.936s">I</a> think it's worthwhile doing for every, you know, to find out the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9692.817s">I</a> just don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9984.532s">Yeah,</a> we're talking about whether the timeline on the report is feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9992.277s">We're</a> not making a bigger discussion about the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9997.18s">I</a> mean, are we interested in having the report really is the question I think is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10003.583s">So</a> that's what we're talking about right now is are we interested in having a report? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10007.005s">And</a> I've said, yes, I'm interested in having a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10010.067s">And</a> then I want it to go to the superintendent, and I want her office to determine when is a reasonable time to get this information to us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10604.172s">If</a> I can ask it in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10606.973s">Generally,</a> how many kids are referred to special ed a year pre pandemic 2030.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10625.88s">So,</a> and this year, do you think the number, you know, if we had an idea of what it has been, has the number significantly reduced? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10638.467s">Or</a> are you, you know, are you getting a lot of referrals into your office? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10643.09s">Do</a> you think you're getting more referrals this year than ever before?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10678.377s">So,</a> again, I think my colleagues intent, I think, and you can correct me Paul if I'm wrong, is just to make sure that there are kids who aren't being overlooked because they've been on zoom rather than in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10698.354s">Um,</a> and so I think that's, if that's what we're looking for, is the, uh, comparative data, which he suggests, is that the way to go about it or is there a better way, um, for us to, to figure it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10712.044s">And</a> how do we make sure under these circumstances that we're not overlooking kids?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11296.709s">So,</a> I think, two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11298.33s">First</a> of all, I think that we need to ask the administration to advise us when what sort of report, and when. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11308.946s">it</a> would be available to get at some of these issues that Paul is raising or is concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11318.93s">I</a> do wanna remind my colleague that just tonight we did hear that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education thought we were doing really good job and that there is, I guess I do have a sense of, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11334.337s">some</a> level of trust in our special education staff that they are following up, that they are, that our teachers are very much, whether a child is on Zoom or in person, that they are on top of it, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11354.564s">So</a> in order to move this discussion along, I think that we should just simply ask <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11362.386s">our</a> superintendent's office and whatever, to consider what the issues that my colleague has raised, because he's got some concern and I understand it, to make sure that we are not inappropriately budgeting in the future, and making sure that if there is a wave of upcoming students or if we're really off, if the numbers really don't make sense, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11390.023s">that</a> they get back to us and give us an idea of what they think makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11395.539s">That's</a> what I would advise. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11399.361s">So</a> Paul's got a motion on it on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11404.124s">I</a> would amend it and ask that the superintendent's office come back to us with their suggestion for a report which would look at data and answer some of the concerns that my colleague has. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11426.536s">But</a> I'd like to hear from them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11439.922s">I</a> haven't said by June, but discuss what data they can give us and what suggestions they have for reports.<h2><a href="../2021-05-06_cg01zn2P9mU/2021-05-06_cg01zn2P9mU.html">Budget Hearing:  Special Education</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=17.611s">I</a> saw his name.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=23.152s">There</a> he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=24.092s">He's</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=25.372s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=25.612s">I</a> am here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2515.434s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2515.774s">Member</a> Van de Kloop? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2519.536s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2520.496s">I</a> just wanted to ask a quick question about the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2523.558s">Could</a> you tell me what the current population of the school is right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2528.861s">And</a> also, were there some students, did all students start coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2535.924s">Or</a> do we have any fully remote students at the Curtis Tufts?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2559.946s">So</a> do the Curtis Tufts teachers, are they interacting with those students specifically?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.205s">Next</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.865s">You</a> mentioned the program, Boston Recovery Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2591.868s">In</a> what ways would that differ from, say, a student going to the Curtis Tufts?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2619.56s">Yeah,</a> it falls within, I mean, I think it's great that we're building something in because certainly one of the biggest problems in this realm is that we don't usually get to build stuff into our budget, it seems. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2633.47s">And</a> then all of a sudden somebody moves into the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2636.292s">And</a> so I think that that's a very positive move, but I just wanted to make the distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2641.817s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4166.722s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4167.823s">First</a> I wanted to mention that it happens to be National Nurses Day today. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4172.825s">So</a> Tony I wanted to bring that and say particularly to our all of our nursing staff who's done such a tremendous job this year but to you in particular as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4182.831s">And,</a> you know, we <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4185.332s">We</a> really haven't given you all the senior praises yet, but we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4190.116s">It's</a> very sad to know that you are retiring, but boy, what a way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4196.141s">Tony,</a> you certainly pulled out all the stops this year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4206.149s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4207.21s">I</a> just want to ask you a little bit more about the four additional people you've <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4213.175s">recommend</a> it in terms of tracking the COVID and for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4219.481s">What</a> exactly, could you expand on the role, I mean that's a, you know, four more nurses, <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4227.559s">Could</a> you speak to it a little bit more?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4305.885s">Right,</a> so the difficult part with that is that, you know, please God, when this passes, you know, at which point we've now hired in, <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4315.38s">you</a> know, a team of four people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4317.681s">And</a> then we're just sort of saying, you know, I'm trying to figure out how that works.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4345.34s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4346.92s">Thank</a> you, Tony.<h2><a href="../2021-05-03_AtnH2HGG3A4/2021-05-03_AtnH2HGG3A4.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2405.595s">Rachel,</a> hold on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2407.875s">I</a> just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2468.735s">Okay,</a> so are there questions at this time on the health education? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2473.397s">What's</a> the preference? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2475.798s">Jenny,</a> what would you prefer to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2477.618s">Do</a> you wanna move on or do you wanna?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.762s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.862s">Jenny,</a> do you have any questions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2973.485s">Rachel</a> can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2981.675s">Perhaps</a> you could share it with, with, with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2985.58s">So</a> we could see how they're handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2988.904s">And</a> is that something you're. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2991.479s">that</a> comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3011.316s">Okay,</a> Susie.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3015.719s">Susie,</a> I see your hand up, Susanne.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3064.122s">It</a> certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3072.107s">I</a> mean, we have come a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3074.468s">So</a> I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3081.712s">Paul?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3126.666s">I</a> wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3132.871s">And</a> I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3135.573s">Does</a> that still?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3151.798s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3153.039s">Okay,</a> so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3159.162s">And</a> then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3161.403s">And</a> if we have time, we can come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3163.724s">So</a> if you'd be so kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3166.025s">I</a> promise this one will be quicker.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.079s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.44s">Thank</a> you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3763.601s">Rachel,</a> I'm going to start off the questioning this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3766.405s">You</a> did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3772.615s">The</a> adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3778.543s">for</a> instance, autistic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3780.985s">And</a> you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3784.447s">But</a> as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3789.469s">For</a> example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3833.773s">And</a> is that then an outside curriculum?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3842.236s">It's</a> free? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.056s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.636s">Music</a> to my ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3844.857s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3845.597s">I</a> thought that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3848.178s">Is</a> there a way? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3849.298s">Could</a> you send us a link for that so we could see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3851.939s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3852.939s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3855.14s">So</a> to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3965.263s">So</a> Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3979.849s">And</a> so there was much discussion about <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3984.41s">looking</a> at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3998.319s">It</a> was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4006.524s">But</a> I do want to say that this was something that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4010.807s">I</a> don't know if that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4011.387s">Thoroughly</a> talked about on the school committee level.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4315.032s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4316.233s">Are</a> there any other questions for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4318.335s">Perry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4320.645s">Rachel,</a> Paul, no, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4325.486s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4326.926s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.566s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.967s">So</a> thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4331.607s">I</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4333.868s">And</a> we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4344.19s">Seven</a> o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4346.224s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4346.625s">So</a> we'll see you all at seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4348.208s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4348.709s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4349.29s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4350.032s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4351.214s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4353.679s">Paul</a> Russo?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4356.325s">Jenny</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4357.207s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4358.008s">Paulette</a> VanderKloop? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4358.73s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA/2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA.html">Budget Meeting:  Elementary and Secondary</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2413.443s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2414.083s">I</a> had a question regarding the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2416.826s">I</a> wasn't quite sure whether the request was paraprofessionals at every grade level for every school, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2426.093s">20-something</a> paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2429.796s">Could</a> you clarify, please?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2584.671s">I</a> have more questions, but I think we should rotate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.05s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.55s">As</a> I'm listening to this discussion, I can't help but feel the word that Suzanne just used was opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5581.837s">And</a> there is here an incredible opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5585.14s">Part</a> of it will depend on how we structure it and how creative we can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5592.606s">in</a> terms of meeting the needs of our kids, but also providing that sort of what Paul suggests, extra outside time, extra time where social and emotional needs are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5605.53s">And</a> it's really very interesting just to think about as this conversation has taken a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5611.392s">Now,</a> of course, that's gone a little bit far from the budget, but it's been worthwhile to <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5616.374s">Listen</a> into to think about going back to the budget, I just really many of my colleagues asked questions that I already had on my list, but I just wanted to be clear if before you were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5629.439s">For</a> example, it happened to be the Columbus School, but there were other things listed, like replacing outdated Chromebooks so that we could maintain the pandemic purchases, or replacement tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5642.049s">I</a> assume that we'll be discussing things like that in the particular, under different parts of the budget.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5749.695s">Yeah,</a> so and also to follow up and I realized that Principal Kaye has been very detailed here, but she did mention in her pages replacement of walkie talkies for the TLP program.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5774.91s">Okay,</a> Chris, I would certainly be concerned that if there were broken equipment for that particular need, that it would not wait for next year, but it would, in fact, we would find a way to do it this year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5858.389s">And</a> I very much appreciate the coordinated presentation at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5864.012s">There's</a> just some of these details and it's actually quite good to hear that, yes, that's taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5868.935s">Yes,</a> that's taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5869.955s">So</a> I appreciate both.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5874.898s">I</a> see that Principal Kaye has her hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6837.378s">Mia</a> has a question.<h2><a href="../2021-04-28_4OUqwVVt47Q/2021-04-28_4OUqwVVt47Q.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=1.268s">She</a> did email the team, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4.17s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4.61s">Yeah,</a> I just didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=6.431s">I've</a> not been looking at my phone for that reason.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=20.62s">Right,</a> because he might be particularly interested in this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=22.881s">Thank</a> you, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=23.922s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=26.368s">So</a> let's see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=28.89s">Everybody</a> else who needs to be here is here though. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=32.293s">So</a> I can at least begin by reading our general script. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=38.239s">So</a> please be advised that on Wednesday, April 28th, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=43.308s">From</a> four to 530 there will be a curriculum subcommittee meeting, which we held through remote participation via zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=50.133s">The</a> purpose of this meeting is to review science and fine arts curriculum in the Medford public schools pursuant to Governor bakers March 12 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=62.953s">chapter</a> 30a paragraph 18 in the governor's march 15th 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place this meeting of the medford school committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible specific information in the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found in the city of medford <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=86.959s">website</a> www.medfordmass.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=89.881s">For</a> this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by assessing the meeting length contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=96.604s">No</a> in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=104.437s">access</a> the meetings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=107.898s">In</a> the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=122.261s">The</a> meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast Channel 22 and Verizon Channel 43 at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=131.779s">Using</a> Zoom, the meeting ID number is 988-447-42816. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=134.101s">A</a> mobile number is 1-929-205-0699. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=135.782s">Our</a> agenda today is that we're going to begin with a review <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=154.892s">Well,</a> today we're discussing both the science curriculum and the curriculum Fine Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=159.679s">So</a> I don't know, perhaps Superintendent, would you like to start us off?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2306.678s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2307.058s">Whoops.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2309.18s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2312.704s">Um,</a> maybe we could stop screens sharing right now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2319.59s">And</a> in the meantime, I'm just going to ask my committee members to do a housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2324.795s">We</a> did not take the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2326.676s">So</a> if I could just call attendance, Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2331.16s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2332.42s">Mia</a> is unable to come, so she's absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2335.842s">And</a> Paul Russo is here sitting in her place for as long as he can stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2343.905s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2346.906s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2348.026s">Yes,</a> Paul, go ahead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2701.247s">I</a> actually had a question, Maurice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2704.089s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2705.35s">And</a> I can email you on some of the follow-ups, but I'm surprised that you said the demand for AP environmental is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2713.194s">Do</a> you poll the kids periodically? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2715.096s">How</a> do you know it's low?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2741.671s">Yeah,</a> I'm just thinking that a student might even know, how would a student know that it's potential?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2782.244s">Okay,</a> so in the interest of time, I'll just say it was very clear that there's substantial textbook needs in a variety of not only the ninth grade biology, but which I was very happy to hear that there was a supplement that would be good for our special populations, but also across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2802.1s">So</a> I guess unless there's any other thing pressing from Paul or Jenny, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2807.202s">We</a> should move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2808.462s">Jenny?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2821.726s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2822.046s">Thank</a> you for attending, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2824.367s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2825.287s">Dr.</a> Riccadeli, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2827.688s">Thank</a> you, Rocco.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4428.699s">So</a> let me start off with one Bernadette typically in the music program we start our fifth graders with violin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4436.882s">Can</a> you tell us what What ability did we have to start kids on violin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4442.104s">I</a> mean, I can't this year and also <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4446.808s">beginning</a> instruments in the sixth grade? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4448.669s">And</a> what impact is that going to have on our future band and orchestra programs?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4487.344s">So</a> did fifth graders start violins at all or no?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4559.66s">So</a> in other words, we are hoping that we will be able to provide some opportunities for the kids who missed out, if you would, in the fourth and fifth grade.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4595.924s">Right,</a> because right now you're gonna have in essence two years of beginning strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4599.965s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4601.733s">And</a> I know that we've always kept some instruments aside or some violins for students who can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4609.119s">I</a> think as the committee as a whole has been addressing some of the needs of transportation throughout the city, the rental program becomes a question too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4619.288s">And</a> so I think I don't expect you to have all the answers for this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4623.392s">And</a> I certainly know that there was Mr. Zigny in the past had done everything he can <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4628.738s">to</a> provide instruments to students who wanted to continue but couldn't necessarily afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4635.28s">But</a> I think, you know, I'd really like you to be looking at that question saying, you know, are we able to provide students with the instruments so that we're not losing students who might be talented musicians, but simply because they can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4652.329s">Also,</a> next question, just one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4655.811s">The</a> Quaver Ed that you mentioned, is that a series of lessons? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4659.892s">Or</a> I went online as you were speaking to take a look, but I just wanted to know what we were using it for.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4693.788s">So</a> you think it's $7,000 for K-8? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4694.708s">So</a> it is a K-8 program, however,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4736.892s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4748.083s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4749.225s">Jenny,</a> do you have some questions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4820.175s">But</a> it's a supplement, right?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4824.119s">Okay,</a> so a teacher would use it now and then, not every lesson.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4882.791s">Okay,</a> we'll have to look it up to learn more about it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5157.451s">My</a> personal experience has been that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5162.109s">been</a> something that if anybody knew of a student and it was brought to Mr. Zigney's attention, magically it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5172.116s">So</a> it's been an informal rather than a formal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5175.278s">I</a> don't think kids were cut out, but it was never formalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5181.122s">So,</a> okay, it is 529. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5187.847s">Jenny,</a> do you have any more questions that you can do in 30 seconds? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5191.889s">Nope,</a> that was my last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.009s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.509s">Do</a> you want to make it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5194.39s">Thank</a> you, everybody.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5196.691s">I</a> appreciate you being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5198.712s">I'll</a> call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5199.592s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.372s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.992s">I'll</a> let, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5201.953s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5202.653s">Right</a> under the wire. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5204.094s">Jenny</a> and Superintendent, and if Susie is still on, just if you guys could stay on for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5211.677s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5212.457s">Okay,</a> just so we can talk about the next meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5220.92s">Is</a> Susie still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5222.521s">Yep,</a> I'm right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5223.661s">Oh,</a> great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5224.762s">So</a> Jenny, just while you're here, so at least there's two.<h2><a href="../2021-04-26_6kKbcFkpEqA/2021-04-26_6kKbcFkpEqA.html">4.26.2021 Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=170.059s">Hmm,</a> Paul.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=250.581s">Motion</a> of approval.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=384.085s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=386.706s">Yes,</a> I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=393.007s">Like</a> a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=400.65s">I</a> think it might be more engaging for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=405.371s">The</a> other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=413.906s">We</a> had something like 23 meetings in the in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=418.451s">I</a> think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=430.922s">of</a> doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=437.863s">And</a> I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=663.519s">I</a> will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=698.888s">So</a> I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=709.755s">Maybe</a> a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=717.32s">So</a> do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=724.024s">Great,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=729.296s">Can</a> we move on to the next order of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=731.878s">And</a> I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=737.602s">Because</a> I don't have it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=741.945s">We</a> can't hear you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=772.307s">while</a> you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=781.451s">Perhaps</a> a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=786.893s">And</a> we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=792.936s">Sounds</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=794.937s">And</a> Melanie is going to give her report.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1074.731s">I</a> have one email submitted by William Giglio from Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1082.972s">This</a> is to your school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1084.453s">This</a> is a short but two-part email request. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1087.501s">One,</a> with all due respect and after talking with many other Medford families who tune in to watch Medford Public School Committee meetings, we kindly ask that any and all subjects that do not pertain directly to Medford Public Schools, please be refrained from being discussed during the time of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1102.926s">We</a> as parents tune in each meeting to keep up and stay in touch with what is going on within our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1108.748s">And</a> we do not need updates on news stories that are going on within our nation that do not directly affect this school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1117.202s">Example,</a> at the last meeting, the news of a 20-year-old man in Minneapolis who was shot by police when trying to flee while being arrested was discussed when this had nothing at all to do with the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1127.804s">There</a> are many other city community meetings and other outlets that have the time and place for these types of discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1133.666s">Two,</a> I also kindly request that at the beginning of each Medford school committee meeting, when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, that a flag be present behind or in view of at least one committee member during the time <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1145.04s">that</a> meetings are conducted on Zoom and not in city hall chambers where flag is present. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1150.765s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3361.605s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3362.765s">Just</a> this is kind of a housekeeping comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3366.807s">Because</a> of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3374.99s">We're</a> going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3379.932s">Additionally,</a> and I particularly want to <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3384.024s">highlight</a> this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3392.266s">We'd</a> like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3401.908s">And</a> that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3413.611s">So</a> after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3423.359s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6672.277s">Yes,</a> let's see, member Rousseau, and then I'd like to get, we do have a hand raised by Leticia Rocha. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6679.302s">So</a> member Rousseau.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6880.58s">Yes,</a> may I call on Leticia Roca, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6885.448s">Leticia,</a> are you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6887.011s">Can</a> you unmute yourself?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6894.162s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7035.826s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7036.186s">I</a> see the mayor is back, so I'll hand the reins back to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7041.647s">You</a> need to unmute yourself.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7049.788s">We</a> were discussing the transportation for high school students.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7061.73s">Yes,</a> Melanie would be next. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7063.891s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7486.044s">I</a> had some questions about, first of all, there's a timeline September 1st for comprehensive lists and current job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7494.826s">And</a> I just wanted to understand whether that was realistic given all the demands of going in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7504.588s">So</a> I was just curious about that from central administration, what their reaction to that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7510.189s">I'm</a> a little concerned, I find this, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7513.738s">in</a> many ways pretty confusing and very prescriptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7523.486s">I'm</a> sort of wondering if there's a way we can simplify it to make it more accessible.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7700.569s">Well,</a> let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7701.63s">I</a> was going to say Kathy's had her hand raised.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8042.925s">Member</a> Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8044.765s">Yes,</a> and I would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8046.486s">I'm</a> also just gonna throw out one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8049.867s">So,</a> you know, I just, the terminology, professional staff, what, the rest of our staff is unprofessional? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8058.988s">There</a> may be no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8060.389s">It</a> may just be the common thing, but I'm just going to mention it to say to me, it just sounds so funny.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1280.658s">I'd</a> like to make a comment, if you would. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1282.939s">First,</a> I want to thank everybody who put their name in, and I want to tell you it was very, very difficult to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1289.263s">Part</a> of what I was looking at in my, you know, just quickly, was also determining number of men and number of women, and was it <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1297.268s">you</a> know, did what sort of names to be seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1301.009s">But</a> it was very difficult to decide because there was people wrote passionately, people brought different skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1308.172s">I</a> wanted to include them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1310.132s">And</a> I really wanted just to thank the members of the public who took the step and put their names in for our consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1318.795s">We</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1320.336s">And</a> just because you weren't selected, doesn't mean that you didn't have an awful lot of value to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1325.7s">Because</a> there were a lot of people left on my list who I would have loved to have included.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8155.645s">Mayor,</a> there are two letters that we received. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8158.547s">One</a> is regarding the mathematics curriculum, which makes sense to read just prior to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8165.011s">Khan's</a> presentation this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8167.032s">And</a> the other one is regards to the afterschool program, and it makes sense to read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8172.676s">The</a> parents specifically asked to read that at the outset of the presentation, as they had questions incorporated in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8180.36s">So</a> if I could hold those two to them, that makes the most sense.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8190.948s">Oh,</a> sorry, I was doing an undersecretary's report.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8196.833s">I</a> was like, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8200.858s">Oh,</a> sorry about that, Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8203.06s">We'll</a> just let you get over with it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8224.565s">2021.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8225.585s">So</a> on March 10, 2021, we had a Curriculum Subcommittee meeting that was to be attended by myself, Member Graham, Member Mustone, the Superintendent, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Chiesa gave a PowerPoint presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8244.972s">Now,</a> if you recall, at our last school committee meeting, I asked for this to be held because the PowerPoint presentation was not incorporated into the minutes, and now it is incorporated into the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8256.338s">At</a> the meeting, the first thing we reviewed was state expectations, and then we looked at Medford Public Schools, the district curriculum, professional development, and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8268.846s">equity</a> in English language arts and goals and next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8276.197s">We</a> talked about the early literacy screeners and, again, the district professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8284.044s">There</a> was quite a list that was given and provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8287.988s">The</a> Hill for Literacy, Crafting Minds, Dr. Nadine Gabb, Lexia training, Lexia Core 5 training, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8299.165s">We</a> also talked about the Medford Early Literacy Screener. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8303.247s">The</a> Alexia Rapid is given at the Brooks, McGlynn, and Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8307.629s">And</a> the NWEA Map Growth is given at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8313.351s">There</a> was, of course, some concern about evidence-based instruction and discussion about journeys not being evidence-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8324.056s">and</a> the bringing in of ECRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8326.717s">Some</a> parents had concerns that it is not complete enough and are not supportive and evidence-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8336.144s">There</a> was also a question by member Graham <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8340.267s">who</a> spoke to the fact that there had been a request for a handwriting curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8346.409s">That</a> did not go forward last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8350.35s">I'm</a> not quite sure whether it was only because of COVID or also because of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8357.433s">So</a> that's something that's still on the docket. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8364.384s">There</a> was discussion about the curriculum being more reflective of different cultivating additional programs to support the science of reading, including, but not limited to, ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, Lexia Learning, and NEWS-ELA. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8396.489s">There</a> was also, Dr. Chiesa provided for us a list of price points for various different supports and how much they cost the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8413.177s">The</a> one other thing I just wanted to mention, oh, was, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8417.647s">Equity</a> in ELA, there's been the addition of numerous novels and informational texts by diverse authors, creating an inclusive classroom, inclusion and pacing guides, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8429.824s">and</a> also an edition of News ELA, Exploring Identity and Culture, Mirrors and Windows Collection, A Mile in Our Shoes Collection, and Black Students Matter Collection. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8444.076s">There</a> is another curriculum meeting this Wednesday at four o'clock, and we hope that you can join us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8492.408s">You</a> know, the problem is we're covering so much in the meeting as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8496.112s">I</a> think that while we touched on, you know, resources being included, we haven't had specific, more in-depth conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8508.243s">We</a> have another meeting this Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8510.325s">It's</a> covering two subject areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8513.688s">you</a> know, we're gonna have to go back and I know we had a follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8518.211s">I</a> wasn't thinking it was in the curriculum, Melanie, about the special education resources, but we certainly could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8527.977s">Why</a> don't we talk and we'll figure out how to go forward on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8710.646s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8711.646s">I</a> think Dr. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8715.998s">But</a> at this point, no curriculum has been chosen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8727.643s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8731.945s">I</a> think we have to hold that question right now, and we'll do a follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8737.988s">Oh,</a> there's Dr. Marisa.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9425.975s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9666.945s">Yes,</a> this was a follow-up, a second night of discussion from the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9672.967s">Again,</a> we divided it up into elementary, middle, high school and special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9678.049s">Unfortunately</a> on this night, there were no special education parents and no high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9682.21s">So</a> we went down to the younger levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9686.051s">I</a> think that one, a couple of comments that I just, one member said they thought <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9691.666s">that</a> it was passive rather than active. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9694.368s">And</a> I thought that was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9696.529s">There</a> was some discussion of what's the difference between a mission and a vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9700.452s">And</a> since one of the parents suggested that perhaps as a part of this or the totality, we liked the idea of a short memorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9714.742s">And</a> one parent suggested preparing our students to change the world for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9719.919s">And</a> I thought that was kind of a neat vision statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9722.862s">There</a> was a question of how would we have follow-up and how would that we know parents wanted to make sure that they were part of the follow-up as this was, as we spent more time on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9738.2s">That's</a> it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10161.828s">Mayor</a> Russo, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10168.83s">So</a> in truth, the night that I was there, I was also, I guess, confused because the truth of the matter is that it is the vice chair who's reading those. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10177.512s">So</a> that's not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10179.712s">The</a> big question is, so we have to take that piece out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10184.433s">is</a> whether the secretary believes, and we can ask our current secretary, whether she wants to be put on in the position of every meeting being asked if there's a separate report from the secretary, or whether that is just something a holdover from a prior time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10200.075s">Now,</a> I do know earlier when member Kreatz held the position, she approached it in a very certain way, which was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10209.201s">But</a> the different folks have different feelings about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10214.565s">So</a> the reason, I just wondered what you thought.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10719.525s">Member</a> Van der Kloot, you said there's only- There's two, and one is in relation to the math curriculum, and the other is relation to the afterschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10729.187s">So</a> I thought I might read them at the beginning of each of those sections.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12311.647s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12314.57s">I'm</a> so I do have a letter from the public regarding the math curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12318.752s">I</a> don't know whether I would actually ask Pfizer, whether I should read it at the beginning or at the end of her presentation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12352.891s">I</a> think just because we've... <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12355.072s">the</a> person submitted it appropriately, we should read it very quickly, and then hopefully you'll hit the points. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12362.474s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12363.034s">That'd</a> be perfect.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17137.272s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17139.454s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17141.516s">So</a> the thing is, first I want to thank Megan and Fiddler Carey and David Murphy and Suzanne Galussi and everybody else who's worked on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17151.463s">And</a> certainly there are a lot of positive changes in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17157.408s">It</a> looks <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17160.01s">You</a> know, the increased wages hopefully will help in securing people who want to work in the afterschool. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17167.161s">It's</a> always been a difficult position to hire because it's for a limited amount of time in sort of an awkward part of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17175.513s">I</a> will tell you that I've visited the afterschool on numerous occasions, and I've just been so thrilled with the staff members and their dedication to the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17186.306s">They</a> clearly take their responsibilities very highly, and I've heard such wonderful feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17194.748s">Having</a> said all the positives, the only thing is if I'm looking at this and it was from the first slide with the numbers, we're adding projected 60 spaces, but we've got 144 on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17207.161s">That</a> means if I understood this correctly, there were still 84 families who are being disenfranchised. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17213.408s">And</a> so then the question comes back and saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17216.492s">Okay,</a> great, fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17218.753s">I</a> understand you're trying to be realistic in your projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17223.276s">I</a> understand there are some issues about space, although Mr. Murphy said it was not space alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17229.0s">Probably</a> the hiring, I would guess, is one of the most difficult things altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17236.024s">But</a> how are we going to accommodate the other families who are not accommodated in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17242.548s">And</a> what, what else can we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17244.251s">I</a> wondered and I realized, I absolutely get that there's a whole nother oversight needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17251.542s">We've</a> parents have mentioned that they wanted to be cooperative players I've remembered the days of preschools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17258.072s">where</a> there were cooperative preschools and parents volunteered maybe to work on a Monday and Wednesday, and then their kids went and other parents took over in other days. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17268.66s">And</a> again, I fully appreciate that's a whole nother level of organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17275.385s">But</a> if hiring is the issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17278.594s">And</a> if we're looking still at this gap of 84 families, and I don't know if it's spread throughout the district in particular, that seems to me that's the next challenge and what are we gonna do about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17293.066s">But</a> again, I say this almost kind of like torn, because I wanna tell you, I very much appreciate the work that's been done and the steps that are positive moving forward.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18895.528s">I</a> actually have a question on it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.029s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.31s">So</a> I just have to raise my concern because I've looked at the schedule just to try and get more meetings in with our budget meetings and what we're expecting of our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18910.835s">I</a> mean, maybe we have to ask, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18914.94s">Megan</a> to spearhead this sort of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18919.143s">I</a> just have to express concern that, you know, I think we had 22 meetings last month and I wanna be as responsive to the parents as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18931.352s">I</a> wanna have maybe, you know, is there a way of working committee but a formal school committee meeting to meet with all the parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18938.817s">It</a> just doesn't seem like the most effective way.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19294.912s">Member</a> Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19296.193s">Yeah,</a> I was actually going to suggest the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19298.334s">I</a> think, Mike, my initial concern is we need to make sure that we're giving our administrative people space to do the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19308.878s">But</a> this clearly needs to be in the mix. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19313.681s">The</a> one thing about this topic is we've got to, this isn't one where there's opposition or we're at loggerheads. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19321.484s">We</a> all want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19323.585s">We</a> want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19324.925s">Everyone</a> here, I have no doubt, wants this to happen in a positive way for our families.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19457.168s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19459.129s">I</a> fully support that we want to make sure that we are talking to parents and engaging with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19467.711s">Whether</a> we need a formalized process right now, I'm just trying to say, you know, I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19478.434s">Personally,</a> we've got a very active, engaged group of parents who have, you know, clearly been able to make their voices heard and their <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19487.296s">express</a> their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19489.437s">You</a> know, there's nothing, Melanie, you're sure we can vote on your thing, but I don't want to formalize process and say we're going to have this survey and that survey and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19499.261s">I</a> don't know exactly what it is that you want, that we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19507.017s">I'm</a> responding to short. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19509.099s">We</a> can't trust our staff to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19511.14s">I</a> trust our staff is going to talk to these people.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19931.437s">Yeah,</a> it was referenced in the minutes that we received tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19939.401s">And</a> I was in the elementary meeting on the second night. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19943.282s">So</a> I did hear the parents extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19946.064s">And</a> I realized that you weren't able to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19949.265s">So</a> that may be why we've got a slightly different perspective than you.<h2><a href="../2021-04-07_1FDL4VUFRG4/2021-04-07_1FDL4VUFRG4.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=13.137s">Right,</a> and I'm sitting in for Melanie.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=266.456s">Yes,</a> at least for a while.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=636.66s">I</a> think that in terms of the role, it should be done so that the school committee role is called and announced by the mayor and then it should be, then the student rep should be introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=652.145s">I</a> want a differentiation between it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=656.366s">I</a> know that you're going to spend more time at some point talking about the role of the student reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=664.037s">I</a> had some misgivings or concerns about some areas of your conversation only because in my long-term, I will tell you that there are years that you have great student reps and they're there and they're participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=680.411s">And</a> there's years where you don't, and there's years where you have very confident kids and years where you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=686.756s">And</a> we just need to be very, very careful about what we're setting up so to make it a true positive learning experience rather than someone on the hot seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=698.563s">And</a> we need to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=700.904s">We</a> happen to have had some very strong representatives while you guys have been on the committee, but that's not always the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=709.288s">And</a> there were years when, frankly, we didn't have kids who were interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=716.032s">you</a> don't you don't want to put them in a place of embarrassment either where you're keeping on asking if they're present and they're not or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=723.441s">So</a> I just think one we need to I think it's great and we certainly just prior to <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=732.612s">When</a> Dr. Perlow was the head, we had had some discussions because I think Paul, I think you and I had, we had actually gone to a MASC event about student reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=746.668s">And</a> I talked to many student reps about what their role was. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=750.753s">I</a> came back feeling that we weren't being significant about it, but then that kind of fell through the cracks because we changed, you know, principles and we're starting, we started over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=763.225s">So</a> anyway, that's my two cents.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=834.796s">I</a> don't know, cause I haven't really thought about it, but I mean, now when they, now often the mayor will make an announcement as she, when we call the roll, she'll make an announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=848.226s">So</a> it's sort of to formalize that so that she'll also announce who's present.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=883.204s">Yes,</a> but those two people aren't part of the quorum, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=886.066s">That's</a> why I was making the- I know, Paulette.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=900.854s">Yeah,</a> I don't- Dave has his hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=935.242s">We</a> took the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=936.022s">And</a> then if the students were present, the mayor announced them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=956.053s">You</a> know, I think what the problem is, is whether the mayor, what Jenny's saying is she doesn't know whether they're there, and probably Brianna doesn't always know if they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=967.302s">And</a> so by calling their name, you know if they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=971.285s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1394.402s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1405.573s">Sorry,</a> I don't want to belabor the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1408.934s">I</a> was just concerned about making a separation so it was clear for people who didn't know, you know, that they're not voting members or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1416.657s">They're</a> student members. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1418.018s">So</a> anyway, I think we should go on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1615.988s">Yeah,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1616.968s">I've</a> always seen it as the warmup, but I can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1625.839s">You</a> know, I've questioned about the report of the secretary because I think it's just something that's been on there forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1633.287s">And</a> I mean, different people have handled it in different ways, but, you know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1646.36s">So</a> that, you know, if you can, I just don't know whether it makes sense if we were looking to take something out, but I'm not the secretary right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1657.784s">But</a> I do know that when you're the secretary, I mean, Kathy used to go and she would highlight a particular bill or something, you know, which sometimes was interesting, but, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1669.99s">you</a> know, it's not that as secretary you get so many, I mean, it's a rare time that you would get a letter or something that went to you only, except now that we have the school committee, you know, letters, which come under community participation, so.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1753.503s">Particularly</a> in the recent times.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1757.003s">I</a> mean, you know, this has been extraordinary.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1775.895s">I</a> mean, the interesting thing is if the secretary is called on nowadays, he or she should be called on during community participation to say, are there any letters that have been sent in? <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1790.021s">So</a> in some ways, the secretary's report should move and be part of community participation to highlight the outside letters.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1804.316s">And</a> that piece sometimes, frankly, the mayor forgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1808.557s">So</a> it would be useful to have, it's a tweak, I think.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2110.867s">I</a> think that the motion should be that the secretary's report be moved to under community participation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2130.492s">Right,</a> a bullet underneath.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2174.118s">I</a> need you to just in a sentence or two, tell me exactly what you're saying when you say consent agenda.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2208.176s">I</a> think that you can do that for minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2213.177s">I</a> think that there are certain ones that have to be called. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2217.419s">I</a> think you have bills and payrolls, I think have to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2223.328s">I</a> think we need to investigate that to find out whether that's true or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2227.73s">But</a> that's my, for the ones that we can, I'd certainly be, that would be okay with me, but we need to be clear which ones are which.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2329.854s">Oh,</a> yeah, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2332.735s">Yeah,</a> I'll look at it later, but I'd like to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2336.148s">So</a> if you found one that has it, that'd be great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2415.496s">Yeah,</a> we can move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2417.937s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2418.277s">I</a> have to think about it a little more, but we certainly can move it forward to the main meeting.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4033.472s">So</a> the one that I read, what we were really talking about is what key phrases came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4040.075s">And</a> we had a discussion about how important the school environment, how it had become clear this year that the school environment was so important in nurturing our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4052.46s">And</a> we talked about equity, and we talked about adaptability and resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4056.822s">So</a> we were just trying to incorporate some of those key concepts, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4063.125s">But,</a> you know, the shorter the better in so many ways.<h2><a href="../2021-03-22_x6UMczRpx7Y/2021-03-22_x6UMczRpx7Y.html">Committee of the Whole Meeting - CIP</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2030.491s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to suggest that it would be a better use of our time rather than guessing at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2036.753s">I</a> know I've had very detailed conversations about the air compressors with John McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2041.674s">If</a> he was here, he would be answering every one of our questions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2046.015s">Um,</a> and I remember when they were replaced, um, the same thing with the other, uh, the details along the fire extinguishers. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2053.421s">So</a> it might be that we want to, um, hold the details and ask John for an update on the specifically on the, um, uh, what you're referring to the document you're referring to Jenny.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3040.422s">Yeah,</a> so I need to understand what we need to decide tonight, because clearly there's a much larger <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3049.718s">question,</a> which is to say, how much money are we going to put into the current Medford High School? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3056.522s">If</a> in fact, at some future time, we envision a rebuilding or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3064.526s">And</a> so I need to know just tonight, what decision we need to make? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3071.709s">Was</a> this brought to us because we're trying to make a decision about whether we're gonna expend the money for the bathrooms?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2982.41s">I</a> would actually like to table them to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2984.771s">I</a> see that Dr. Quilles' report, a link wasn't provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2989.732s">And</a> the discussion will make much more sense with that link. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2992.372s">So</a> I'm going to talk to, we'll figure it out by the next meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3178.345s">Yes,</a> Mayor, we received six communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3181.489s">The</a> first one is entitled Info Request for Advisory Committee Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3186.455s">It</a> was submitted by Luchita Hiller, 58 Metcalf Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3192.299s">She</a> says, hi, I am trying to find information on how to apply for the advisory committee in charge of picking the new names to replace existing Columbus school name and how to submit new name nominations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3204.408s">I</a> have been looking through the MPS website and could not find anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3207.991s">Can</a> you direct me to the right place where this information lives? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3211.034s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3213.976s">Would</a> someone like to address that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3243.541s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3244.442s">So</a> the next letters, there's five letters and they're all on the same topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3248.648s">I'll</a> read one from the first one that was submitted on this topic was from Sharon Hayes of 69 Ripley Road and then I'll tell you who submitted the other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3259.883s">It</a> says, dear superintendent and school committee members, I am writing to you as a parent of two elementary school children who are currently enrolled in the full remote learning at the Roberts and who will remain in remote learning for the rest of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3272.226s">I</a> am very concerned that the students who plan to remain in the remote classes not be subjected to additional changes due to the April 5th shift to full-time in-person learning for the current hybrid students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3284.188s">The</a> remote teachers have spent the last six plus months working hard to create a classroom community and new daily routines in virtual learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3291.514s">While</a> both of my boys are struggling with the virtual aspect of virtual learning, they love being a part of the classroom community and seeing the same classmates and teacher every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3301.401s">And</a> as a parent, I know that the classroom routines keep them feeling grounded and secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3305.764s">If</a> any of these things are changed now with less than a third of the year remaining, if students are regrouped and put with different classmates and or a new teacher, it will cause yet another major disruption in the lives of young children who are still living through an intensely difficult and traumatizing event. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3322.479s">Please</a> do not make changes to the remote learning classrooms between now and the end of the school year." <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3328.784s">That</a> sentiment was shared and we received a <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3334.53s">email</a> from Arshia Amina of 37 Ashland Street, from Shanine Pelequin, she did not give an address, of Michelle Ciccolo of 28 Douglas Road, of Wynette Vo, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3359.114s">Um,</a> also no address and of Claire Flaherty of Marshall Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3365.716s">Um,</a> all of those, these centers, uh, echoed the same concerns of the first letter, um, about remote learning.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3443.457s">May</a> I ask, Superintendent, are you going to address this this evening?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4990.376s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4991.73s">Yes,</a> I would raise my hand also to express my concerns that it seems like we've made a commitment to our remote kids and it doesn't seem fair to all of a sudden put them in a predicament, though I hear what you're telling us, Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5009.517s">I</a> think probably right now it makes most sense to turn to the community members who've had their hands raised for quite a long time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8563.112s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8564.353s">I</a> wanted to ask another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8566.294s">Why</a> don't we vote on this one first?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8607.988s">Yes,</a> I just want to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8609.088s">I</a> mean, the programs that we spoke about this evening are also the programs that have taken place before, so it's great to have an update about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8616.99s">But</a> are we anticipating any further remedial type programs for students during the summer? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8623.132s">I</a> was kind of curious about where we're going to go with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9228.847s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9229.228s">Do</a> we have a rain date for graduation?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10147.516s">Yes</a> I just I want to it's I've received another email and I did note that the speaker was was here I see him but it's from Matthew Page Lieberman of 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10163.424s">His</a> question is I'd like to know what options are available to a MHS senior <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10171.281s">I</a> recently met who told me of her struggles to get the assistance she requires for her mental health from the school system after attempts have failed with her guidance Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10182.425s">I</a> can answer a couple of things.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10250.541s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10252.942s">So</a> can I direct the sender to tell the student to contact you directly?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10263.672s">Okay,</a> and that you will make sure, or superintendent, go ahead.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=985.906s">Yes,</a> I just want to mention that one of the real key issues about the after school program is personnel, is getting enough people to cover the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=997.875s">And</a> that's been a real challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1000.658s">So</a> even if you look at enrollment, whatever, obviously the answer is to expand it, but expansion has been <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1007.579s">tough</a> because of the lack of people who want to apply for the relatively low paying jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1017.643s">And</a> it's also, it's not just the low pay, it's also the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1022.625s">Many</a> of our teachers have already worked a full day, so they're not particularly interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1026.667s">We've</a> tried students coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1028.689s">We</a> certainly bring in a certain amount of high school students, but they need to be overseen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1034.114s">So</a> absolutely what we would like is to be able to expand it to accommodate every family who needs it, because that's the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1041.642s">But</a> it is challenging.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1269.285s">It</a> sounds like we will need to be having a separate committee of the whole meeting for this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1275.306s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1437.439s">Special</a> Ed? <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1438.48s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1439.18s">Well,</a> I forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1440.101s">Do</a> you want me to get the list and take a look? <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1441.562s">We</a> used to have support services, and it fell under support services.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1447.906s">Yeah,</a> you want to just read off the titles, Dave?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1470.086s">So</a> we used to have one that was called support services and when they were shrunk to a more manageable level, that is not as clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1484.235s">I</a> mean, you could argue it in any number of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1488.218s">That's</a> why I said committee of the whole partly because I think that all the members will be interested in this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1743.489s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to ask Dave if he could give us an idea of what time you had in mind for these dates, the 4-27, 4-28, 4-29.<h2><a href="../2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w/2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w.html">Committee of the Whole - Columbus School Naming Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1.891s">First</a> of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8.757s">I</a> don't think we should limit our name only to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14.563s">I</a> think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21.249s">We</a> wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=25.7s">I</a> think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=33.867s">There's</a> a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=40.493s">I</a> will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=44.837s">there</a> will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=53.34s">And</a> that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=57.021s">And</a> of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=68.784s">And</a> I do think your suggestion hits that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=72.156s">Now,</a> as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=84.263s">Many</a> of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=91.648s">We</a> could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=97.951s">So</a> I want to mention, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=101.289s">right</a> now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=119.249s">The</a> other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=132.159s">And</a> I did read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=134.201s">If</a> I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=141.466s">A</a> little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=147.053s">opposed</a> to the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=150.276s">I</a> mean, and we know that there are far more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=155.179s">Some</a> of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=160.343s">We</a> did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=173.152s">So</a> I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=201.124s">Yes,</a> and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=208.206s">It's</a> just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=214.167s">So</a> if you can, that's a personal request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=216.508s">If</a> you don't want to, that's your option, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=222.869s">Anyway,</a> so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=230.971s">At</a> this point, I'll just give it as report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=232.913s">They'll</a> be all put into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=235.755s">And</a> if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=241.999s">I'm</a> at the it's at the will of the committee.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=638.152s">So</a> a couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=639.552s">Mayor,</a> like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=653.216s">And</a> I asked Peter if he would put them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=656.857s">I</a> think they're similar to yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=658.377s">There</a> may be one difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=662.032s">Because</a> I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=667.479s">I</a> think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=678.653s">us</a> all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=683.438s">No,</a> it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=684.359s">And</a> so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=688.303s">But</a> the six key talking points really covers the most important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=695.37s">Now,</a> I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=703.876s">And</a> my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=714.022s">We</a> actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Ruseau and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=726.986s">But</a> it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=732.228s">And</a> part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=739.531s">So</a> these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=746.313s">One</a> is how is the advisory committee chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=749.234s">And</a> by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=759.765s">and</a> not particularly complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=763.129s">But</a> point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=766.492s">Three,</a> once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=772.264s">Four,</a> what is the charge to the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=775.265s">What</a> are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=777.306s">Five</a> is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=780.426s">And</a> six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=787.409s">Those</a> are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=796.733s">So</a> that's just, I put that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=799.335s">I</a> know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1548.311s">I</a> would like to address one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1551.373s">Many</a> people are speaking about all the different things that the school committee faces, and that's absolutely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1558.537s">We</a> have a lot of work ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1561.559s">However,</a> and part of this is being brought about, well, you need more time to hear us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1569.033s">We</a> have heard strongly from the community, and I myself have gone and spoken to some members who are very anti the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1578.579s">And</a> it's very, very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1580.56s">But</a> to say you don't have enough time, well, frankly, we're a pretty dedicated bunch all across. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1587.164s">And</a> I don't think that once we get through <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1591.707s">the</a> process and work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1593.948s">And</a> there will be some things that I speak to, like removing one piece, we'll get to it later, off of a school committee onto a committee of the whole instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1605.912s">You</a> know, so I do, and the other thing which I think is key for me to say as the longest serving school committee member is, and when this first came up, I spoke to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1617.856s">Now,</a> when this first came up, I will tell you, and I've said to other people, I wasn't happy with the process, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1625.262s">Because</a> at that first meeting, I felt confident in that, yes, I did feel there was a reason to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1634.17s">You</a> must remember that there was in light of a very <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1638.133s">a</a> spring of great reckoning and understanding of what was going on in our world and the racism that exists that we all saw with our own eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1651.088s">And</a> there is a context to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1654.568s">But</a> 20 years ago, when we built the new schools, I can absolutely tell you that there was a discussion in the committee, in the Building the Future Committee of which I was part, about the naming of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1670.523s">And</a> at that time, we were well aware that there were people who would much prefer it not to be the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1681.029s">I've</a> kicked myself sometimes because I let that go, partially in deference to a community member who I had great respect for and who didn't want it to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1693.162s">But</a> it's been a recurring <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1698.328s">You</a> know, maybe you haven't heard it, but I have over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1704.191s">I've</a> heard it, I've had discussions down at the Columbus School with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1708.093s">So</a> it's not that this just popped up and there's been, it's not been part of our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1715.577s">It</a> has been particularly for parents whose children attend the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1721.881s">And</a> that certainly isn't to say that everybody agrees, but it's certainly been there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1737.013s">So</a> the time has to do with the timeline that she's suggesting is part of the discussion that we'll have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1746.54s">We're</a> sort of talking two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1749.162s">I</a> too, after I worked out my resolution, believes that it would be great to have more time, which is to say a number of weeks more to come to the conclusion of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1762.242s">I've</a> built in and will talk to my committee about saying that I think that once we put the advisory council together and they begin their work, that they are the ones who will need to be able to say to us, hey, we need eight more weeks, or we need 12 more weeks, or we think this has to be the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1781.687s">But</a> that's a discussion that as we work out the particulars of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1785.688s">The</a> other thing is the reality of it is, and we just have to say this, and it's just blunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1791.809s">When</a> people are saying they haven't been heard, we have heard them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1796.67s">But</a> unfortunately, we don't necessarily agree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1800.752s">We</a> are not agreeing to change, to not change the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1806.214s">So</a> people keep on saying, you haven't heard us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1809.615s">Well,</a> we are hearing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1811.316s">And</a> quite honestly, I mean, I had some great discussions and I was really moved at one point by one person who told me what Columbus Day meant in his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1822.14s">And</a> I listened and I heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1824.482s">I've</a> heard other people say we're erasing history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1827.164s">We're</a> still going to teach our kids about Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1830.126s">It</a> is part of our education strands. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1835.751s">It's</a> not like we're just saying, and Columbus had, hey, there were some things that were good about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1841.095s">What</a> we're saying is, is he, is this name the one we want to represent this educational facility in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1852.085s">You</a> have voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1855.54s">the</a> committee, six members plus the mayor, this community voted for us to do what we think is best. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1862.243s">This</a> is not an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1864.524s">It</a> is painful, it is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1866.905s">One</a> of my committee members said to me, you know, Paulette, the problem with you is you wanna make everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1871.648s">And</a> that's absolutely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1873.348s">I</a> don't wanna piss anybody off. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1875.369s">And</a> no matter what I do, I'm going to make some people unhappy in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1880.232s">I</a> am being true to myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1883.473s">I've</a> worked, spent hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1885.554s">And</a> by the way, those hours were not conflicting with the other work that I do, talking to administration, saying, hey, can we work on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1891.597s">Hey,</a> what about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1892.478s">Okay,</a> I've got lots of hours in my day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1896.02s">But</a> trying to say, how does this process work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1900.082s">And</a> is there a way that the process can help bring this community together? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1905.865s">I</a> listened on Monday when Mr. McKillop suggested that we start all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1912.31s">And</a> for a while back, I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1915.471s">I</a> was wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1917.351s">But</a> I came, thought deeply and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1920.331s">At</a> this point, we have had lots of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1924.112s">People</a> in Medford are aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1926.733s">I</a> walked my dog this afternoon with someone I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1929.953s">She's</a> not particularly involved at all in the politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1933.054s">I</a> said, wow, I've got a heavy meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1935.154s">And</a> she said, oh yeah, it's the Columbus naming issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1938.835s">People</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1940.635s">Anyway.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3233.909s">When</a> member Rousseau created the form, he had on his form that someone applying for the advisory council committee, sorry, would also be submitting a name on the same form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3247.2s">I</a> have severed the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3249.121s">I</a> have you apply for the advisory committee or you're putting in a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3254.105s">Anybody</a> who is a member of the advisory committee <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3257.899s">on</a> the advisory committee can certainly put in a name, but they're two different forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3262.964s">It'll</a> just be more easy to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3266.226s">Here's</a> the list of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3267.528s">Here's</a> the list who's applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3270.29s">The</a> other difference in our form is I also asked on the one for the advisory committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3278.357s">I</a> asked when they were available. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3281.459s">So</a> there's a line that says, you know, can you tell us when you're available? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3285.723s">Because</a> I think we need to know if people are only available one day a week, that might not be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3293.169s">If</a> they're only available between four and six on Tuesdays, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3297.331s">that</a> may be difficult, and so that's why I asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3301.553s">The</a> other thing is when I wrote mine, I put a statement in it as opposed to a question, and member Rousseau knows about this, a statement saying that if people needed interpretation services or computers, whatever, that that would be supplied. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3321.34s">So</a> it's a statement rather than asking them if they <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3324.761s">it's</a> just makes it clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3351.838s">Can</a> I ask the question differently, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3354.879s">Instead</a> of adding it on Member Ruseau's, could we just use mine instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3360.381s">Because</a> I've already written it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3362.422s">And</a> since Member Ruseau submitted the other one, I'd like to hear if he's, you know, these are my suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3371.725s">It</a> would just be easier unless there's a lot of controversy about it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3471.587s">So</a> instead of working from either resolution, can we work from the list of questions that either you or I put forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3478.869s">Because</a> that then is going to, we can, one of those is addressed in that list of what I said were the key questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3488.32s">Um,</a> so if we if we worked from the key questions, then we would be, then we would have the discussion about each of our different approaches.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6722.512s">Just</a> so you know, on this, as this differs from Paul's in just two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6729.477s">I</a> added the sentence about, are you related to the name you submitted? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6734.84s">And</a> I also asked that each name be submitted on a different form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6742.813s">Otherwise,</a> mine and Paul's are the same.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6791.435s">I</a> forgot to add that, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6793.115s">It</a> should be added.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7179.202s">On</a> mine, I have a separate paragraph devoted to the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7184.044s">Now,</a> the original intent was to have a very lengthy process with students being involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7190.908s">The</a> time frame makes it shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7193.459s">and</a> certainly will not be as we intended when the original motion was drawn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7203.324s">But</a> there is a piece that's dedicated to it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7268.7s">Yes,</a> so I think that there was a difference in Paul and mine about the date that the applications were due. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7276.645s">And</a> part of it is that there's a vacation week built in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7280.908s">So</a> he had them due on the Friday of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7287.452s">So</a> which, Paul, if I recall, originally it was April 26th, 24th, 23rd, right on yours? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7293.576s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7297.691s">I</a> pushed it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.395s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.715s">So</a> that's the Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7302.616s">So</a> that's the Friday of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7305.699s">And</a> that's usually the day when we're then getting our packets of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7311.905s">So</a> I gave more time, less time to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7316.129s">I</a> have it done on Friday, April 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7320.665s">which</a> does cut off time, but it's because of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7324.606s">I</a> wanted to make sure that our office staff had enough time to collect all the applications, to collect the names, and to prepare them to give them to us as appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7337.309s">So</a> that was the reason why Paul and I had a different time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7343.391s">I</a> just wanted to be clear on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7349.452s">April</a> 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7350.272s">So</a> in essence, people have four weeks to apply.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7361.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7365.514s">Again,</a> it just had to do with the vacation week issue.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7388.785s">You</a> could, I just didn't know who was gonna be, since it's vacation week, who was gonna be in the office and they need to be collated and sent out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7398.093s">So</a> you could, but just realize whatever office staff <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7403.97s">is</a> in the superintendent's office or whatever.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7416.613s">Wait,</a> say that again.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7448.755s">So</a> Mayor, Paul and I, and this is one of those key talking points that I mentioned to you earlier, we have a big difference between us on the process of what happens to the name submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7465.661s">I</a> have them all going, if we receive 50, I have all 50 going immediately to the advisory committee once it's formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7476.563s">Paul</a> has a process where we wheedle them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7481.744s">What</a> happens is we would, at our school committee meeting on April 26, which is what he designated, and Paul, if you wanna speak to this, because I'm speaking for you, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7492.126s">But</a> he had it that the school committee would wheedle down the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7498.129s">So</a> let's say we got 100, we would each pick four. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7501.511s">And</a> he has a fairly involved process where they're weighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7504.412s">And</a> I found that confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7506.613s">And</a> I thought that the whole intent of the advisory committee was, in fact, to vet the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7512.556s">I</a> did not feel that I could receive the names on a Friday, April 23, and in our Monday meeting, April 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7520.376s">be</a> willing or able to then only send to the committee my top four choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7528.339s">It's</a> a very significant difference on how we approach this question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7668.501s">Yeah,</a> just to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7670.542s">Or</a> we can set ourselves up for failure by receiving, if you're a number, Paul, of 300 on Friday afternoon, and expecting me without, I don't have any time to vet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7683.087s">And</a> on so what basis am I going from 300 to four? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7687.148s">It's</a> just not real. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7688.128s">The</a> reason you have the advisory committee is to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7691.47s">I</a> mean, part of it will be when they will go through and, you know, the first ones, they'll, you know, but that's not, if you're having us do that initial work selection without establishing what criteria we're using, it's a crapshoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7714.118s">And</a> I think that it undermines the whole process.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7863.875s">So</a> can you use mine, my wording since I worked it out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8480.339s">Yes,</a> um, so in my mind we're not erasing history we're changing a name to what might be a more appropriate name in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8490.772s">Columbus</a> will still be taught, like you said he was a famous navigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8495.282s">There's</a> much history there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8497.384s">It's</a> to be appreciated in its totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8501.769s">It</a> is part of the Massachusetts strands of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8505.934s">I</a> think it's both fourth and then again in middle school where students discuss Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8511.921s">So</a> it's not in any way a shape to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8515.084s">remove</a> Columbus from the curriculum or not to teach it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8519.207s">It</a> is a question of saying, what name do we want to put on this building that will embrace and bring our community together? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8532.336s">Unfortunately,</a> Columbus is very divisive, as you can see in this discussion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9020.322s">Member</a> Ruseau had that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9143.092s">I,</a> I think that's problematical Melanie, because so many people have already felt that they haven't had the opportunity to speak to now say that this may take us another three hours to work through the whole document. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9156.019s">So</a> I think the way the mayor's been feeding them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9159.741s">As</a> time-consuming as it is and how sometimes questions are being asked that we will answer, I think we just have to be short and say, we'll get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9170.509s">But</a> I think you might make a tough situation even more difficult if you shut down any ability to talk while the meeting is proceeding.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9188.592s">how</a> some people might perceive it, Melanie, and I know you're always open to hearing from her.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9330.381s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10850.519s">Yes,</a> Nadia. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10852.22s">The</a> question for me is, and I've said this all along, is there no one else that we could honor from the Italian community that might in fact bring a great deal of pride <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10872.313s">I</a> understand people have very different feelings about Columbus, but part of the issue is, is there any way to move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10884.922s">We</a> are saying we need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10888.225s">We</a> understand, and I think a lot of this meeting is because we want everybody to speak, but again, part of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10896.206s">the</a> need at some point is to say, is there anybody else? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10900.169s">Who</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10901.229s">And</a> we're trying to say, if you want a voice in this, apply to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10907.474s">We're</a> working out the nuts and bolts so that, and certainly all the work I did on the resolution was to make sure that no one person could slant the committee in such a way that a final name was predetermined. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10925.76s">Um,</a> so that's just a, you know, that's part of what I was looking at is to make sure the process was clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10933.369s">I</a> understand you don't like the back process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10935.591s">I</a> understand that it's painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10937.633s">I</a> hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10938.835s">But</a> going forward, how can we make sure that we are doing the best job? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10943.9s">And</a> I encourage you to please apply for the committee.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11344.765s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11347.808s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to mention that Ron Giovino has had his hand up for a long time, but he doesn't have one of the regular little hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11356.078s">So</a> just to make sure he's on your list.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11421.035s">Ron,</a> what's your address?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11661.784s">Yes,</a> I think people should also only have one last chance to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11666.728s">I</a> think that we've allowed ample opportunity for people to, you know, and many people have spoken several times and, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11676.354s">So</a> I think that we've been more than generous with time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11680.856s">If</a> there's people who haven't spoken, they should get a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11685.399s">But</a> we're getting tired and the commentary is dissolving.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11713.16s">So</a> one of the questions is I've seen principal K here and some level of question was around the Columbus participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11724.388s">And</a> I wondered if we should, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11729.497s">Talk</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11731.098s">Paul</a> and I do have the Columbus participation in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11736.582s">You</a> know, it is part of the bigger question of who's going to be on the advisory council, membership on the advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11745.408s">Perhaps,</a> you know, when you have multiple devices and then they close on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11755.536s">This</a> one's Paul's, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11758.74s">Anyway,</a> would that be acceptable? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11762.884s">Mayor,</a> can I talk about that for a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11766.207s">Yes,</a> please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11767.048s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11768.889s">First,</a> I have a paragraph about participation by the Columbus School staff and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11773.843s">And</a> it's a separate paragraph says in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11781.771s">The</a> school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11789.039s">Additionally,</a> student input is highly desirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11792.62s">And</a> if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11804.765s">The</a> goal of both staff and student input is to come up with three to five names to submit for consideration to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11813.488s">The</a> names will be submitted by April 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11816.79s">So</a> we're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11818.257s">to</a> the principal, there's only four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11824.662s">We</a> had originally envisioned a much greater, longer period where we were gonna get student education and input. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11834.212s">Therefore,</a> in recognition of that, I'm saying, oh my gosh, you know, principal, I don't know what you're going to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11842.999s">And</a> I don't, I understand to me, it's not, this is one of the problems with a very tight timeline, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11849.865s">It's</a> not giving a great opportunity for student input. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11856.229s">Furthermore,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11859.747s">the</a> principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11866.171s">And</a> then I have, or appointed by the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11868.812s">I</a> didn't know which way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11869.933s">I</a> wanted committee input and I wanted the principal's input.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11915.296s">overall</a> intent, Columbus participation, the overall intent was that we originally said we wanted some student participation, and we were recognizing that the Columbus family if you would, including staff members should have some role. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11939.253s">Member</a> Ruseau will speak to this, but he identified six members as being on the advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11945.939s">I</a> thought that was a lot to ask for six members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11950.122s">I'm</a> suggesting that the school have an internal process, however way they want to do it, to collect names that they want to submit, hopefully with some student input, but I don't know if the time allows, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11962.573s">and</a> that there would be three members from the Columbus community, and that is the staff, okay, that would serve on the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11974.361s">And</a> they would be elected either by their peers or appointed by the principal, depending on what we decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11982.006s">So</a> that was my thinking.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11996.644s">Right,</a> but that was less than the six people that Member Ruseau suggested.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12138.197s">Mayor,</a> can I just, one thing, Paul, I just don't know, and when Kathy can, Principal Kaye can advise us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12150.366s">I</a> just don't know with teachers being at the end of the school year, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12154.329s">and</a> it's such a busy time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12155.81s">A</a> part of it was I was trying to lessen the obligation, even though I totally understand they may be fully invested or want to be invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12165.017s">This</a> is part, you know, this is why I've said from the outset, oh my gosh, I've got a problem with the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12171.743s">It's</a> really tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12172.924s">We're</a> not being able to achieve some of our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12175.906s">So,</a> you know, that's my concern.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12295.976s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12302.105s">For</a> me, Principal Kaye, what I really want to be is respectful to the time, the limitations of time that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12311.552s">I</a> wanted to make sure that there was some place where your school was represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12316.556s">I</a> personally understand completely that there may, you know, doing a big school project just doesn't necessarily make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12325.903s">unfortunately,</a> right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12328.005s">So</a> if you thought that, you know, if it was making everybody aware that they could submit names from your school and making, you know, that maybe would be what's really possible right at this point, making forms available, letting kids know, you know, whatever, that might be just, you know, what's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12351.725s">And</a> if the, do you think that, so originally I think it was that you and, you know, there were five members all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12361.052s">I</a> suspect strongly there'll be some interest so that you'll be able to have staff members who will want to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12369.838s">Am</a> I correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12391.7s">Did</a> you see those though as members of the advisory committee?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12759.147s">So</a> Dr. Kaye? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12760.908s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12761.668s">Are</a> you saying that it would be better for the school not to submit names specifically from the school?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12789.877s">Okay,</a> so if you look at the paragraph that I wrote, which is on the screen, if we take away in the first large paragraph, if we take away the last sentence, the goal of both the staff and student input is to come up with three to five names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12807.547s">If</a> we just take that out, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12810.31s">Okay,</a> remove that, then you have in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school, the school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues oh um. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12825.905s">Yeah,</a> no, okay, that doesn't work.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12865.645s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12866.526s">So</a> my next sentence is, additionally, student input is highly desirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12871.007s">And</a> if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12880.33s">Yes,</a> that would work for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12881.823s">And</a> then the last sentence to that paragraph is further the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers or appointed by the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12892.828s">And</a> I have a question mark there because I don't know which is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12895.67s">I</a> don't know whether you prefer to say that you'll appoint them or whether you say, oh yeah, doing a vote is the better way.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12913.233s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12914.114s">So</a> we'll take about that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.08s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.821s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12928.342s">Now,</a> again, that's what I'm kind of suggesting to working through from what I heard Jenny say and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12933.485s">Jenny,</a> does that meet your?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12989.83s">Do</a> you think there should be more than the three representatives, or do you think that's a realistic number?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13025.887s">So</a> why don't we just put the principal and as well as two to four staff members, and we can come back to that piece after we figure out the other members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13035.83s">That</a> works for me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13047.332s">Yeah,</a> we can revisit it if it's too large.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13109.4s">You</a> can take off the CCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13113.003s">I</a> use that only because it was an easy way for students to be elected by their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13119.388s">And</a> so that's why I limited it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13122.711s">And</a> also because I know that they're a service organization interested in community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13131.719s">Again,</a> I'm just throwing out some of these things by saying there is having a high school student rep on any committee that we have is, I think, an appropriate thing to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13143.868s">I'm</a> absolutely fine with however people want to amend it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13203.319s">slot</a> that we want to may take a lot more time than, I mean, maybe there's a lot more interest than... So Mayor, that's why I designated the CCSR because they have, you know, meetings and they have, you know, it's just organizationally, it's a really easy way that kids can get together and vote and say who's from Columbus, who's interested.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13390.99s">Member</a> Graham, while they're trying to figure that out, bullet one and two essentially are the same and need to be condensed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13691.616s">Well,</a> why don't we put, let's work through each of the lines and then figure out how many it comes up to, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13699.541s">The</a> number one said the up to four names are, so it says the two names selected from the Columbus School and Principal Kathy Kay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13712.148s">So</a> we had put the up to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13718.28s">individuals</a> selected from the, it should say up to four individuals, not names, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13727.131s">Thank</a> you for doing this, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13729.493s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13742.358s">So</a> on number two, it says each school committee member will select a member of the advisory committee from the valid applications received and will state the names publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13754.024s">In</a> the event that an application is selected by more than one school committee member, the members will continue to name applicants until a total of seven advisory committee members have been named. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13763.612s">Now</a> that was a member Ruseau had done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13767.515s">He</a> had suggested that every school committee select two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13771.679s">That</a> put together a committee of 14 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13775.542s">I</a> was concerned about the overall size. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13778.465s">The</a> process is the same that we each name <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13781.247s">One,</a> so we can look once we sort of figure out the total number of people, we can decide whether it should be one person or two people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13794.313s">The</a> next thought to any thought to allow.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14036.37s">So</a> mayor.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14040.874s">So</a> again, I have two different committee members who have very different feelings about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14052.217s">One</a> wants each of us to pick two, and one wants everything to be done by lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14061.019s">I</a> was looking for a middle road because I <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14067.905s">The</a> and to me the middle road and was do three by lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14072.209s">So</a> there was some totally random piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14075.051s">Okay,</a> and And then do have each of the committee members pick one To be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14084.38s">I'm</a> very open to whatever the majority of the committee wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14088.143s">I'm</a> not stuck on any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14089.824s">I</a> just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14091.045s">explain</a> where I was coming from and knowing Kathy had already said to me, I think everybody should be by lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14097.788s">And</a> I knew what Paul said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14099.569s">So</a> I was trying to bring everything together to a middle place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14103.811s">I</a> personally believe that when it says select, if we decide that part of that selection should be by lottery, I'm not uncomfortable with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14112.095s">But</a> clearly I didn't say we should select the whole committee to try and bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14123.7s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14124.06s">Paul,</a> can you go along with any piece of the, can you go along with three lotteries?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14156.269s">I</a> think I'm looking to bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14158.449s">So</a> Mm. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14163.711s">Member</a> Graham.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14479.231s">How</a> does the administration feel about that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14802.521s">I</a> guess, yeah, I need, I need you to say that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14806.784s">Um,</a> I'm troubled because I think that we as school committee members do, um, uh, have the ability to pick a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14815.991s">And</a> I think that we'll pick a person that will each have a criteria, um, that will not be the same, um, you know, uh, necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14825.777s">Um,</a> but that's why there's seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14828.679s">Um,</a> you know, uh,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14880.337s">And</a> what if we don't like the committee that the superintendent or her designee comes up with? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14885.855s">I</a> mean, that's the problem.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14904.079s">Well,</a> I'm open to hearing my colleagues, if everybody thinks that's gonna work, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14912.498s">Kathy,</a> how do you feel about that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14966.314s">So</a> I guess we just have to ask a superintendent, is that something which is comfortable for you?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15443.356s">I</a> think you can just go ahead and do that, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15445.778s">We</a> don't need a motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16699.518s">So</a> the answer simply is by statute, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16703.106s">The</a> naming of school buildings belongs to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16707.208s">The</a> responsibility belongs to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16710.59s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17113.902s">Yeah,</a> I think it's inappropriate to single out a school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17118.586s">And</a> I just, I think it's appropriate not to let that comment continue.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17706.872s">Why</a> don't you go say the individual selected from the Columbus School and then parentheses say up to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17714.321s">Principal</a> Kathy Kay and the one MHA student will be announced.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17919.475s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17923.517s">So</a> I would say the individuals, and instead of saying up to four, let's say up to three selected from the Columbus School staff, Principal Kathy Kaye, so that's four from the Columbus School, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17938.311s">one</a> Medford High School student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17940.593s">If</a> we're saying that we're each gonna pick two, so we're up to five and two would be, 14 would be 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17948.961s">Then</a> the chair would be number 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17953.665s">And</a> the member from the historical commission is ex officio non-voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17962.423s">So</a> I have 20 voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17964.063s">Now</a> the question is whether we're gonna have those three selected by lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17970.365s">That</a> was in direct response to Kathy's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17976.926s">You</a> know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18359.814s">Mayor,</a> you've already got, you've got five from number one, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18365.098s">You've</a> got up to, up to, okay, up to three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18370.503s">Five,</a> so you've got five people in number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18373.225s">If</a> we each pick two, that's four.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18379.029s">No,</a> no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18398.778s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18568.641s">Okay,</a> so you, so the chair would be chosen by the mayor before the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18592.131s">You</a> know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18646.867s">I'm</a> okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18647.667s">I</a> think I would say chair or co-chairs.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18653.499s">Okay,</a> I just, and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18657.82s">However</a> you wanna do it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18668.604s">Well,</a> I was giving the responsibility to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18674.686s">We</a> could say that the person that she picks, since we're each picking two, that one of her picks will be <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18682.415s">for</a> the chair or co-chairs.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18693.882s">Yeah,</a> but it doesn't necessarily, in terms of the voting, it doesn't necessarily matter.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18709.03s">So</a> part of the question is we're also asking whether they're gonna <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18712.688s">you</a> know, when we get to the process of how many names they're gonna give us, you know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18727.693s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18762.245s">And</a> the only problem with that, I mean, it definitely works, but who's organizing that first meeting then? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18768.368s">Who's</a> sending out the notices? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18772.649s">That's</a> what the problem is if you have the committee pick their own, if you have the advisory committee pick their own leadership, it starts it all out and how long does it take to get to that decision?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18869.857s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18872.238s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18873.999s">So</a> the reason why I originally said the mayor will appoint was because I wanted the mayor to do some legwork in advance of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18880.6s">this</a> to search out people who would be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18886.625s">And</a> so that she would know who the chair was gonna be rather than leaving it up to who applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18893.89s">I</a> mean, I needed, I'm thinking when we had advisory committees before, for example, for building the schools, the mayor sought out people to be chairs and appointed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18910.922s">I</a> will, by the way, tell you that this committee is larger than the building the future committees were. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18922.927s">Nobody's</a> amused by that, I guess.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18970.685s">Do</a> we need, are we keeping in the three additional names by lottery, just? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18976.948s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18977.829s">Yes,</a> okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18993.557s">Okay,</a> and the chair is a voting member, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18997.339s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18998.735s">And</a> the historical person, I was really hoping, I put it in your lap, Mayor, because I just thought that you would be a good point person for reaching out to the historical society and asking, we're going to need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19014.849s">The</a> advisory committee is going to need help looking into the history of some of the people that are suggested.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19045.895s">And</a> potentially, since they're non-voting members, it could be more than one.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19105.352s">Paul</a> had that in.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19107.333s">I</a> did not have it in mine, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19109.451s">You</a> could add that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19117.813s">I</a> think it's too big, but that's.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19180.763s">We</a> have to look at this again in light of our other discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19191.107s">So</a> change up to four, up to three staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19198.93s">Yes,</a> that's right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19242.721s">I</a> just think that, yeah, I think we have to be really realistic.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19304.264s">No,</a> this is just the work of the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19307.145s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19309.987s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19312.782s">Okay,</a> for number two, I think it's important that there, it's very possible that there will be people who are not aware of the letters that we've received and the depth of angst. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19328.969s">So</a> for that reason, I wanted them to have access in a file to the letters so they could understand what kind of letters we've read, we've gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19341.519s">So</a> they don't have to read them, but I just want to say that they have access to them so they can understand what the discussion has been so far.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19358.735s">OK,</a> does anybody object to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.099s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.86s">OK,</a> how about number three?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19380.11s">Okay,</a> now there's a crucial point here, and this is one of the key talking points that I mentioned right at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19392.881s">There</a> are two different ways we could go about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19395.962s">Paul</a> suggested that the advisory council go all the way down to the single last name, they give a presentation, and the school committee votes to confirm it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19408.947s">And</a> frankly, he had that all done on the same night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19413.698s">I</a> say that the advisory committee gives the school committee three names and the school committee then at a subsequent meeting, I don't think it should happen at the same meeting, that we pick one of the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19433.409s">The</a> arguments pro and against are, if we have the advisory committee pick the final name and then we just rubber stamp it, in many ways I feel like we're giving up our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19447.173s">However,</a> I realize that others will have a different opinion about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19451.074s">But</a> it's a clear, we have to make a decision about how we're gonna proceed on that particular point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19592.486s">Well,</a> Paul, if you put it in those terms, I think that we have the responsibility to pick from three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19599.551s">And</a> I would suggest that it would be OK with me if the advisory committee weighted them or numbered them or chose not to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19608.377s">We</a> gave it to those equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19610.398s">But</a> if you put it in those terms, then I don't see how we can choose not to.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19795.902s">Yes,</a> so my concern when you get down to two names is that it becomes polarizing again, right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19803.164s">So</a> I love the idea of involving the kids and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19808.726s">There</a> is a time factor for all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19812.208s">But</a> I really would suggest that we might even have the kids go from three names to two names, or we're adding another process here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19822.884s">but</a> that's why you don't pick two names is because you have one Italian American and one black American, and there you are with your polarization. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19832.452s">So</a> that's why I said three, up to three, I said up to three, somewhere along the line.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20198.922s">So</a> it should be, we're chosen since there's gonna be more than one? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20204.123s">We're</a> chosen, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20205.363s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20229.533s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20230.534s">Mayor,</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20231.855s">I'm</a> really concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20232.995s">I</a> mean, there's a whole lot of me which thinks that this work ought to happen in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20239.816s">and</a> a temporary name should be given to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20241.977s">I</a> mean, you know, I guess the way that I would put is maybe put another line, if the advisory committee concludes or if a majority of the advisory committee concludes that they cannot complete this work in the timeframe specified, that they come before the school committee or that they communicate <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20268.205s">this</a> to the school committee with a suggested new timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20273.928s">How's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20280.21s">Now,</a> that would take care of the concern that I personally have that it's too much work and too little time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20427.814s">I</a> thought we just talked about that but then we did withdraw right here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21155.013s">It's</a> ludicrous to say that we can't change the date of the original motion to say that you know that if they need more time we'll give them another month and they can the Columbus can stay the Columbus for another month. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21171.528s">I</a> mean <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21173.129s">As</a> many have said, we're during a pandemic, all the other timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21177.23s">If</a> you actually go back and read the minutes, and there is probably a problem with the minutes, but it doesn't reference the whole, it just says the name of the Columbus will change, and it doesn't put the date on what we actually voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21188.373s">And</a> I went back and read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21189.793s">Now</a> the intent was clear, but I'm just saying, Paul, to hang your hat on and saying, you know, that's your personal thing that it has to change on July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21199.767s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21200.488s">There's</a> nothing in the world that says it can't change on August 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21206.291s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21207.232s">There's</a> just nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21208.953s">And,</a> you know, if you want to avoid the temporary date, I mean, somewhere along the line, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21216.719s">I</a> think we've been working really well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21218.94s">We've</a> got different opinions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21220.9s">I</a> mean, frankly, I'd like to say December 1st, because I think December 1st would be much more of a process of bringing kids in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21228.563s">To</a> me, there's a rush here, which is still really uncomfortable, but I need to ask you to move off that, oh my God, the world is gonna end on July 1st if we don't change the name of the Columbus School.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21764.093s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21766.094s">And</a> so that we just for an extra month, it would be called Columbus for an extra month. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.279s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.939s">Now,</a> if that is so unacceptable to my colleagues, then I would strongly vote for changing it to the South Medford Elementary School and not leaving it as an open, because I don't want that to become the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21785.575s">I</a> think, to me, it seems silly to have an interim name for just one month.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21825.518s">We'll</a> choose the temporary name.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21859.164s">No,</a> that they have to give us a recommendation on July 31st.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21864.17s">Period.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21875.558s">When</a> you say after that we will pick a name you're opening a whole new kettle of fish.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21898.598s">There</a> is, the final date is July 31st, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21903.742s">And</a> what if they just don't?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21911.126s">I</a> mean, if that happens- Three recommendations to us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21956.527s">I</a> think that then in the off chance the school committee will, the school will be called the South Medford Elementary School until a name is decided upon.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22042.392s">Anybody</a> planning on going on summer vacation this summer?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22307.177s">Mayor,</a> I need to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22309.737s">We</a> also haven't covered the first part of this, page one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22314.598s">So</a> our work is not done at the end of this page. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22317.618s">And</a> there are more people that would like to speak.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22331.772s">No,</a> to keep it not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22335.073s">I</a> think we should finish this sentence after July 31st, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22338.235s">Period.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22559.068s">Uh,</a> so, um, I of course think this works just fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22577.893s">So</a> mine is a little different from Paul's Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22580.494s">I</a> made yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22581.554s">I</a> made it shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22583.115s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22584.335s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22586.551s">I</a> added the most significant thing is a charge to the advisory committee where it says, I don't know how that just happened.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22606.104s">The</a> way that we charge is the advisory committee with the task of vetting names submitted for consideration and weighing the relative strength of submissions against a criteria they will develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22617.498s">The</a> criteria will include but not be limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22625.928s">the</a> ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22634.013s">Furthermore,</a> the advisory committee is charged with narrowing the field of names to three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22641.957s">And</a> then at that point where it says these final names, and it says either, whatever, take out that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22656.239s">So</a> take out number B. The final exams will be presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22670.422s">So,</a> Jenny, also the subset of A. Yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22717.827s">So</a> there is one difference, or at least one that I remember explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22723.31s">Member</a> Ruseau, you had that the names of Medford schools were named after an individual and we want to continue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22731.074s">I</a> do not specify that also because not all the schools were named after an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22735.936s">Also</a> because maybe I almost anticipated that someone might <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22742.137s">put</a> in the name Mystic and I didn't want to not include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22746.278s">So</a> I've not defined that and I think that for me, I'd rather have it open.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22768.311s">I</a> don't, because when you say Medford, Medford High School.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22784.256s">Because</a> I interpreted it differently.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22797.721s">I</a> mean, obviously- That's not true, and it hasn't always been true in the past.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22807.106s">I</a> mean, I feel like- Does Mystic count as a connection to Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22810.488s">Is</a> that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22811.549s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22812.429s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22813.43s">So</a> I was just seeing it just as only, but it does mean that nobody can put in Da Vinci.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22822.034s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22824.315s">I</a> kind of like Da Vinci. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22827.426s">Everything's</a> named after him.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22832.529s">Galileo.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22835.671s">Mr.</a> Galileo, are you sure you just, you know, if we just now put it, then we can see what they come up with.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22867.324s">Melanie,</a> in the charge, I wrote that the committee will come up with what they're measuring names against. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22877.946s">And</a> one of the measurements is the connection to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22881.847s">So</a> it is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22885.988s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22908.045s">Okay,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22914.13s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22915.23s">This</a> really comes to my discussion with Rick Orlando, who co-chaired the Building the Future Committee when we built the new. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22923.252s">He</a> said the first thing that was really important is for the committee to come up with the criteria that they're going to measure their decisions against so that they've got some agreed standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22935.194s">And</a> he said that was really probably the most important thing that they did in making it flow so easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22940.615s">So</a> I thought that was important.<h2><a href="../2021-03-10_ncGsNyIdjFk/2021-03-10_ncGsNyIdjFk.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2729.055s">Would</a> every school have a pilot program?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2766.538s">Right,</a> and the goal would be to adopt the program K to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2772.639s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2773.86s">Okay,</a> I mean, I certainly understand that as a parent who might have a, you know, second grader, they're counting and saying, oh, that's not gonna be made it, you know, for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2785.582s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2786.622s">I'm</a> walking back a little bit and say, well, there'll be something tried in your school, but that's always the very hard part as our, <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2793.299s">as</a> we look at rollouts for new curriculum.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3386.09s">So</a> they give it to you once for free because, and then they hope you get 40,000 plus.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4283.949s">And</a> I, yeah.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4581.211s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4583.212s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4584.975s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4586.275s">Any</a> other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4589.517s">If</a> not, I would entertain a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4596.859s">Motion</a> to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4598.319s">Second.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5691.274s">Hi,</a> so this is a very extensive, it was an extensive meeting, so I'm going to condense the minutes for the purpose of just sort of summarizing the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5702.223s">We</a> had two presentations that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5704.884s">The</a> first was from Molly Leighton, director of our technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5709.984s">She</a> spoke to the curriculum and what's covered in each of the grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5715.385s">She</a> also spoke to questions like, what are her future goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5722.527s">She</a> wants to expand the library makerspace, expansion of student tech help desks, bring girls who code club <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5731.384s">Medford</a> Public Schools and build course pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5735.226s">Full-time</a> librarians in all schools with certified school librarian tech integration leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5742.408s">She</a> did note that the department is light. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5746.73s">Part</a> of that, of course, is due to the tragic death of a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5756.289s">One</a> of the things that she also spoke of about was that computer skills, it's not just the computer classes, but also embedding skills within the curriculum across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5773.398s">So</a> it's not a standalone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5777.5s">So</a> example, writing on the computer, for example, using a slideshow to present a science project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5783.598s">Tech</a> teachers had to teach proficiently with keyboards for MCAS, use it throughout the day, and now extremely important that everyone has a Chromebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5792.763s">So</a> member Graham asked about a new curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.186s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.386s">Layden</a> said, I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5799.807s">So</a> this year and last year, we have supported staff and students how to use Google Classrooms, emails, online research tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5807.371s">Some</a> of those things will continue to evolve depending on needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5811.073s">More</a> a skill set than a set curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.214s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.434s">Layden</a> talked about the influx of tech funding, which of course was a positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5826.637s">And</a> I asked about how do we support our classroom teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5829.838s">Are</a> we doing enough to support our teachers in areas they don't feel comfortable with Google Classroom, et cetera? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.382s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.582s">Layden</a> responded that library and tech teachers work hand in hand with classmates, teachers reinforcing and assisting when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5850.468s">Again,</a> she went back and talked about the library staff is stretched thin and this of course has ramifications for what they can accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5861.915s">So</a> I would sum that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5866.061s">I</a> asked about the other things that we need as a committee to be aware of for budget requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5872.784s">And</a> she said, the ordered Chrome tables for kindergarten finally arrived, as did the document cameras for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5879.808s">So</a> those were very delayed in arriving, but they're finally here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5883.85s">Instructional</a> labs will need upgrading for coding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5887.712s">We</a> would look to build in a replacement budget for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5893.618s">Okay,</a> the next presentation was by Dr. Riccadeli, who spoke to us about the world language curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5902.624s">Much</a> of this discussion really focused on the middle school level and whether French should be added as an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5913.571s">There's</a> a great deal of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5915.333s">I</a> think one of the points which, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5917.87s">I</a> saw some level of where it wasn't fully decided as Dr. Riccadeli was suggesting that it would start off with grade six next year to offer French. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5931.359s">She</a> suggested that we have staff who's already able to speak French, but I know that there was also expressed by member Graham, any interest in having that extended at least into grade seven and possibly grade eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5949.025s">We</a> adjourned at 530.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6705.305s">So</a> I always think that we had a discussion about sort of two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6710.168s">One</a> was the front entrance and doing that with a sign and nice, as our community member presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6720.793s">The</a> other was the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6725.986s">looking</a> into a banner that might go along the whole front of the building, just to be, add a little bit more sparkle, if you would, a little bit more, you know, interest in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6739.869s">I</a> don't think right now we were getting to the point where it was just final, this is what we would do, but because there were cost concerns, like how much is a banner? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6749.03s">I</a> think that the, you know, from my point of view, I was definitely interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6753.991s">making</a> the front of the school clear, clear cut, name, nice, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6760.254s">But</a> if the banner is a not too expensive way of also bringing some excitement to the building, I think we should look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6772.54s">So</a> just to get a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6773.46s">Yes,</a> just to get a price, just to have an understanding of what we're talking about.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7006.089s">Yes,</a> there were four altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7008.95s">The</a> first one I'm going to read has to do with MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7013.35s">It</a> was submitted by Eileen Manziel of 42 Winter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7017.791s">She</a> writes, question, what are the new dates for MCAS testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7021.772s">Are</a> parents still able to opt out their child children if they so choose? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7026.153s">Sincerely,</a> Eileen Manziel.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7156.892s">Galusi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7158.487s">Next</a> email, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7161.188s">So</a> there are three more emails regarding the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7167.69s">Mayor,</a> do you wish me to read them now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7185.954s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7189.083s">what</a> your preference is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7190.803s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7192.164s">So,</a> and I'll keep on checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7194.584s">Thank</a> you very much, Member Van der Kloot.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8456.784s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8457.724s">Yes,</a> Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8459.145s">So</a> I do need to let you know that we received a letter on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8463.927s">I</a> can hold it until the presentation, if that would be preferable.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10547.781s">No,</a> I just, these were just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10550.583s">I</a> really, really liked seeing them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12318.142s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12320.102s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12321.083s">Please</a> let me know if my audio starts going bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12323.803s">I</a> noted tonight we've had more audio problems than usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12327.264s">So</a> let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12328.224s">I</a> am reading, received a letter to the school committee account from a parent, Adrianne Preby. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12337.166s">I'm</a> going to paraphrase it since many of the things were answered, but I think it's important for <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12342.608s">you</a> to hear her viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12344.769s">She</a> says, my name is Adrienne Preby of 61 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12348.492s">I</a> sent this to school administrators but did not receive a reply, so I'm sending it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12353.075s">The</a> decision to take away a family's choice in switching back and forth from hybrid to remote as they feel is safest for them due to the ever-shifting nature of COVID case counts as a clear breach of trust of families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12365.124s">How</a> exactly do you intend to enforce this policy after March 18th? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12370.037s">She</a> does ask whether we have considered asking a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12374.078s">I</a> think most importantly, though, the thing I want to mention is she says, additionally, all communications about this new policy only add that families will be able to remain fully remote as an afterthought, barely emphasizing this crucial fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12391.621s">And</a> she feels that this is trying to pressure families into choosing the in-person learning model. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12396.178s">So</a> I'm not certain, I don't, I know what exactly, you know, whether that was the last thing said or the first, but I just wanna make it clear that to parents that they can choose the remote model and we're anticipating that they could stay in the remote model to the end of this year, is that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12419.68s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12476.84s">Yeah,</a> so I really think that what she's saying is that because maybe in our communication, she saw the emphasis on yes, you can stay fully remote as maybe not front and center at the beginning.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12551.005s">I'm</a> just relaying that the parent feels that this change is not something she's happy with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12557.628s">And</a> she did not feel that it was emphasized that she could stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12561.169s">That's</a> all I'm saying.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12563.43s">It's</a> not a point of- Her words, not mine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13074.543s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.144s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.404s">So</a> the question is, um, uh, I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13080.207s">Uh,</a> I'd like to be able to wave them all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13083.229s">What's</a> the financial impact and how are we going to cover the loss?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13145.673s">Okay,</a> that's, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13150.836s">I</a> make a motion to approve the recommendation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13450.674s">So</a> first, I do want to, we held off some letters from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13456.098s">And</a> so I do want to comment on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13458.579s">However,</a> before I read those, I'm just going to say, I understood the purposes of putting the, that member Rousseau told me was that his purpose was to send his resolution to the committee of the whole on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13471.407s">And</a> so I submitted mine as well, so that it would go to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13476.68s">Resolutions</a> that are put forth just to explain to our viewers are to work out, hammer out a procedure for an advisory council and also a timeline for the renaming of the Columbus School, which was voted on back in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13497.255s">They</a> are very lengthy because there are many important issues in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13504.528s">in</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13505.789s">So</a> my intent was that it was not going to be discussed line by line tonight, but that I wanted everybody to get a chance to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13514.814s">I</a> do have great concerns about the timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13517.696s">I</a> mentioned that tonight, but I'm sure we'll be talking about that on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13522.678s">Now,</a> we received some letters regarding the Columbus issue <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13530.709s">I'm</a> going to, the first one received was from Betsy Lister and long time resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13547.157s">I</a> thought I saw Betsy on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13548.858s">She</a> actually did not put her address on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13552.1s">Is</a> Betsy on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13558.994s">She</a> is a long time, four decades, Medford resident, a business owner in town for over 20 years.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13575.958s">Member</a> Vidikul, how many emails do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13579.059s">I</a> think there's three now, but another one on a different topic has come in.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13586.882s">Okay,</a> to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13588.223s">I've</a> been a long time, four decades, Medford resident, business owner in town for over 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13593.046s">I'm</a> a past president of what was known as the Salem Street Business Association for three years, a past board member of Temple Shalom here in the city, and my son went to the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13603.672s">The</a> direction I see the city going in is one that will hold terrible consequences for the children and grandchildren of future generations, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13610.956s">of</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13611.997s">This</a> Marxist-communistic leftist agenda that's being forced down the throats of parents and children is heinous, contains so much hatred and racial divide, it's out and outright despicable and has no business in the city, never mind the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13627.151s">Why</a> on earth are children not being taught the important things that will get them through life? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13631.455s">Why</a> are they being indoctrinated into a narrative that's full of hate and divides people by color and social status? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13637.58s">Why</a> are they being taught about BLM and Antifa? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13641.181s">Why</a> not teach them our history as it happens so that they will know not to repeat it in the future to be learning from the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13647.903s">All</a> men are created equal, says the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13651.524s">So</a> that's what we should be taught in school, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13654.545s">Not</a> divide by skin color or ethnic background. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13656.965s">They</a> are all children and children love unless they are taught otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13660.706s">And</a> teaching hatred in school has no business <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13664.653s">being</a> there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13665.773s">Teach</a> the children they are all equal and to love one another and their neighbors, not to put a line of division between themselves and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13673.135s">I'm</a> disgusted with the new rev, that and they all need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13676.696s">In</a> fact, I'm thinking the entire school committee needs to be dissolved immediately because it's harming the children by dividing the community unnecessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13684.278s">We're</a> better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13685.459s">I</a> doubt that the majority of Medford parents want their children brought up with Marxist beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13690.2s">We</a> already know that academia consists of 98% liberals and the rest conservatives, so that should be addressed as well so that children's minds are not poisoned any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13699.488s">It's</a> a very long letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13703.511s">Sorry,</a> that was my own comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13705.512s">Recently,</a> I heard an audio clip of an eighth grade class with their teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13708.815s">He</a> asked them if they knew who Helen Keller was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13711.257s">The</a> response ranged from a man and a German spy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13714.72s">Only</a> one child in the entire classroom said, oh, that was <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13718.792s">that</a> blind person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13719.873s">By</a> the way, she's not referring to a Medford classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13723.476s">The</a> teacher then required if any of the children knew who Hitler was and they were clueless, no idea, and couldn't respond at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13730.142s">Imagine</a> not knowing who Hitler was in the eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13733.245s">And</a> finally, he asked, do you know what D-Day is? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13736.949s">And</a> the answer was a rapper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13739.022s">Think</a> about that for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13740.462s">What</a> are our kids being taught? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13742.183s">Items</a> of importance or a leftist Marxist agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13745.804s">I'm</a> not a perfect person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13747.145s">I've</a> sinned in my life and I have enough sense to know what I'm seeing being pushed through in Medford schools is just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13753.066s">And</a> although I'm not a Christian, I believe that most parents would agree that what's being taught in the Medford school system doesn't go along with their Christian or Judaic values. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13761.929s">Seems</a> the leftist took God out of the schools to shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13766.348s">And</a> as for the Columbus School renaming goes, there's no reason at all to change the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13770.23s">I</a> know Andrea Bocelli is quite the performer, but he means nothing to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13774.411s">Nor</a> do I think who he is makes any sense to plaster his name on an educational building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13778.693s">This</a> is not Disney, nor is it Hollywood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13780.414s">And</a> the name Columbus has served the school very well for decades upon decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13784.276s">For</a> all of his sins, he's the reason most of us are here for crying out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13787.517s">This</a> is the senseless and waste our time and poses a distraction to the real issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13792.079s">What's</a> being taught to the children in the direction that the city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13796.854s">We</a> have elected a mayor who has turned her back on the people who elected her and chooses to do her personal bidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13805.821s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13807.602s">You</a> know, there's a level of, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13813.878s">Not</a> on our own political stance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13815.26s">Take</a> a knee for BLM, but do not support your own police. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13818.342s">Hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13819.403s">How</a> many want to see this divide that's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13821.445s">I</a> doubt not the majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13822.666s">Hell,</a> if I'm wrong, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13824.228s">I</a> was the support the police rally, and when you have children screaming, blank the police, and creating a scene and spewing hatred everywhere, it was disgusting, and everybody was shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13835.078s">These</a> were schoolchildren telling us to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13838.075s">yeah,</a> and ourselves and the police and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13840.88s">I</a> got hit off the head with a sign by a teenager who teaches these kids this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13846.73s">Common</a> sense has left the city and needs to be brought back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13850.222s">If</a> we don't teach our true history as it was, the kids will go back thinking D-Day is a rapper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13855.406s">Stop</a> destroying the city's monuments and institutions by bringing a divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13859.63s">Rather</a> instead, take a step back and start trying to love one another and want better for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13864.433s">And</a> stop this absolute nonsense and pay attention to what the kids are being taught and worry about their future as opposed to the name of the building of where they get their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13873.541s">Sign</a> me more than mad in Medford that it's come to this juncture, Betsy Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13881.024s">OK,</a> so that's the first letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13883.425s">Yep,</a> two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13886.405s">The</a> second letter on this topic comes from Medford United and Eunice Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13896.148s">And</a> she's transmitted to us a packet of information <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13902.341s">So</a> it says, dear May Lungo current school committee members and superintendent Edouard-Vincent, as concerned citizens of Medford, Massachusetts, we submit the documentation to support our position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13913.946s">The</a> name of the Columbus school should remain unchanged. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13916.987s">We</a> strongly believe in the proposed name, believe the proposed name change is unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13922.63s">This</a> packet includes several components, this cover letter, a hard copy of the petition description that was circulated, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13931.684s">online</a> and hard copy petitions that have been signed by current and former Medford residents who oppose the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13938.329s">Total</a> signatures 2,100. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13940.471s">Medford</a> residents signatures 650 plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13945.574s">Differential</a> in signatures, individuals who may not currently resign in Medford, but who have grown up in the city and who continue to have family ties or business interests in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13956.553s">Regarding</a> the handwritten sheets of petitions collected, in some case, the signer signed for him or herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13961.397s">In</a> other cases, written permission was received to sign for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13965.2s">That</a> is why you will see signatures with the same handwriting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13969.664s">One</a> petition site that we use required that we email the URL to the results to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13974.008s">That</a> is the GO petition site, and that was the most recent petition circled and has thus far netted us 21 names, 15 of which are Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13983.8s">Those</a> results will be sent email to the official school committee email. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13988.041s">Information</a> regarding Christopher Columbus is point number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13993.963s">I</a> think that must be in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13996.843s">Number</a> five, information regarding the Italian-American alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14000.664s">We</a> believe that it is a strong sampling of the true sentiments of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14005.105s">We</a> want our voices to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14006.566s">It</a> is disturbing that such a monumental decision that changes the fabric of our city <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14011.297s">was</a> decided with a sheer lack of transparency and community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14015.341s">A</a> decision of this magnitude should have been advertised far and wide across all media platforms and far in advance of a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14022.887s">It</a> should not have been <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14024.398s">advertised</a> only to meet the letter of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14027.381s">This</a> is unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14028.982s">We</a> are deeply disappointed that any steps taken to move forward on this matter are considered ethnically biased, disrespectful, and thoughtless, insulting multiple generations of Italian-Americans who grew up, lived in, attended, and supported and contributed to the Columbus School as well as the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14047.008s">For</a> Italian Americans, this school name has and will always be a source of pride and history. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14052.581s">This</a> is a passionate and personal issue for many on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14056.039s">on</a> both sides and with other urgent matters much higher on the priority list that our city is facing, we are putting forth our best efforts to stop the Medford School Committee from changing the name of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14068.364s">On</a> Friday, March 5th, Educational Commissioner Riley ordered all elementary school students must return to in-person learning effective April 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14076.147s">This</a> should be the school committee's only priority at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14079.809s">To</a> quote a school committee member and their, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14083.345s">And</a> there is a budget, quite possibly the most contentious budget ever, that we will be attempting to craft at the same time as replanning this year and planning next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14093.909s">It</a> would be a gross abdication of responsibility to the children of Medford to spend time right now on the renaming of a school <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14100.834s">when</a> issues directly related to the well-being of our children are smack in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14105.538s">We</a> request that our discussion regarding changing the name of the Columbus School be tabled at this time until our children have returned to school safely for the remainder of the academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14115.846s">Budget</a> issues are managed and there is a plan in place to return our children to the academic year 21-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14122.732s">Thank</a> you for your consideration, sincerely concerned citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14128.356s">And</a> then I have one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14132.758s">on</a> this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14133.559s">This</a> was submitted by Brenna Christensen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14139.104s">Dear</a> Mayor Lungo-Koehn and members of the Medford School Committee, my name is Brenna Christensen and I am a graduate of the class of 2020 from Medford High School and a former captain of the varsity softball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14152.336s">I</a> write to you today to request a name change to Columbus Memorial Park <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14157.793s">the</a> Crystal Campbell Field and to incorporate the name changing of the field to the future name change committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14165.837s">So</a> she's recommending that we change the name of the Columbus School to the Crystal Campbell School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14172.519s">Crystal</a> Campbell was a Medford native, a victim of the Boston Marathon bombings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14177.282s">She</a> was an active member in our Mustang community and was in the band along with the softball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14182.484s">Crystal</a> Campbell was known to light up any room she walked into and she loved sunflowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14187.972s">She</a> is an inspiration to our city, our home, our residents, and our athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14192.853s">Since</a> 2013, the varsity softball team has held the Crystal Campbell Softball Tournament in mid-April at the Columbus Park Softball Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14201.455s">During</a> the two-day tournament, us Mustangs competed against Boricua, Swampscott, and Arlington Catholic High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14207.817s">We</a> actively fundraised during the tournament and throughout our season to donate to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14215.046s">On</a> this day, our community comes together as one and united. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14219.672s">We</a> are truly Medford strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14221.634s">Although</a> this tournament may only be two days out of the year, during our entire season, we wear her name on our jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14228.622s">And</a> we wear it with immense pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14230.525s">It's</a> a day when we give back to the community and honor Crystal's legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14235.089s">Not</a> only is the Columbus Park field home to our high school Mustang softball team, we share this field with our youth softball program and baseball as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14243.675s">We</a> meet our forever friends, learn sportsmanship along with the importance of responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14248.699s">But</a> for all of that, we make memories that will last a lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14251.901s">Each</a> and every play on that field, we keep crystal close to our hearts and play in our honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14256.485s">I</a> respectfully ask that we use our Medford strength, come together as one and rename our fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14261.618s">Let's</a> continue the pride we feel when we wear Campbell on our jerseys and with a positive change to our city, the city we all love and with gratitude get to call home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.304s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.684s">Kind</a> regards, Brenda Christensen, 80 Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14275.307s">So</a> excuse me, she may be asking just for the fields to carry the name and we would do that under a separate consideration, but we might forward her email to the advisory council anyway.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14310.09s">Yes,</a> can I just, there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting from 4 to 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14314.092s">I</a> think originally people thought this meeting, our Committee of the Whole was going to be at 5.30, so just to repeat, it starts at 5.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14322.814s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15015.584s">Yes,</a> so the one thing I just want to say is that the resolution that I'm sending to the Committee of the Whole talks about timeline as does Member Ruseau's. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15033.494s">This</a> is quite separate from and different from discussing the key issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15038.237s">We've</a> already made a decision that the school would be renamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15041.579s">I</a> understand that there are very <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15044.502s">feelings</a> about this and I certainly understand that there are people who are very angry about the process that was used right at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15053.95s">In</a> terms of the timing and us concentrating on what we need to, it was my intent after spending a great deal of time working out the potential for the advisory council to discuss the timeline <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15071.583s">with</a> the committee at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15073.445s">To</a> do so tonight without having reviewed the resolutions just simply won't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15080.49s">It'll</a> be random. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15081.431s">So</a> while I appreciate hearing from my former colleague, the intent was to send the resolution to the subcommittee to discuss timelines and processes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15723.726s">I</a> referenced this earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15726.428s">I</a> very much in good faith went through the process of looking in detail with thanks to my colleague who I used his as a basis to work through all of the issues that I think the advisory council has. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15744.72s">Who's</a> going to be on the advisory council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15746.881s">What</a> are they going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15748.302s">How</a> are they going to report it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15750.183s">Who's</a> going to pick the names, et cetera? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15753.951s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15755.672s">My</a> concern is having done that exercise is while in it, I kept the dates except for one week of that Paul had originally put in his, I don't think it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15772.403s">I</a> just don't think there's enough time to have a good reflective process, a thorough process for the advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15785.959s">I'm</a> not saying that we should overturn our decision about Columbus, which I know many in the community would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15793.463s">For</a> me, the most important thing is to try and figure a path forward, which brings us unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15800.747s">Earlier</a> this evening, we heard those voices of our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15804.669s">And</a> as I was listening to the voices of our kids, I was thinking about this discussion that we were gonna have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15811.877s">which</a> has been feeling such division. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15816.779s">And</a> in our kids, we hear the hope and the desire for unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15823.062s">I</a> think that the advisory council needs time to do its job well and not rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15830.286s">As</a> I've gotten older, I have more and more of appreciation for that word reflection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15836.209s">Okay,</a> getting a chance to think about what we're doing and what name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15843.444s">I</a> have put in mind a chance for a public hearing, not to debate the issue of Columbus, but to look at the new names. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15854.173s">All</a> along, I've been hopeful that we could come up with something that would honor our Italian heritage in this community, but also bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15865.262s">We're</a> not gonna do that fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15866.944s">It's</a> not a slam dunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15869.193s">I</a> know that there's much pain with the thought of even prolonging the process a minute longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15875.456s">I</a> know that I don't really want it to go through this for month after month, but I am very, very concerned that in our short term, we do have a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15887.341s">My</a> feeling is, and again, we can go through, I think going through the process of looking at the process outlined for the advisory council is instructive in terms of saying, whoa, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15899.631s">How</a> are we gonna set this advisory council together? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15901.873s">So</a> that it is really a strong and works to bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15910.56s">Anyway,</a> that's my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15911.841s">I</a> expected to have this discussion on Wednesday.<h2><a href="../2021-03-03_zMDmsK0LIsU/2021-03-03_zMDmsK0LIsU.html">Building & Grounds Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=237.88s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=244.442s">Just</a> so you know, you can ask either member to do that as secretary.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=329.584s">You</a> just might mention the cost.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=778.843s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=780.224s">The</a> mayor has her hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=782.706s">And</a> there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=783.987s">So</a> if you'd let her go first.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=808.083s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=809.244s">So</a> just, Kathy, may I? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.046s">Yes,</a> you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.667s">Yes,</a> go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=813.527s">To</a> be clear then, is the money for this generator, has it already been appropriated or has it not been appropriated?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=838.34s">So</a> right now, while this generator has not been operationable, we're just running off of one generator? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=846.746s">The</a> other generator is what I understand?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=889.887s">John,</a> the other day when I went up to attend the Haitian dance class, which was really fun, it was so hot in the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=901.616s">Does</a> that have something to do with the generator or that's just a completely different issue?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=992.34s">Okay,</a> but the generator, and Kathy, there was actually two bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=996.963s">There</a> were two different bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=998.944s">One</a> was for about 120 something, and the other one was for about 58, if I recall, that you sent out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1005.088s">So</a> is it the combination of those two bills that you're saying we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1011.352s">So</a> 180, roughly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1020.035s">No,</a> it's 128 plus 58, I think, right, Kathy? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1022.976s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1023.376s">And</a> I mean, so we're talking, you know, 130 plus 60.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1027.278s">In</a> a budget which is going to be tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1041.671s">And</a> now am I hearing that this is an emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1046.834s">You</a> know, to get through next year, is that what?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1054.319s">Was</a> this in our former capital plan?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1086.48s">But</a> what you're saying is we need to come up with roughly 200K to get this generator.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1547.572s">I</a> would second that motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1554.295s">On</a> that motion, Paul Rousseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1556.376s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1557.977s">Paulette</a> Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1559.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1560.038s">Kathy</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1561.038s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1795.708s">Not</a> this time around, but last time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1853.115s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1953.515s">HAB-Masyn</a> Moyer-Moyer): So Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1954.677s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1955.258s">While</a> you work on that one of the questions you had up is an important one. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1959.023s">HAB-Masyn</a> Moyer-Moyer): And HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1964.431s">HAB-Masyn</a> Moyer-Moyer): Can can vehicle still drive on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1967.636s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2049.302s">So</a> Kathy Mayer?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2052.403s">So</a> I know that for ADA, it's, I think if I recall, it's one inch per foot or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2059.904s">There's</a> a very prescribed amount that the rise happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2063.885s">It's</a> a very gradual rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2066.743s">Is</a> there enough room to, and if you think about, you know, the actual ramp that's there, you know, it goes back and forth in order to accommodate that very gentle slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2080.529s">Looking</a> at the front of the school at the ramp that we're talking about, which I express great concerns about the safety of on many occasions, <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2090.274s">But</a> is there enough rise to make it into an ADA? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2093.86s">Is</a> there enough room to create the rise, that gentle slope to make it into ADA compliant? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2102.333s">Oh,</a> I would, I would.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2167.101s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2398.994s">Cha-ching,</a> cha-ching.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2757.351s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2758.132s">So,</a> Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2760.835s">Go</a> ahead, Mr. Antiquity just wants to chime in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2763.598s">She</a> said.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2768.494s">So</a> anyway, the concern I have is, you know, as soon as we start just the discussion around the ADA compliance, it does get very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2779.642s">And</a> the question now is, you know, again, that vision committee hasn't gotten off the ground yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2786.347s">You</a> know, how much money <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2788.725s">Are</a> we going to, we all agree that some level of upgrade would be nice just to make it look better right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2796.987s">I've</a> brought a safety concern with the current configuration saying, look, do we put a handrail in? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2806.79s">Can</a> a truck still use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2808.451s">But</a> I understand it's not ADA compliant, that particular ramp, but we've always used the other ramp <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2817.004s">If,</a> you know, right now, I think that there's a question of, I mean, we just have to be mindful of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2822.265s">Now,</a> there was another drawing you shared with us today, just with the Mustang and welcome Mustangs, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2829.826s">I,</a> you know, I'm really, of course, I would love it to be officially ADA compliant throughout every ramp, but I'm just wondering whether we really have the money to go down that route right now and how much money <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2846.208s">do</a> we want to invest? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2849.109s">I</a> mean, I loved Klaus's drawings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2851.529s">I</a> absolutely loved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2852.889s">And</a> that obviously is, you know, just gets you excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2856.87s">But</a> there is a trade-off between how much we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2860.991s">And</a> I'm kind of on the fence about that right now when I think about what financial picture we face in the very short term.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2952.99s">Dave</a> has his hand up, Kathy.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3110.322s">Kathy?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3112.143s">There</a> was another photo that you shared with us, and it had the picture of the horse and blue columns on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3123.132s">It</a> was really a cosmetic upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3129.057s">I</a> had seen that picture when you sent it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3133.6s">that</a> did not look like that was part of a very large or structural. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3140.802s">It</a> wasn't part of a structural upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3142.762s">It</a> was part of a cosmetic upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3145.623s">And</a> I wondered, that was the first time that I remember seeing that particular photo. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3150.084s">I</a> don't know, don't remember that being as part of Klaus's, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3154.505s">So</a> can you-
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3232.627s">Yeah,</a> just so that you know what we're talking about.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.239s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.479s">Vandeku?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3945.72s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3946.22s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that we ask central administration to explore the costs by talking to Mr. Fallon and other people who might have some expertise in this area to how much it would be to pursue the concept of Mr. Dunovan, which we see as it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3970.525s">You</a> know, it's not a whole redo. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3972.066s">I'm</a> getting off here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3973.427s">I</a> should just make that, you know, but how much that would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3977.449s">And</a> also, I'd like to also ask that we explore the idea of the banner in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3983.832s">I</a> don't see them as mutually, you know, one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3987.554s">I</a> think both have great potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3990.316s">I</a> really love marking the door with a little bit more excitement, and I love having a canvas, especially if we have our students input <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3997.7s">into</a> what sort of things we might include on that, how to make it bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4002.602s">And</a> I'd love to know what the costs are associated with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4006.703s">So</a> Peter, if you would, you might give direction to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4010.405s">To</a> make my resolution more compact, that we explore the costs of the front entranceway and possibly a banner for the front side of the building.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4035.935s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=923.46s">Yes,</a> you're done, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=925.381s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=927.562s">So</a> I just have to say that this is really an outstanding review for a new superintendent, or a still newish superintendent, if you would. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=939.106s">That</a> not one of the numbers is lower than a three, and most of them are 3.5 or higher is just truly remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=951.07s">So,</a> you know, the overall picture that we see here is of a very strong performance by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=960.297s">For</a> the sake of the audience, I just want to mention that it's a numbers we were reading was a score. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=966.745s">each</a> of the committee members rated the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=970.888s">One</a> was the lowest rating that she could receive in an area and four was the highest. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=976.751s">And</a> we could differentiate by doing a 3.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=980.834s">But</a> what you're seeing is that in all areas, the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=986.937s">had</a> a very strong showing where not only the majority of the committee, but the whole committee thought that she was doing work of three or higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=998.542s">Remembering</a> 4.0 is the very highest. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1003.123s">And</a> we saw the breakdown of the sheets in some areas, people gave her fours completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1010.766s">You</a> know, we did it a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1014.548s">In</a> the future, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking through each of the areas with my fellow committee members, just so that we're all sure that we're rating the particular item in the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1028.053s">But</a> again, really, congratulations, Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1031.814s">I</a> have to say this is a very, very strong showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1034.895s">And</a> I think that when you opened it up today, we must have seen that that smile must have lit up your office for sure.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1248.186s">You</a> know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1251.947s">We</a> always did them in public or we did a, you know, spoke about our evaluations in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1260.51s">Then</a> they were given to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1264.051s">I</a> would assume that it's just a public, <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1266.813s">you</a> know, paper, which is available to the public, but I don't know how we want to post it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2033.076s">Yeah,</a> we probably should. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2035.958s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2041.521s">Yeah,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2042.822s">It's</a> because it's a committee of the whole, not a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2045.223s">But</a> yes, usually we would move something from the committee of the whole to the regular.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2160.086s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5015.775s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5894.608s">You</a> didn't call my name.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6015.139s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6016.159s">Member</a> Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6018.739s">Through</a> you, through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6022.334s">First,</a> I want to thank the committee for laying this out and Paul for the work you were doing on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6028.496s">I</a> think it's an excellent working document to have at our disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6034.597s">The</a> one thing I wasn't certain if I saw, and I could be terribly wrong, but I didn't see super, I saw goals, but superintendent's evaluation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6117.701s">I</a> saw district goals, but I didn't see any specificity around self-evaluation or, you know, that that would be part of what the school committee can expect on an annual basis.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6181.959s">Well,</a> we receive, if I may, we receive from the superintendent her, and we need to expect to receive the self-evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6194.03s">Yep,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6198.059s">Right,</a> so that's, again, and I'm thinking as if I were a new member looking at this, that if it was put on that, oh yeah, one of the things I'm gonna get is the superintendent's evaluation, and that's gonna start the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6212.106s">So</a> in my mind, I think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6216.748s">Of</a> course, I understand the committee deliberated it a long time, but that was my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6221.61s">Again,</a> the other, I think you did a great job.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6239.412s">Yes,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6241.613s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6567.092s">There</a> are no emails today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6568.894s">I</a> do want to mention that there is a curriculum subcommittee from 4 to 5.30 this Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6575.978s">We're</a> going to be going back to what was on the agenda for a meeting that was canceled, had to do with our world language program <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6587.008s">and</a> also technology.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8154.207s">I</a> guess to that point, is the orchestra playing?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8279.278s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10074.404s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10077.386s">Nunley</a> for her presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10079.747s">And</a> I was curious, Alicia, could you send this to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10085.491s">Because</a> there was a lot in it and a few things I'd really like to go back and take a look at more. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10091.715s">So</a> again, appreciate the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10093.656s">Please</a> send it to us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10629.411s">Yes,</a> well, Mr. Murphy just referenced this, but, and he said it would not necessarily solve the problem, but I can't, in order to address some of my colleagues' concerns, can we post where we have our budget, a page explaining additional funding was coming from the supplemental, and then, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10654.454s">you</a> know, doing the addition or whatever and the final number, just to make it clear and to keep track.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.317s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.778s">If</a> you could do that, I think that that would at least be a start.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10689.095s">So</a> clearly what you're expressing to us is it's a fluid situation so that when you post it, you can post it with that caveat as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11989.486s">Yes,</a> again, I'd like to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11991.688s">Nunley,</a> and I'd like to make a motion to accept their report and put it on file.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12006.127s">We</a> did, well, we received the report.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12013.852s">Yes,</a> and in our conversation, I did ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12016.833s">Nunley</a> to send it to us, which I trust she will, but it is typical that you receive a report and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12025.699s">So,</a> I don't have any reason to... <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12030.437s">not</a> think that this presentation then counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12034.079s">Paul,</a> it's the way that you move on the conversation when we don't have another motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12044.505s">This</a> is the way that we end the discussion and move on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12070.587s">Well,</a> I'll make the motion to say, I mean, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12074.129s">Nunley</a> already said to me that she was going to supply to us, but I make a motion that the director, the city director of finance supply to the school committee, a copy of her report.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12280.908s">Yes</a> so first I want to thank my colleague Melanie McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12286.75s">I</a> know there was a phone call <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12288.606s">a</a> couple of days afterwards and I know I was on it and Melanie was on it and in fact took a, you know, participated and Dr. Edouard-Vincent was on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12301.33s">I</a> think that probably really helped that you both were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12306.491s">And</a> I just, I don't know exactly, is there a dollar amount attached to this or is it more in terms of hours of training or how is it stipulated? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12319.348s">member</a> McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12320.309s">Oh,</a> sorry, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then member McLaughlin.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12379.777s">No,</a> I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12380.861s">I</a> just, thank you.<h2><a href="../2021-02-08_rbPzEysIPRU/2021-02-08_rbPzEysIPRU.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4118.939s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4164.808s">Yes,</a> there's one that, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4167.894s">is</a> separate from the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4170.436s">It's</a> from Cynthia Kinnan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4172.758s">Cynthia</a> lives at 156 George Street, and she has given me permission to paraphrase it and stick to main points. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4183.848s">She</a> writes, I want to express that I see a full return to in-person school or failing that a fully in-person option for all students next year as vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4196.768s">As</a> a parent and an economist, I've been following the research on the consequences of disrupted schooling for both children and parents, and I find them very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4205.235s">While</a> the evidence on the possibility of safe return to school from a public health perspective is quite promising. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4212.201s">Columbus,</a> where my son is in kindergarten and has done a terrific job under extremely tough circumstances, as has the district as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4220.929s">The</a> weekly COVID testing program is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4223.879s">Nonetheless,</a> hybrid rather than fully in-person school has been very challenging for our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4231.043s">Of</a> course, teacher and student safety is paramount for the return to fully in-person school next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4236.907s">I</a> would appreciate guidance from the school district on what I and other parents can do now and going forward to help ensure the conditions are in place for a full return to in-person school in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4248.613s">I</a> hope that by furthering this conversation now, we can make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4252.031s">that</a> there is time to get the necessary funding and resources in place for next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4258.374s">Mayor,</a> there are also many letters pertaining to the Columbus School discussion, which is later on in our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4267.979s">So</a> perhaps we should save them to that point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=5059.147s">What's</a> the date?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6338.905s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6339.966s">I</a> just want to mention how wonderful it was to have the opportunity to join in the middle school assembly this past week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6348.312s">Frankly,</a> you know, as a school committee member, one of the great joys is to be able to see our students in action and when we've been all <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6357.807s">On</a> Zoom, that's been harder to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6359.308s">So</a> bringing us this assembly, getting to see our kids and a lot of them, it was just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6365.232s">So</a> thank you and thanks to all the students and of course to their leadership, Mr. Skorka, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6370.175s">Olson,</a> Mr. Trotta and everybody else who's involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6374.097s">It's</a> something that makes us feel very proud.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=7005.09s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9470.389s">I</a> just wanted to let my fellow committee members know that both the mayor and I, the superintendent, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Cushing, were <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.003s">I</a> think I've got everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.983s">We're</a> in attendance at the request of Pat Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9487.424s">I</a> was invited as vice chair to represent the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9492.186s">And</a> Pat had set up, excuse me, Senator Jalen had set up a Zoom call with DESE, their finance people to talk about the impact of the charter school tuitions on our budget, which is extreme. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9509.831s">The</a> mayor alluded to the <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9511.751s">approximately</a> $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9513.432s">In</a> truth, it becomes even more than that, closer to a million and a quarter when something else is factored in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9520.958s">It's</a> very clear that the people we were talking about were budget people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9525.041s">It's</a> their job to simply implement the formula and not to do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9531.406s">Our</a> entire delegation was there, Senator Jayland, Representatives Donato, Garbley, and Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9540.892s">Paul</a> Donato spoke to the fact that last year, we also sort of fell into this little pit where our funding was lower and they had put together some legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9553.919s">When</a> we spoke, and I was quite adamant about the impact of how starting with a million and a quarter blow, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9564.777s">in</a> our funding would impact us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9567.439s">There's</a> some discussion about what the legislators have to do to try and help us with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9574.323s">Right</a> now, though, the reality of it is, is the way the funding formula works. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9579.006s">We</a> really get sucker punched. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9581.148s">And</a> our delegation is totally aware and totally desirous of being helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9590.874s">It</a> may be advantageous for us to invite them to a committee meeting at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9596.818s">with</a> a follow-up and talk about what other options, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9602.922s">Because</a> right now, I mean, you know, it's a real issue.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9852.758s">I</a> have a question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9856.974s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9857.655s">Is</a> there a role for the school committee in being able to attend any of the sessions or how is that envisioned?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10516.409s">Oh,</a> no, I just wanted to second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10518.33s">I</a> didn't know if anybody had.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10590.312s">Mayor,</a> I feel like that I need to convey to the committee, and I'm sure many committee members know because we've received so many emails to our personal accounts, but there were many submitted to the school committee account as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10606.743s">We</a> had roughly 30 letters <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10611.146s">all</a> of which were similar, saying to us, please don't continue this discussion, don't change the name, and suggesting that this was the wrong time and the timing would distract us from other work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10626.646s">The</a> letters were similar, so I know that committee members have seen them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10630.95s">If</a> I were to read them all, it would take several hours of our time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10636.235s">Conversely,</a> we also received almost an equal number supporting the name change with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10645.184s">The</a> letters were a little bit more different, more, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10648.907s">diverse</a> in their discussions, but again asking that we do keep to our intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10656.81s">There</a> was one submitted I want to mention in particular by a third grade student who also asked us please to keep to our intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10669.514s">So</a> clearly people thought that we might be changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10672.815s">There</a> was also a petition submitted by Medford United <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10677.576s">I</a> think it is appropriate for me to just read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10681.217s">It</a> says please join Medford Mass residents in signing this petition requesting the Medford Mass School Committee and it names us immediately rescind their vote to change the name of the Columbus Elementary School in operation since 1929. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10694.881s">The</a> name change was approved without community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10697.91s">Community</a> input and transparency should be sought before major decisions are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10702.433s">Please</a> sign the petition so we may right this wrong and be the vibrant community we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10707.517s">There</a> were 395 Medford residents on this, but more than, and with 1,426 additional names. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10710.579s">On</a> this, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10719.533s">It</a> is our custom to ask for addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10722.557s">It</a> was just signed with names on the emails I was receiving, you know, I don't think people are necessarily clear all the times that they're supposed to have their address as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10732.77s">So</a> I started writing back to people, but frankly, there were so many kind of got out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10737.609s">All</a> of these will be submitted to be part of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10741.694s">I'll</a> work with Susie on that tomorrow so that we're sure that they're read into the record or they're written into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10750.513s">I</a> think at this point, what I hear your intent is that we're gonna go ahead with the meeting we have, but I do want you to, I wanted to present both the pro and the con and the very deep feelings that people have both ways, very deep feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10771.713s">And</a> if I can interject a personal note, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10775.437s">The</a> question is in this very difficult discussion for in our community because it is and has been divisive is how can we come together in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10786.83s">And</a> that is my deepest hope is that we will find a way to find some common language and common desire around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10797.165s">so</a> that, in fact, it doesn't divide us, but it brings us together in celebration of a rich Italian culture, which maybe isn't defined by the name Columbus.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11107.816s">Yes,</a> I guess one of the things which I'm wondering is if there's a way, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11116.948s">we</a> need some help, I think, bringing our community together on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11122.131s">And,</a> you know, I think it's deeply painful to see such a large rift and people on both sides, you know, obviously very committed, but I don't see yet, you know, I don't see a bridge forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11138.979s">And</a> if anybody, you know, I'm wondering whether there's any sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11146.808s">any</a> steps we can take, and if any community members have some thoughts in this of how we can help bridge this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11157.554s">I</a> know that many people have suggested that we understand the Italian community's concern about losing a landmark that is important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11171.401s">And</a> so many of us, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11175.168s">you</a> know, there's so many different names that could possibly be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11180.551s">If</a> we were to not only, you know, to think about it in a broader sense as an opportunity, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11188.234s">You</a> know, I personally feel it's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11192.897s">I</a> know when I first came to Medford, I found myself delightfully surrounded in a neighborhood where, you know, by a wonderful warm Italian family. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11205.907s">who</a> took us in, who was so valuable to my own adjustment to Medford, and where I learned about gravy rather than sauce. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11214.972s">And</a> I'm just wondering, again, whether there's a, people are very strongly feeling they're negative about taking away Columbus, but I just wanna, is there any potential of going forward and thinking about, is there any place where we might move towards honoring <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11234.95s">our</a> Italian heritage in this community with a different name. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11241.834s">So</a> I just want to throw that out and say, you know, I'm hoping that somebody might start thinking about that in a positive way.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11253.161s">By</a> the way, and the only other thing I did want to mention is we had originally said it was important for our students at the Columbus to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11261.926s">And</a> so I want to make sure we don't forget that piece.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12403.868s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12406.944s">Excuse</a> me, if I could interrupt for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12410.225s">I</a> was just made aware of a mistake which I made, and it's important enough to interrupt and say that the person who wrote it to me is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12422.168s">What</a> I didn't say was that I also, when we were talking about the Columbus School emails, I also had received several emails from members of the Italian <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12433.231s">American</a> community who were not in support of the Columbus name. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12437.394s">And</a> the person who wrote me said that she did not want people to think that all of residents of the Italian community were of one mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12447.882s">So</a> I wanted to make that correction and to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12451.585s">Again,</a> we'll give you the email so that everybody can see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12457.169s">So</a> I'm so sorry and appreciate the correction.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12748.03s">Well,</a> actually on this one, I do disagree because I think that we're going to have so many questions around how different things are going to be handled as we're coming out of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12761.595s">However,</a> I will vote along with it if we can add a caveat that we would be informed about the field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12769.738s">I</a> mean, so that we can follow up with questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12772.799s">For</a> example, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12774.36s">you</a> know, does that cover, we were going to have kids going to Hawaii, well, what if, or Italy or whatever, you know, does that mean that that wouldn't be brought before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12784.488s">It</a> was scheduled in this past, you know, so I'm just, I don't know, a little bit, I do think that there's things that we would particularly want the committee members would particularly be interested, especially since we have a lot of responsibility in this area.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12879.917s">So</a> Paul, would you be okay if we just added a sentence that the school committee will be informed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12886.779s">By</a> email? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12888.159s">Yeah,</a> by email prior to- Absolutely, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12892.04s">A</a> trip taking place? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12894.381s">Yes,</a> that sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12896.201s">Just</a> so we have some opportunity to ask questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12953.424s">So</a> Paul, I would be comfortable with upon approval from the superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12962.173s">I</a> don't, as a school committee member, I don't personally need to do it, but I wanna make sure that there is a check in place because there have been differing circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12974.321s">So</a> if I can add, upon approval by the superintendent, I'm fine with it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12983.247s">That's</a> great.<h2><a href="../2021-02-03_trBcPSLOdhU/2021-02-03_trBcPSLOdhU.html">Special School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2072.074s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2080.221s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2081.242s">It</a> was many hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2082.523s">I</a> remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2088.008s">Sometimes</a> tensions ran high. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2090.288s">But</a> it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2098.013s">And</a> Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2103.877s">So</a> thank you very much and to your team.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1654.862s">What</a> her expectations were.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2314.424s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2319.232s">Melanie,</a> I think you said in your first sentence that a rubric will be created, but the rubric already exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2324.935s">It's</a> just to create a template for us, right?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2689.357s">Notwithstanding</a> all of that and the process, I think that it's only appropriate, though, and Kathy made some comments, and I know we don't want to go into large comments, so I'm just going to say this has been an extraordinarily challenging year, and I think that the superintendent has risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.<h2><a href="../2021-01-25_UWldBjHqpes/2021-01-25_UWldBjHqpes.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4446.617s">So</a> this email, which came in at 3.49 this afternoon, says, hello all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4452.52s">I</a> didn't see it on the posted agenda, but I'm wondering if it is possible to get an update on the status of the formation of a committee to make plans for next steps of the Columbus name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4463.687s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4464.528s">Submitted</a> by Emma Heffron, 18 Curtis Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4468.211s">If</a> you recall, we actually had a letter last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4471.273s">We</a> did say that would be on, I thought it was going to be on today's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4476.638s">So</a> perhaps I'd make a motion that we put it on next, at our next meeting's agenda.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4525.328s">Yes,</a> I also just wanted to announce that there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday from 4 to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4533.211s">We'll</a> be discussing the global language program as well as technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4539.802s">One</a> of our members can't come. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4541.083s">So</a> if anybody else can, I'd love to have another member present. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4545.486s">If</a> you'd let me know you're available, please, I would most appreciate that.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8078.542s">The</a> only thing I wondered is if there was a second student who was particularly interested, and I don't know whether that's the case, but whether we could go back to Tufts and say, hey, we've got another student who's really interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8090.389s">And</a> if that were being, I'm all hypothetical here, but if there was any thought that there was another student who was a close call, I would certainly encourage you to say, could we go back and ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8105.058s">because</a> there is a certain flexibility too with perhaps making a class of another extra student. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8112.223s">I</a> see Dr. Cushing has his hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8142.532s">Well,</a> it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8143.732s">One</a> can only always want more though. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8145.732s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8147.753s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8148.073s">Dr.</a> Cushing?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10790.353s">Member</a> van de Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10792.715s">Yes,</a> I just think it's important to mention, since two of my colleagues mentioned that we're sort of late into the year of setting these goals, <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10802.285s">Is</a> saying that we're so yay late because there's a pandemic and the superintendents was working as many of us noted Earlier around the clock for such a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10812.79s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10813.965s">so</a> hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10814.585s">So</a> I just wanted to thank her for all the work that she's done at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10821.05s">And</a> while I certainly support looking at the goals for another week and revisiting them, I just think it's really, really important to acknowledge all the incredible work the superintendent and her team has done.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11708.93s">Can</a> you restate the motion in our paper?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12369.747s">Yes,</a> so member Rousseau, I'm a little torn here because I can actually see both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12376.991s">However,</a> I don't think that you're correct in saying there's, we're only gonna send it to subcommittee if I'm going to get my way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12384.556s">The</a> whole point of a subcommittee discussion should be an opportunity to get more input, not only from perhaps parents, but also from our educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12395.002s">The</a> high school graduation has been <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12397.263s">mentioned</a> multiple times and you know I used to have a really hard time with it because I was like, Jesus, there's a lot of kids in this audience who, you know, they got the flu or they broke their arm or something happened and they couldn't go to school and now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12411.754s">But,</a> you know, again, maybe they're <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12414.796s">They're</a> finding satisfaction in some other ways, and there may have been kids and I certainly remember, I mean one year there was a year where there was only one kid, but one year there was like five or six and it was amazing that all those kids had really been able to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12432.519s">It</a> is called out at the high school, and it's always by the audience really appreciated and I've always felt kind of funny because I do feel kind of funny about it because I share your concerns about does it does it motivate kids but you know I never knew we gave that award until I went to the high school graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12451.752s">So</a> I don't know how many kids know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12454.494s">My</a> kids never talked about it and said, oh boy, I'm not going to get the perfect attendance award because they never, you know, it just wasn't part of their thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12462.44s">But</a> anyway, so I totally supported going to subcommittee for the purposes of discussion and input. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12468.644s">And</a> I think that, you know, part of it is to be open-minded and listen to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12475.008s">And</a> that's what I would be wanting to do.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3592.866s">Yes,</a> I had put that on because, so over the years it's differed, but there were some years when we've had the student rep has asked to give a report, and it's maybe been a couple of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3605.489s">Every</a> time they do, we've asked them, say, this is terrific, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3610.15s">and</a> we ask them to continue to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3612.512s">Because</a> the students change, unless we're asking for it, I don't think that they'll, the students won't necessarily know. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3619.697s">So</a> I put, I was one of the people who put it on saying that we've done it in the past and when we do, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3627.802s">So</a> we should ask that it be done at least on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3632.505s">I</a> mean, the student reps obviously are always there to be able to contribute, but I think that sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3637.766s">asking</a> for them to give us a report has been very helpful.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3660.526s">Again,</a> Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3664.017s">With</a> food service, it was my understanding that we were supposed to have just the way we have a PAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3669.618s">I</a> think with food service, unless it's changed, we were also supposed to have a inclusive committee for food service that would also give feedback to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3683.881s">I</a> don't believe we met, obviously last year isn't a good comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3691.173s">But</a> certainly for many years, we would meet yearly for food service report, which was also inclusive of issues with food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3701.5s">We</a> might have asked for some feedback about the quality of the food, what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3707.885s">Usually</a> there were students included. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3709.626s">And</a> I think that's kind of dropped off recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3712.328s">And</a> I'm sorry, my other phone is ringing, so I'll mute myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3715.07s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2021-01-11_NISeEVILrmI/2021-01-11_NISeEVILrmI.html">Organizational Meeting & Regular Meeting of the Medford School Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=310.057s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=312.551s">I</a> did speak to Member Ruseau earlier today, and we agreed that if any letters come in today, since I wasn't familiar yet with the process, that he would read them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=322.899s">And</a> I'll take over in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=327.002s">And</a> you'll be the secretary one more night?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=610.752s">I</a> just wanted to – I was in signing the bills last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=615.917s">Finally,</a> a lot of bills came through for food service, which I had been sort of on the lookout for, so I was glad to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=624.266s">Everything</a> else seemed to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=626.188s">I</a> want to thank all of the secretaries, particularly <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=631.374s">Gina</a> Citrano, who sort of helps organize the bills for me, but everybody who is involved in the process of getting the bills together and making sure that we are in order and our bills are being paid as they should be appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=650.35s">There's</a> a lot of paperwork involved and I just am very appreciative.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2626.478s">How</a> many people are in the pool or expected to be in the pool?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5563.988s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mr. Downs and Dr. Burnham. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5567.07s">I'm</a> very interested in hearing about the restorative justice piece that you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5571.773s">Mr.</a> Downs, I did notice in your report you included some great comments, very positive comments, and showcasing real success, especially many comments around the just gratefulness for <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5586.963s">expressed</a> that the kids were able to be attending school in a hybrid way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5592.307s">However,</a> I did notice that you didn't necessarily tell us what the negative comments were. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5598.672s">So</a> if I were to just ask you about what one or two of the most insightful comments on how you could improve, what areas were most suggested?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5615.431s">I</a> am. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5616.732s">And</a> I'm assuming that because you said, here are the positive comments.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5711.913s">And</a> I really do applaud the book club. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5714.379s">I</a> think it's great when you've got your staff coming together to discuss, you know, some new ideas and <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5722.712s">really</a> reflect on thinking, so I think that's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5726.893s">I</a> just want to also ask you though, is there any, I was just kind of been kind of curious, we haven't heard much about transportation issues this year, and I've been wondering how the transportation and the bus, whether many students are using it, what you're seeing, and if you could just address that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7197.788s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7198.688s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7199.509s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7201.227s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to ask, when I look at the schedule, that last piece, the spring sports going to July 3rd, that means that our seniors would have already graduated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7215.054s">Will</a> they continue to be eligible to play? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7217.415s">And</a> how's that going to work?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7256.098s">Do</a> you think that the fact that the season will go beyond the end of school, will our students still continue to participate and not be deterred by that late cutoff date?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2551.429s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2553.225s">So</a> we had the building the future committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2555.526s">And</a> I would say that it came somewhat similar in that there was a great deal of discussion amongst in the community about the shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2567.894s">And</a> then several school committee members, including myself spearheaded, bringing it to the floor for discussion and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2577.28s">moving</a> it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2579.361s">One</a> of the things which helped us was we had dynamic leadership of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2584.223s">Rick</a> Orlando and Tricia McDonough really did such an incredibly fabulous job outlining the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2592.867s">The</a> first discussions were, there was a series of events around the community, listening events, getting people's input. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2602.791s">What</a> were they thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2603.651s">What</a> were they seeing? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2604.551s">What</a> were their reactions? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2607.012s">and</a> their concerns as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2610.055s">And</a> remember, at that point, there was no, you know, in a similar way, we had not preconceived that we were going to build four new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2619.262s">We</a> didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2620.503s">All</a> of that came into being over the course of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2626.387s">of</a> the committee looking at the various different resources, concerns, land parcels availability, but even would they be K to H, would they be, none of that was preconceived. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2641.359s">That</a> was all part of the work of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2645.122s">And</a> that was then defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2648.064s">One</a> of the things that was extremely important was there were different phases of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2653.008s">So</a> the first was kind of the outreach <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2656.271s">Then</a> the second was taking the information and coming up with some decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2661.215s">And</a> those ones then were brought to the school committee for our input, because if we weren't buying it, there was no way we were going to be able to sell it to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2673.908s">And</a> then a variety of different meetings happened around <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2678.812s">uh</a> Medford uh you know outreaching to different groups and whatnot explaining what was um uh <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2686.599s">what</a> project proposals there were, what ideas there were, and narrowing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2691.683s">So</a> it's really quite a process in the same way that I think that we're thinking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2697.568s">Were</a> there discussions about educational? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2701.511s">Yes,</a> absolutely, and they need to be included as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2705.435s">One</a> of the things though that is very interesting sort of looking back is that there will be people who say, I just don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2716.493s">And</a> they really have no understanding today why certain decisions were made back then about either the placement of the schools or why there's a K to eight and a middle school on one piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2732.383s">So</a> that's one of the interesting things as time goes on, those pieces are lost to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2737.787s">And</a> then we have people saying, I don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2741.069s">And</a> I can tell you that all of those decisions were thoroughly vetted <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2746.605s">and</a> that there was a basis for each one of those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2750.566s">But</a> over time, it does get lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2752.806s">And</a> that's a valuable thing for me to realize as we go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2758.567s">I</a> do wanna mention, by the way, that there was at the time, the third stage of building the future committee, which is what we called it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2770.369s">The</a> third stage was the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2773.77s">And</a> there was some work <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2775.49s">you</a> know, things done over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2777.571s">And</a> then at some point, Dr. Perrella, you may recall, the former headmaster of the high school, he put together a, he wanted to put together a grant and he looked very much at the library area and discussed a lot about what should be happening educationally in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2799.897s">And</a> I thought it was a very thorough vetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2801.897s">There</a> was a, at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2804.385s">There</a> was a, they put together a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2807.969s">And</a> that's something that you know as we're talking about the things we're talking about not just the physical structure but how is the building going to be used educationally, we should, even though of course I'm sure it needs to be updated but we should look back to that, what happened at that point to. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2824.638s">The,</a> it was a very dedicated group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2831.043s">They</a> had to be able to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2833.806s">I</a> think at first we were meeting weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2837.869s">We</a> could check with Rick Orlando and Tricia about exactly that, but it was a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2844.454s">I</a> would say that it was probably about a year before we came <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2849.338s">was</a> the first presentation and the first narrowing down steps was, you know, it was a significant process of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2860.487s">I</a> don't know if that answers the question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2894.889s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2895.369s">We</a> certainly had a few staff, but there were also people who acted. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2899.891s">They</a> might have attended the meetings because they were giving information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2903.432s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2905.312s">You</a> know, so it depended, but I think we were we really started at ground zero without great <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2914.69s">you</a> know, with no preconceptions about what was going to happen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3456.258s">One</a> of the things I just wanted to mention was the importance of also having <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3464.44s">members</a> go out and even if just in the initial process we did visitations to other school districts and that was so important and that's really harder to do right now because of COVID but you know most of us are framed you know we know our high school maybe we've been in another one but we certainly you know haven't been in a lot and we we went to quite a few other districts and that was <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3491.793s">very</a> instrumental and that required that people were also available to take some time during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3501.704s">And</a> that was important because it excited us incredibly to see, to come out of our world and also to see what was being offered <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3513.125s">in</a> other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3514.025s">And</a> so I just want to mention that, that maybe it can be conveyed somewhat by people visiting and then doing presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3523.009s">They</a> can be, you know, that might be a job, if you would, that some people go, a smaller amount go and then make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3531.271s">But</a> that's just another aspect we want to make sure we're doing is visitations.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4415.904s">I</a> want to ask member Rousseau to read what he had read at the beginning, his charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4422.649s">Paul,</a> can you just repeat it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4597.186s">Thank</a> you, Paul, you know personally I think that's a fine starting point to be able to I mean, to take what Paul has has written and for us that to deliberate on it to give feedback to the superintendent and, and, you know, for us to <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4617.05s">you</a> know, then if she could develop some way to share that with us, and then I think that would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4625.134s">And</a> while I can understand Jenny's concern about not Maurice having too much, I think it's absolutely critical that Maurice does play a strong role in this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4637.12s">So</a> I think that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4640.401s">You</a> know, I like Paul's starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4642.662s">personally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4643.202s">I</a> think it's a good place to begin with, it's solid, but yet there's also a lot of potentials for discussion as well.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2326.637s">Pfizer,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2328.659s">That</a> was a very comprehensive report with so much information built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2337.648s">you</a> ended up really on the key point that I think we're all concerned about is what will be the impact of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2346.095s">And</a> especially, like I can, if I think about eighth grade, the eighth grade course, we've talked about many, many times how intense that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2356.302s">And</a> so now those kids have gone on into ninth grade, and I'm wondering what the teachers are telling you and what you're seeing so far.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2438.521s">I'm</a> curious whether you're seeing a difference in the students who are fully remote versus the students who are hybrid.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2538.24s">Yeah,</a> I'm having some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2539.601s">I</a> can't unmute myself except by the space bar, and I can't go into a gallery view, so I can't see other people's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2548.887s">So,</a> Jenny, I'm gonna ask you if you can, can you see, if you can see everybody, could you call on people for questions?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2792.189s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3711.607s">I</a> see that the superintendent had her hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4091.18s">Jenny,</a> do you see other hands up? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4092.981s">Or</a> if not, I've got some more questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.166s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.626s">I</a> think you're just making me feel better today, Faiza. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4788.151s">It's</a> okay for me to forget something.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4800.4s">Certainly</a> in the middle of the night, you will pop up and say,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4828.139s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4829.62s">I</a> had a couple of questions, but except is Ingrid, did Ingrid have a follow-up?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4840.147s">Thank</a> you, Ingrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4841.608s">The</a> question I had was for, I was curious whether we had had any parent feedback on illustrative math so far, and also we had <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4855.038s">You</a> talked about the professional development that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4857.72s">Did</a> we have or how many new math teachers did we have into the system at the beginning of this year that needed to have professional development and was that completed?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4927.602s">I</a> wanted to, yesterday by chance I had a discussion with Molly Layden about the document cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4934.188s">And</a> it seems like they're such a popular item right now, they're delayed for another month or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4942.776s">Right</a> now, do some of the teachers have them?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4983.937s">And</a> now I wanted to circle back to my colleague's discussion about creating a catalog. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4991.965s">Faiza,</a> you seem like you're well on your way. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4995.965s">you</a> know, with the information you've presented us tonight, would it be appropriate, Superintendent, to ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5002.247s">Kahn</a> to begin that piece of documenting for the mathematics curriculum, what we are calling a catalog? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5012.49s">But</a> Faiza, I think you heard some of the information that we want, and Jenny, if you could weigh in about other things that you had in mind, particularly for the creation of this document,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5269.396s">I</a> just want to be careful, though, because it's not the it's not the school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5272.837s">We</a> don't want to give you <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5275.498s">direction</a> in whatever I so I had referred through the superintendent whether it would be possible given Wisconsin excellent report tonight if we went on and you know if you might have the discussion with her about taking this to the next step and beginning this process of creating the catalog and you know would seem like as we have these meetings that that's exactly what we should do as sort of after after each meeting is asking the department head <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5305.497s">to</a> in fact create that kind of information that it would be a logical next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5309.622s">So</a> Superintendent if you'd address that please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5558.735s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5559.976s">And</a> Jenny.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5777.054s">Okay,</a> so speaking of squeezing it all in, our next meeting is going to concentrate in January on foreign languages and technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5786.995s">We</a> wanted to get to foreign language because we had raised some questions about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5791.819s">And</a> technology was also in, it's gonna be a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5796.283s">So</a> we might certainly schedule it for a two hour block. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5801.847s">So</a> we have time to devote to each area. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5806.191s">February</a> was supposed to be science. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5809.113s">And</a> then March was, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5811.645s">English</a> language arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5813.867s">I</a> know, Jenny, you had asked whether ELA could come sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5818.552s">The</a> superintendent, I'm not sure if you had the chance to have that discussion with Dr. Chiesa.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5915.438s">So</a> I just want to say at the beginning of the meeting, I was flustered enough with my technology snafus that I didn't announce that the members of the subcommittee are myself and Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5928.661s">Mia</a> couldn't make it, but Paul Rousseau was in attendance tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5933.141s">So</a> we appreciate that he was here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5937.682s">Jenny,</a> do you have any further thoughts before we wrap this meeting up?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5967.66s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5968.321s">Kahn,</a> I would particularly like to thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5971.922s">I've</a> always enjoyed when you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5973.502s">So</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5974.603s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5976.643s">Yes,</a> Paul.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6083.219s">On</a> that motion, Jenny? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6085.862s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6087.184s">Paulette,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6089.487s">And</a> for the sake of it, Paul, you want to vote?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6094.234s">Thank</a> you so much, everyone.<h2><a href="../2020-12-08_vMv1Z56Vk1s/2020-12-08_vMv1Z56Vk1s.html">Regular School Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1368.946s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1369.947s">Yes,</a> so we met on November 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1371.827s">Present</a> was myself, Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1374.448s">Mia</a> could not make it, so Paul Rousseau attended in her place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1379.51s">We</a> began with a presentation from Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lark, co-chairs of the Medford CPAC, and they made a presentation reminding us that they speak for 20% of Medford Public Schools students and <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1394.998s">that</a> they've been advocating for a disability awareness program for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1405.048s">Also,</a> Melanie McLaughlin also attended, and she was the previous head of the CPAC, and also was very active in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1416.258s">advocating</a> for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1418.899s">Joan</a> Bowen and Susanna Campbell presented the disability awareness in the classroom presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1425.842s">Susanna</a> Campbell is presented an overview of the course that she ran last year and is going to now run again this January. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1436.265s">The</a> professional development is <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1438.446s">available</a> on the Professional Development website and is now open for registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1444.588s">It's</a> open to all staff, not just teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1448.109s">The</a> program is going to run Thursday afternoons from 3.15 to 5.15 in January and February via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1454.871s">The</a> course includes the history of disabilities in the U.S., <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1460.973s">and</a> U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1461.433s">legislation,</a> ableism, belief in our society that not being disabled is the norm, disability etiquette, so teachers can model disability etiquette, and asking a person what they want, if they want assistance rather than stepping in, and the unique needs of students with various disabilities, and also tools to break down stereotypes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1490.64s">Key</a> curricular concepts are positive representation of people with disabilities in content area lessons, universal design for learning helps all have better access, anti-ableism language practice into content area lessons, reframe misconceptions, building a more inclusive environment and creating a better community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1517.812s">The</a> next steps, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1520.517s">is</a> to recruit is to have the PD course January and February of 2021 then recruit volunteers to pilot a disability awareness curriculum in February 2021 and then <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1533.541s">a</a> pilot in classrooms, March to May 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1538.222s">This</a> is not a one and done, and this is one of the most important things that really was stressed in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1545.504s">This</a> disability awareness, we want it to be embedded into everyday instruction, so that it's not something that which simply just happens once, it's a, you know, get some fanfare, and then it's left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1557.268s">Rather,</a> the concept <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1558.848s">and</a> the awareness needs to be embedded into the curriculum so it is ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1562.371s">That</a> was a very important point. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1565.493s">We</a> talked about a book that one fifth grade teacher was using and the lesson plans that had come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1575.52s">Last</a> time, 48 teachers took the course and it's hoping that there will be as many this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1584.761s">It's</a> done on a volunteer basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1588.762s">And</a> the end result is creating curriculum units that can be shared amongst our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1601.585s">Again,</a> we talked a little bit about why we weren't doing a specialized curriculum, but rather embedding it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1610.046s">CPAC</a> had done research on this in past years and there had been an attempt at the one school, but it ended up being a special event rather than having the long-term impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1625.659s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1629.742s">We're</a> starting from the pilot and we're growing from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1632.084s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1638.047s">Susanna</a> Campbell mentioned that we're taking a two-pronged course. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1641.711s">One</a> is about teaching students. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1643.413s">The</a> other part is teaching teachers to use universal design to help them become more knowledgeable about disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1655.033s">We've</a> asked that there would be a report and update at the end of the year, and that's been scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1661.957s">And</a> so we'll be reporting back to the committee about how many teachers signed up and took the course and how many volunteers we had and how we were able to implement this this year, this year being 2021 in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1679.568s">Lastly,</a> I just want to mention to you that the <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1684.986s">The</a> next meeting is on December 10th, but that is this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1689.689s">And</a> we're going to be looking at the math curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1692.091s">We</a> also wanted to convey our thanks both to the, particularly to Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorick of the CPAC and to Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen for all the work they did in giving the information for us for this subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1712.625s">That's</a> it.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2284.807s">Always</a> trying to shut me up some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2286.048s">All</a> right, so I just, just for the public, we're not, I'm not going to address this right now only because I think we have some reports coming and we certainly will have some questions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2321.62s">Melanie</a> has her hand up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2340.191s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4670.447s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4671.648s">I</a> just want to be clear on making sure that I understand the teacher's statement and the information that, Tony, you're supplying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4683.059s">Up</a> to this point, my understanding was that there was only one in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4691.627s">Do</a> we have any more than that at this point?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4705.734s">But</a> we've heard that there's a large number of teachers out at the Roberts in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4714.779s">That's</a> because they are quarantining?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4741.753s">So</a> a positive case that was in school, is that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4767.565s">we</a> are not seeing in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4770.927s">If</a> I understand it correctly, what you're saying is that because of the testing and our ability to pick up cases, we are getting to those students and faculty members before they've actually become positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4789.1s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.367s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.968s">I</a> mean, I certainly understand the, you know, when all of a sudden we hear that there's a greater number of teachers who are on quarantine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4817.015s">I</a> certainly understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4818.256s">And</a> I think all of us feel this right now, this anxiety as we see the case number get higher and higher throughout not only Massachusetts, but the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4830.746s">And,</a> you know, sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4833.268s">it's</a> very unsettling. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4835.149s">But</a> what you're saying is so far the data says that we're doing okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4866.136s">Now,</a> by no means am I dismissing the anxiety attached to being told you should quarantine or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4874.945s">I</a> mean, I certainly understand that that is an important piece of what our staff and teachers are conveying to us is that they're nervous about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4888.306s">But</a> what you're saying right now is there's really been no change in the data, which would suggest that we need to do something different in terms of having students come to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4899.696s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4959.027s">I</a> guess then the next question really goes to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4963.931s">When</a> we see the number of staff getting higher because they're on quarantine, do we have enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4972.118s">And</a> I know that there's been an incredible effort <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4976.135s">to</a> cover classes and that the administrative people and others have just really stepped up and covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4984.402s">But</a> when we see what's going on at the Roberts right now with a certain level of teachers being out, are we able to cover the classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4992.93s">Is</a> it still working?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.349s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.649s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8206.45s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8208.431s">Adam</a> is seeking to, has his hand up for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8211.837s">Yes,</a> I was going to that next. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8214.459s">Adam.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9816.645s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9819.546s">I</a> think this is a very positive thing for our students, and I particularly like to see the teachers who responded about how this, even though students may not be in school, it's still pulling them together and creating a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9833.392s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.432s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.812s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11582.027s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11584.792s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11588.495s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11589.836s">First</a> of all, I want to express my gratitude for the extensive amount of work in putting this together and updating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11598.223s">I</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11599.264s">They're</a> very comprehensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11603.328s">Specifically,</a> on page 28 on the form itself, bullying incident reporting form, I see that it says date of report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11613.628s">but</a> I don't see a line that says date of incident or even date of alleged incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11620.113s">And</a> so a report could be made six days afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11626.337s">I</a> think we should clarify what the date is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11631.12s">Now,</a> perhaps it does exist someplace, or maybe you just assume that somebody would write it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11636.564s">But</a> just in case, to me, that just stood out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11641.714s">Peter,</a> do you want to talk to that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11653.223s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11655.485s">The</a> next thing I want to speak to is that when I see the page and I'm flipping back about notifications, there's not a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11663.091s">And</a> I'm concerned that there aren't timelines put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11666.814s">Notify</a> parents, caregiver of the target. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11671.033s">When</a> does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11672.734s">I</a> mean, you know, all of a sudden, you know, when the investigative report, I sort of, I think that we, that we need to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11683.039s">And</a> I understand timelines are tricky because there's holidays, there's weekends, there's whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11688.142s">But</a> yet without any timeline, you kind of take away some level of teeth to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11695.343s">Now,</a> my colleague Melanie brought up many good reports and I really do like the idea of a simple one page thing, a summary, in some ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11706.602s">But</a> the other thing which makes me a little bit nervous is that because this is so comprehensive, I'm not really comfortable just approving it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11714.826s">And</a> normally I would expect that this would go, and I know nobody wants to have another meeting, but normally I would expect it to go to rules and regulations or whatever policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11727.892s">So</a> rather than just approving it, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11730.207s">If</a> we're not gonna send it there, and I don't know the will of the committee, I would suggest we lay it on the table and we have updates, the one page update added to it before our approval at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11744.355s">But</a> I would like to, I'm not gonna make the motion, I'd like my colleagues to weigh in and let me know what their comfort level is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11796.51s">Yeah,</a> that's kind of an unusual way for a school committee to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11802.051s">I</a> mean, because part of me would say that you'd certainly be following this better policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11812.333s">But</a> I guess I'm comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11817.224s">What</a> about the timelines issue?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.226s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.646s">And</a> to add the date of the incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11854.467s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11869.946s">Well,</a> I would like to see it where it says date of report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.27s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.63s">I</a> have to find the page again. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11878.212s">It</a> might be 28.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11880.634s">I'm</a> looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11883.356s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11885.777s">Where</a> it says date of report, right underneath that, if you move that up rather than making it, it should say date of incident or date. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11896.365s">It</a> could be dates, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11899.703s">Anyway,</a> I see some of my colleagues have their hands up, so I'd like them to weigh in.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12311.141s">Jenny</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.121s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.862s">Kathy</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.003s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.683s">Melanie</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12316.391s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12317.091s">Mia</a> Mastone? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.052s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.812s">Paul</a> Rousseau?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12320.633s">Paulette</a> Vanderkloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.454s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.914s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12971.69s">I</a> believe that the first piece of that is that the superintendent would supply the school committee with a self evaluation and I <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12983.54s">certainly</a> support that it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, but I think that it's a little bit unfair to ask her to have that ready by December 21st in just two weeks, given all that she's handling right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13001.592s">So</a> I would respectfully ask that we put it to the first meeting that she would supply us that documentation at the first meeting of January.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13166.533s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13167.593s">I</a> think it certainly, Kathy, since you had that review, if you could just send it to the rest of us so we could see the other steps involved, I think that would be important for us to review.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13395.845s">Yes,</a> but keep in mind that we have, in fact, been setting goals for the superintendent throughout this period. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13402.549s">We've</a> talked about goals of inclusivity, of involving, if you think about all the meetings that we had during the summer, we've set a goal about getting kids back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13412.956s">It's</a> not like, I realize it hasn't been in the formal <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13418.659s">way</a> that you're suggesting, but it would be erroneous to think that we haven't been giving direction to our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13429.724s">And</a> we certainly have plenty to be able to reflect upon on how she has been handling this process, which is, in my opinion, been extremely strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13443.35s">My</a> recollection from all other times is what we do is that each of us individually will fill out an evaluation once the superintendent gives us her self evaluation and then we'll gather as a committee and discuss it and <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13461.784s">decide</a> how we're gonna come up with either a collaborative document to then share with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13470.066s">And</a> I think in the past, the superintendent has been part of those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13474.427s">But</a> again, I think that the next step is to review what we're supposed to do technically, just to, so we all are on the same page, and that we ask the superintendent to provide us with her self-evaluation <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13489.42s">by</a> mid-January at the latest, so that we can go ahead with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13494.423s">And</a> I think we're all in agreement, really.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13524.924s">Yes,</a> I think we've already articulated many goals which we could write down and then we could take a look at and articulate goals for the rest of the year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13562.148s">Well,</a> and the superintendent also has a major piece in setting out goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13568.652s">So</a> it's a joint conversation because she's very much will be a piece of articulating those goals and quantifying them as you suggest.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13837.021s">Let's</a> set it for February 8th, that it will be done by February 8th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13867.758s">By</a> the 8th, the process should be complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13870.34s">So</a> that means that if the superintendent gives us her self-evaluation at the first <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13876.108s">or</a> even the second meeting in January, and the first might be preferable, or mid-Feb, whatever, that we will have set up a committee of the whole meeting, and we will commit to having done the self-evaluations and the other steps.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13924.396s">I'm</a> saying that because I think Jenny does have a point that we want to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13928.079s">So</a> that's why I'm putting an end date. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13930.501s">If</a> we get it done before that, that's even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13933.183s">But</a> this way, we've given the superintendent enough time, but we've committed ourselves to making sure it gets done.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13954.812s">Graham?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13955.692s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13956.393s">Kritz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13957.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13958.034s">McLaughlin?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13959.475s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13960.195s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13960.355s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13960.936s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13961.756s">Russo?</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14104.191s">Mayor,</a> I would ask that we allow the superintendent a little bit more time than the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14109.154s">And</a> to Member Graham, this is part of the superintendent's job to set up these meetings and do it in a timely fashion and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14120.76s">And</a> I sometimes feel like it's important to let her have the latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14126.503s">I</a> understand your <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14127.74s">your</a> need to make sure that it's started early and that process is started early. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14132.722s">But</a> again, I just personally, I think that we need to trust the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14142.507s">And</a> if she's not setting up the budget in a timely fashion or whatever, and I just don't think we have to legislate it as my own personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14153.151s">I</a> think that if you're, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14154.905s">Concerned</a> about it or any member is concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14158.647s">I</a> think that for me that the best way about it is having conversation with the superintendent and only if she's not then being responsive would you then go about and put it in a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14169.593s">So</a> my personal opinion is that this falls under the superintendent's purview and you're suggesting I think that you would like to have it sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14182.194s">If</a> you want to go forward with your resolution, which I'm sure you do, I would just suggest that we say that by the end of January, just to give her a little more latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14191.726s">So</a> I would amend it to be the end of January.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14256.296s">Will</a> you accept the amendment to the end of January, Jenny?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14384.493s">So</a> I think I've offered an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14386.875s">I</a> think Kathy has seconded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14388.677s">So</a> should we vote on the amendment?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14403.391s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14404.112s">On</a> that motion.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14653.56s">Thanks,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14655.781s">So,</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14658.803s">Just</a> a follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14660.063s">So</a> that means, will the superintendent then report back to us at our next school committee meeting about when that report can be done?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14932.201s">Should</a> we vote on it as a motion?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=37.733s">Member</a> Paul at Vanderkloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=38.953s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=39.554s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2325.132s">Yes,</a> so I just wanted to go back to Mary Ann if I could, or Tony, I don't know who better to ask this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2332.22s">So</a> all together there we have 27 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2335.523s">When</a> the contact tracers call their home, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2338.967s">Is</a> it generally, like of the 27, do they know where they were in contact with someone with COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2348.65s">Do</a> they have certainty of the, like you mentioned, well, the father had it or the mother, or do you have people saying, I have no idea?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2395.52s">Do</a> you follow up and ask them if they've been going to the grocery store and other specifics?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2411.164s">So</a> of the students, of the 27 students, if we could talk about in-school transmission, how many of those are suspected to be in-school transmission?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2439.338s">So</a> in the in-school transmission case, and I realize we don't obviously wanna identify anybody, but how was it determined that that student, did they come to school sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2456.088s">Could</a> you just give us a better understanding?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2482.005s">Okay,</a> thank you, Maria.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3082.227s">I'll</a> second.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4982.175s">Well,</a> I know they've been waiting an awful long time, but what I would do is I could just ask Member Graham one question for clarification, and then if you would call upon me after we let the residents speak, I don't want them to have to wait any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4995.72s">But</a> the clarification is, Jenny, you mentioned maybe I should make an amendment, maybe it should be a new resolution, but I wasn't sure what, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5005.104s">precisely</a> you are either amending or what your resolution would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5009.525s">So</a> could you give us the wording so we understand?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5123.327s">So</a> to clarify, if there was the Brooks School classroom, second grade was sent home, it would say, you know, so sort of a red flag, current closures, Brooks School, grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5139.989s">So</a> if we- Select grade two or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5142.71s">Right,</a> so that's just a total hypothetical to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5146.152s">But</a> then the question is when we do that, and this goes back to Marianne, is the whole confidentiality issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5157.157s">And</a> are we really giving people more, I mean, if grade two is closed at whatever school, okay, wouldn't automatically, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5170.197s">parents</a> would be notified, let's face it, the school would soon know, what are you really accomplishing? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5176.618s">I</a> mean, yes, it is a way of, it would be one way of seeing it across the district, and from that, I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5183.02s">You</a> know, Brooks grade two, Roberts grade four, you know, Cohart C, you know, that would work.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5241.391s">So</a> if the box said, or if the next current closures, okay, so the box said current closures, and right now, do we have any closures, superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5258.038s">Let</a> me ask the confidentiality question first.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5526.101s">So,</a> Mayor, I actually had the floor, but I wanna get to, I know Mr. Began has had his hand up for a long time and there are others, but, and then I'd like to make a statement afterwards.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5548.587s">I</a> don't think he heard you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5550.95s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6125.909s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6126.989s">So,</a> some of the speakers made points that I wanted to make and first I will start out with Mr. begins point that the really great news is just the one in school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6139.195s">And</a> that's, that's just fantastic news and. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6143.517s">we</a> can certainly hope that we can continue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6149.903s">To</a> the speaker who talked about the role of the school committee and us representing, well, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6157.049s">And</a> when I was elected, I always take that a certain amount of people at least have enough faith in my judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6166.497s">Sometimes</a> we will disagree, but overall, you have listened to me enough and you have some level of faith in my thinking and in my judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6177.2s">As</a> a school committee member, I have watched our superintendent and her team very carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6185.662s">We</a> looked at the policies that we've outlined and I see them following them and working very meticulously as many of the speakers made reference to. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6197.169s">I</a> have personally no reason to question her judgment on making a call if we were <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6207.568s">facing</a> a situation, I believe that she would evaluate with her team and with the city people, and also maybe a call to the school committee members, because we certainly would want to be kept in the loop, but I've never felt that I've not been kept in the loop by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6225.252s">But</a> I wouldn't need to be called into a special meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6228.073s">I</a> wouldn't want to put that as this body, the school committee, now would be the ones who make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6237.815s">I</a> have trust that the school committee has selected our superintendent to carry out our policies and I have every reason to believe that that's what she would be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6251.199s">So</a> I would support the motion by my colleague and also like to thank everybody for all their <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6260.021s">work</a> on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6262.302s">I</a> would support the clarification that member Graham spoke to. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6270.926s">In</a> the general sense, not specific, because I think we went through the discussion about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6275.929s">And</a> so I think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6278.75s">If</a> you wanted to do an analogy, we could talk about snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6283.915s">And</a> some might say, well, Paulette, you're making it so simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6287.539s">But</a> frankly, when there's a snow day, a superintendent makes a call with a lot of different inputs about the safety <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6298.825s">of</a> the travel for our students, travel for our teachers, the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6306.388s">She</a> confers with other experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6308.889s">She</a> might confer with other superintendents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6311.891s">And</a> there's always going to be people who are going to disagree with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6316.072s">And</a> there's always going to be people, and luckily we've heard from some of them tonight, which is nice that you've taken the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6323.195s">who's</a> going to support the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6325.116s">Yes,</a> it's a simplification, obviously this is far more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6329.137s">To</a> the speaker who said you're not giving parents enough, well the problem is that this is a pandemic and all I can say to parents is <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6338.4s">At</a> any point, we need you to think about your backup plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6342.443s">I</a> am sure many of you, all of you, are thinking about that on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6347.846s">We</a> are in a circumstance that calls upon families to be flexible and nimble in the most difficult ways, which obviously none of us would possibly choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6362.595s">So</a> on saying all of that, I would support leaving the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6367.076s">I</a> always feel that as a school committee member, ultimately, as I vote on the superintendent's contract, that is my probably most important role in so many ways besides making policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6380.659s">And</a> this superintendent, Dr. Marisa Edward-Vincent and her team have showed extraordinarily dedication and also have worked <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6391.582s">very</a> closely with the school committee to make sure that they are doing what we are asking of them.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6890.314s">I'd</a> like to move the question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7926.064s">Do</a> you want to do the amendment first?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7938.114s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7940.255s">On</a> the amendment, can we just lump them together? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7943.677s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7944.377s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7946.038s">On</a> the amendments, member Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7949.559s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7950.22s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7951.52s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7952.321s">McLaughlin?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7953.441s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7954.502s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7954.642s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7955.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7956.303s">Rousseau?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7960.545s">Hall?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7964.197s">Vanderclute,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7965.758s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7988.725s">Yeah,</a> Kathy, what was the original motion?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8080.314s">Continued</a> authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8081.615s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8190.462s">It's</a> still giving authority to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8198.829s">But</a> authority for what I think is what I'm trying to be clear about. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8202.57s">to</a> determine whether the schools need to close or should remain open.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8221.183s">Jenny</a> Graham?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8262.741s">We're</a> affirming the superintendent's authority too.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8313.501s">I</a> don't think that separating section two with section three makes any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8319.045s">I</a> think that it's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8325.411s">So</a> I don't understand my colleagues' <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8330.463s">Um,</a> lack of clarity on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8331.884s">I</a> mean, to me, um, we're saying, yes, the superintendent is the one who's going to make the final call. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8338.269s">We're,</a> we're saying the superintendent, the school committee is not going to be called into session to make, to make, to take the vote.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8410.965s">That's</a> just an unreal place. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8412.666s">I</a> mean, we have meetings every two weeks.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=44.301s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=44.701s">I'm</a> just taking a look whether Tanya is here yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=49.144s">She</a> is.

by our SPEDPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=271.83s">By</a> the way, today, <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=274.705s">The</a> meeting can be viewed on Comcast 15 and Verizon

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=329.093s">Great,</a> hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=330.294s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=332.075s">So</a> today we're gonna start off with a presentation that I don't know who's the lead person, but Tanya and Alex are going to start off with a presentation at the beginning of our meeting here so we can review the work that they've been doing over the years as part of the PAC.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=362.968s">Sorry,</a> I didn't hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=364.068s">There</a> we go.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=413.641s">Mine</a> is cut off as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=415.921s">Maybe</a> I can.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=762.902s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=763.222s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=764.583s">Thank</a> you so much, Alex. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=765.885s">And</a> thank you for all your work with the special education pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=770.609s">As</a> you know, this is something that I've believed in very firmly and have been part of the discussions in the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=778.775s">So</a> this is the year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=781.298s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.018s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.419s">Having</a> said that now, I think I'm going to turn it over to Joan and or Susanna. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=787.363s">I</a> don't know who's going to take the lead.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1342.43s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1549.245s">So,</a> Suzanne, can you tell me how many teachers took the course the first time and what your hope is for enrollment.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1608.762s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1611.064s">So</a> I think that this work that you've been doing is really excellent, you know, and I've loved seeing the lesson plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1620.79s">My</a> only concern is it's possible that a student would go through eight grades and not happen to get any consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1634.687s">discussion</a> from year to year, depending on who this child's teachers are.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1877.757s">I</a> might, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1881.282s">Susan,</a> do you want to answer and then go to Alex?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2151.015s">So</a> I had a question, um, the book that you cited, uh, from the teacher's lesson plan, out of my mind, is that a book that fifth graders, um, in most classes are reading?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2240.551s">Right,</a> what I'm thinking is that, you know, again, it's wonderful the work you're doing today and the work you'll do in the next go round, but is there a way to, you know, suggest to other teachers who aren't participating at least to be looking at that lesson plan, which seems to be very comprehensive, so that maybe they'll be choosing that book too. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2267.943s">to</a> read in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2269.384s">Again,</a> my concern is what you're doing is fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2274.768s">It</a> just is for those who either aren't participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2277.99s">And</a> I totally understand that this year is so, again, how do we get all the curriculum pieces in? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2284.235s">And</a> that's why it's so fantastic to be able to infuse it into the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2289.118s">But</a> I'm wondering how we can encourage all teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2294.325s">to</a> be looking at those. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2296.787s">I'm</a> wondering if we can identify a couple of lesson plans for each grade and send them out and just say, hey, FYI, this is one of the things that the district is really looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2307.874s">Here's</a> some great lesson plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2310.195s">I</a> would think that for some of our teachers, they might be vastly relieved to have it laid out so clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2317.72s">So</a> I guess I'm trying to say, how do we ramp it up a little bit more? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2325.136s">You</a> know, and I'm looking into next year too, how are we making sure that we are hitting, that there's, I mean, there's multiple topics, not just one topic, but so many different topics effectively for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2340.469s">And,</a> you know, I bet there will be some teachers who would just absolutely shine at doing this, but if your kid is not in that class, that's what the problem is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2387.485s">Jenny?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2703.061s">And</a> remember, we also just last month talked about the racial equity piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2710.007s">So</a> it's not just this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2712.71s">So</a> there's multiple things that we're trying to provide comprehensive education for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2723.499s">So</a> we have to talk a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2726.301s">Maurice,</a> I see superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2901.923s">I</a> was wondering whether any of the teachers who've participated before have been from the vocational school.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2938.874s">Well,</a> where I'm what I'm thinking is that, you know, as teachers are attending this they're also learning more about the disabilities that they students might have, particularly say, you know, a student on the spectrum. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2958.308s">that</a> that goes across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2960.19s">So</a> it may not be that the carpentry teacher in essence is really teaching or developing a unit, but also I guess there's another piece of saying, how do we make sure that our staff is knowledgeable about different disabilities that their students have? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2982.563s">And</a> I don't know how we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2984.164s">Does</a> anybody wanna address that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3069.064s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3071.459s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3072.42s">Anybody</a> else like to have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3075.483s">Comment?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3077.125s">Joan?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3078.206s">No?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3125.575s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3127.737s">Does</a> anybody else have any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3130.439s">Yeah,</a> Alex?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3169.702s">Well,</a> Alexia, that was exactly my question, is saying how will we follow up on this and then make sure that we're expanding on it in successive years and being able to also evaluate our success of <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3189.233s">implementing</a> this curriculum or in our larger school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3196.216s">Any</a> thoughts on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3274.788s">How</a> many teachers are you thinking in terms of the pilot?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3302.937s">Okay,</a> I would think that it makes sense for this topic, again, that we touch back on it, either at the end of the year or definitely at the very beginning of next year, so we can see what happened and where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3320.0s">Does</a> that seem, the pilot program was listed in the original presentation, was that from March to May?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3331.506s">Okay,</a> that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3333.126s">So</a> we can either add it on, perhaps, to our topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3336.247s">We</a> do know how crazy June gets, but I think that we need to circle back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3342.009s">Alex?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3425.119s">As</a> you say that, it also jogs me to be thinking that there are budget implications because we want to make sure that if there are particular books or units that people are excited about presenting, that they have the books or materials that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3445.395s">So</a> doing this prior to budget so that we were knowledgeable about what we would need would be particularly good.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3455.785s">Yes,</a> Paul.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3508.574s">Yes,</a> Melanie.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3591.777s">Okay,</a> so Jenny, would you like to make a motion that the school committee curriculum subcommittee receive a reconvene in June or prior to budget so that we can get an update and we can see what funding might be necessary to continue this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3616.995s">Yeah,</a> sure.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3761.691s">That</a> means that we have actually accomplished something we have yet to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3766.146s">We</a> are having a shorter meeting than called for. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3768.874s">And</a> that's because everybody was so well prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3772.104s">Thank</a> you so very much.<h2><a href="../2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE/2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE.html">Regular School Committee Meeting November 16, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1411.531s">Yes,</a> so the ramp, as I understand it, was put in to assist loading and unloading, particularly of the musical instruments and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1421.996s">And</a> it was never meant to be ADA accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1425.477s">If</a> you recall, there is an ADA accessible ramp at the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1430.86s">My</a> safety concerns, though, is that because it is there, that it opens us up to concern automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1440.646s">As</a> you think about it, there is no railing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1443.376s">When</a> I come out of the building at night from a concert, I have been concerned on many an occasion that someone could make a misstep in the lowered light, even though we've improved lighting there, but it'd be highly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1458.92s">And</a> that's for anybody, not only somebody who might also use the ramp, which might have some concerns, maybe wheelchair, whatever, it's clearly too steep for, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.043s">safe</a> wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.943s">So,</a> but that is not the designated ADA ramp, but it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1481.065s">And</a> again, it was put in for, you know, all of a sudden it appeared and there was a reason for its appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1487.586s">But</a> for me personally, from the time it's gone in, I've been concerned about it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1499.343s">You're</a> at the front of the building, and you're looking at the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1502.543s">And</a> the ramp is, part of it is stairs, but the ramp is right there on the left.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1512.265s">No,</a> no, it's outside.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1516.426s">Outside.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1517.446s">So</a> you've probably been up and down it 1,000 times, Melanie.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1540.27s">For</a> me, it's not so much an accessibility issue as my concern about what if someone makes a misstep off the side.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7476.342s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7479.016s">So,</a> you know, I just, I'm not privy to the details of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7484.059s">None</a> of us are, except perhaps the two of you, and somehow or another, it doesn't seem like it's really moving us ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7493.145s">It</a> sounds like there's some will to have further discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7497.308s">I</a> have a hard time because I know I'm not an expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7501.535s">I</a> know I'm a school committee member who has great intentions and wanna do the best for our kids, but I'm not an expert on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7508.637s">And</a> so that means that I have to listen to experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7511.578s">And</a> in some places I'm a little worried because I feel like some perhaps of my fellow school committee members think that they can interpret things in a better way than some of the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7523.442s">And</a> I'm not, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7525.683s">I'm</a> feeling a little uncomfortable about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7528.125s">I</a> think that we do need to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7529.646s">If</a> we're going to have a meeting on it, where the potential would be maybe next Monday, if I threw out a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7538.773s">I</a> don't know what the will of the entire committee is at this point about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7543.177s">I'm</a> definitely feeling uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7546.359s">I</a> understand arguments that I'm hearing, but <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7551.102s">You</a> know, what are the major question is, I've heard some things about metrics and looking into how Tufts changes us, our potential numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7562.767s">Clearly,</a> Mr. Rousseau is saying that the current policy that we have is not accurate and needs to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7570.909s">But</a> at the same time, I heard the superintendent say something about that it was being updated

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9195.213s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9200.865s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9202.465s">It's</a> really great to see the innovative ideas of our teachers and our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9208.228s">Clearly,</a> some of the photos we saw enjoying themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9212.43s">And</a> I'm sure that behind each one of these, there's many more stories that could be told. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9216.972s">But</a> it's nice, especially when we have this kind of meeting, which has had its difficult points to then have this bright side. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9226.376s">So</a> thank you very much for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9229.222s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10727.582s">Yes,</a> I wanted to go back to the elementary portion and ask specifically two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10734.047s">First,</a> we talked a great deal about the Columbus second grade and bringing in a second teacher because of the unique circumstances that had happened, but I don't see that reflected in a split or have we brought in a second teacher?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10759.996s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10760.296s">Are</a> they working in unison or have each taken a portion of the students?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10790.399s">Right,</a> especially as the students had begun, that actually makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10796.904s">Has</a> the feedback from parents and students been positive? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10802.129s">So</a> far, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10803.01s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10805.459s">The</a> second question I had, and I just wanted to refer to it, is at the time when we discussed it two weeks ago, I had brought up the issue that you referenced that needing to change <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10816.918s">some</a> of the specialists, and I was quite concerned about that because I know for my own grandchild how important those specialists are to him, and were they changed, it would cause him great stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10831.969s">So</a> I was very concerned when I had received some emails about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10836.672s">One</a> in particular stood out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10839.454s">I</a> haven't received any out, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10843.076s">input</a> after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10844.497s">I'm</a> hoping that means that the new specialists have quickly, the kids have quickly adjusted, but that was something that was unexpected and I'm not totally sure whether it was, I know it hadn't been communicated to us, so I didn't understand it was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10861.429s">Are</a> we stable at this point with the specialists and are you getting any other feedback about that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10921.877s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10922.417s">I</a> know, you know, in my own, obviously, I don't think it's the ideal situation by any, you know, stretch, but I think that what I'm hearing is really it's what you had to do in very unfortunate circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10937.265s">So,</a> you know, I keep on putting that, trying to put that into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10940.286s">And,</a> you know, today we had to, we were asked to submit videos for, to the McGlynn for their Medford Pride Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10948.788s">And</a> one of the things, words I had to use was flexible and proud of our students for being flexible, because I think that's such a key here and something that we have to keep on patting them on the back for, and also to our teachers and staff too about, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10966.232s">striving</a> to keep that flexibility as we work through these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10974.138s">Anyway,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11011.95s">Oh,</a> that's good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.01s">I</a> did not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.87s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11014.43s">Great</a> to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11015.211s">Thank</a> you, Suzanne.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2020.361s">So</a> right now we haven't had that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2023.042s">No,</a> no, we haven't.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2183.419s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2184.639s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2185.479s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2186.4s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2206.014s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3465.521s">I</a> have a question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3468.362s">Yeah,</a> I was just curious whether we've been able to go yet to the next level and find out, say, with the 38 students, is that 22 families? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3479.704s">Are</a> there multiple siblings? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3482.345s">Have</a> we been able to look at the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3487.706s">I</a> would think that would be the next step and say if it hasn't been done yet.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3587.912s">I</a> think it's very valuable information for us to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3591.655s">As</a> I know, it must have been very time consuming to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3594.698s">But</a> it really gives us a good picture about where we're standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3598.701s">And</a> it also reassures us as committee members of knowing that all of this outreach and touch has happened in a very clear way that we can see on these tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3609.431s">It</a> really sums it up nicely for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3612.593s">So</a> I appreciate it very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6469.153s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to first, Tonya and Alex, I want to thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6473.074s">I</a> thought it was very, very interesting to read through all the responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6476.615s">And,</a> you know, they kind of fell to me in two different categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6481.256s">One</a> was the level that was heartbreaking when people just said, I'm struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6486.178s">I'm</a> having a really tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6487.698s">And,</a> you know, at one point, I just felt like <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6490.399s">tears</a> coming to my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6491.38s">I</a> was sort of thinking of parents really in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6495.301s">But</a> I also had a second feeling and that was there were many responses which really spoke to the dedication of our teachers and the positive interactions that had happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6506.207s">And</a> locally there's a child not far from where I live who <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6513.715s">is</a> in an out placement and I've spoken to his father and he has said so many wonderful things about the people who he interacts with for his special ed child. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6527.698s">And</a> I really think that was brought home in the survey as well and want to thank our teachers for their dedication.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7606.733s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7607.894s">Yes,</a> Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7609.576s">Yes,</a> I had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7611.578s">First,</a> could you please remind us, Peter, was this translated into a variety of languages? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7617.163s">And</a> did we get any ones that were translated back?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7651.624s">Okay,</a> my second question, or really just a comment, Peter, is on the slide where you ask about how much time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7659.411s">That's</a> a little misleading because you're, in terms of helpfulness, because it's K to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7668.238s">And</a> what my expectation might be for a high school student is very different than a kindergarten student. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7674.503s">So</a> were we to do it again, if we could break it down at least into elementary, middle, and high school, for me, that would make more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7684.43s">But</a> otherwise, I certainly appreciated the information and that you did this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7719.444s">The</a> other thing which would be interesting, especially in the upper grades and perhaps middle school too, is at some point to ask kids how they're feeling and to return, you know, to see what kind of feedback we get from students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7734.73s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8397.208s">I</a> had received several letters as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8400.83s">I</a> think we all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8402.131s">And</a> I think we all feel the same way, the same as Peter and Paul have just conveyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8409.015s">It's</a> important that we will celebrate this class. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8411.436s">It'll</a> be the most unique and different sort, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8416.339s">There's</a> things we don't know now, but certainly it's not if, it's really a question of when. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8423.023s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8423.543s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8923.644s">Yes,</a> this is slightly off topic, but I haven't heard any updates about the advanced placement exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8932.913s">Have</a> those exams at this point been canceled?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8977.747s">That</a> was my question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9372.55s">It</a> would be appropriate to add one to the new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9376.712s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9377.377s">If</a> I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9378.157s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9379.178s">I'd</a> like to just mention, of course, that this is the sad, um, you know, today the Boston marathon was supposed to be run and I wanted to certainly remember, uh, Crystal Campbell, uh, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9392.142s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9392.442s">Thank</a> you for that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9478.522s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9479.884s">I</a> just wanted to let you know that on Wednesday, I went up to sign the bills, and I'm standing outside the high school down on the main road was a whole lot of our vocational teachers and other staff from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9496.585s">holding</a> signs to honor Annie Glenn Cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9500.909s">And</a> it was so, so touching and moving to see our teachers making this effort, knowing that it was such an unusual time, that it was different for the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9511.878s">And</a> yet they had gathered together appropriately, social distance, but showing their love for Annie.<h2><a href="../2020-04-02_h6VaG8W1tBc/2020-04-02_h6VaG8W1tBc.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 30, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=195.271s">Member</a> Van der Kloot, present. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=196.411s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2353.759s">Yes,</a> I just was curious whether we've had any discussions with the Japanese Language School in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2361.183s">I</a> do know in previous years, or over the years, they've sometimes been able to work out something where perhaps they would, in fact, pay for the – continue to make their payments this year, of course impacting that next year, then they would – that would be offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2379.413s">But</a> have we had any discussions yet?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2416.332s">I</a> would just be hopeful that we might have a conversation with them and at least negotiate somewhat better terms for us because it's a large number.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2480.5s">Can</a> I continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2484.326s">I</a> think that the question that many of us will have has to do with classes of employees who work for some of the revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2495.417s">And</a> I don't know if you want to address that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2497.978s">I</a> think that's one of the most important things.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2521.253s">Until</a> that time, since it's been put off another week, is everybody being paid in the afterschool and program?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2554.524s">So</a> Kids Corner employees will be- Everybody, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2558.229s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3649.135s">Yes,</a> this is the time of year where there are various other activities that entail contracts, for example, for the junior and senior prom, perhaps for some of the senior activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3661.723s">Has</a> that money already been paid out? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3665.206s">Like,</a> let's take one of the proms, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3668.268s">And</a> is that just so that we don't, so our students don't lose that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3675.213s">Where</a> are we in the process around those type of expenses?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6733.072s">First,</a> I, too, would like to thank everybody for all of their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6736.755s">And</a> I know that so much time you've put together to put together this information for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6745.904s">And</a> it's very much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6749.534s">You</a> know, in this first two weeks, it's been hard to understand what the consistency across the district is. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6757.776s">I</a> had some wonderful conversations with very happy parents about the information their students were getting, and so very, very positive feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6769.119s">But</a> what I don't know was how consistent that was, and whether there were some students who weren't having as good as opportunities as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6780.882s">Now,</a> this obviously now takes this to a different level. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6784.605s">One</a> of my first questions is, is we have lost time, and was there any discussion about what we're gonna do during April vacation had? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6799.578s">No</a> answers, okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6802.792s">I</a> mean, everybody's just assuming April vacation is going to be a no work time, or are we going to reflect on the fact that we've just lost two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6814.103s">Some</a> degrees, how are we going to look at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6816.145s">People</a> aren't going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6817.186s">Kids</a> are going to be home.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6837.299s">So</a> that's something that's going to need to be considered and you know personally I would just hope even if the activities didn't continue that week that there would be you know a list of things for kids to do because if they're going to be home at least have them some level of direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6856.946s">So</a> you know I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6859.787s">just</a> wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6861.047s">And</a> I do realize that this, you know, it's been a recent now that closed till May 4th, you know, and who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6869.709s">We</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6870.449s">We</a> don't know about the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6874.149s">Other</a> questions I had, are teachers coming in to assemble packets of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6879.03s">You</a> mentioned that, you know, we don't want it to be all, is anybody coming into our schools or are they just assembling them at home if they're sending out any information?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6978.753s">You</a> know, I- Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6979.373s">Caldwell?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7032.663s">We</a> are basically at a stay at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7036.245s">So</a> I wouldn't want to jeopardize our teachers in any way, safe words, but I'm asking the question because I don't think, I don't want parents to think that they're necessarily gonna get a packet of information in the mail because I think for many, that's really not real. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7052.112s">So</a> that's why I wanted the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7054.413s">My</a> last sort of topic right now is on guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7059.375s">This</a> is the time period where many of our seniors are receiving, if they haven't already, acceptances. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7067.819s">There</a> will be some kids who are going to need last-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7070.86s">Oh</a> my gosh, I need another recommendation or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7074.644s">And</a> I've just somewhat interested in what guidance is doing and how we're making sure that all of our students, particularly our seniors, are receiving the help that they need during this critical period.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7185.575s">Any</a> idea about applications for the scholarships, the end of year scholarships, which usually are coming in around beginning now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7214.992s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7217.453s">Member</a> Graham.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9919.868s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to inquire about our homeless students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9923.11s">Have</a> we done any outreach to the students who are in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9927.253s">And</a> have we given them any support in particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9932.657s">And</a> who's in charge of doing so?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10326.845s">Yes,</a> so I looked at this and again, I realized that part of it is because of the school vacation week, but I feel very uncomfortable that we would have a meeting on the 13th and then not again to the 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10343.311s">And</a> so I think it's really important that we add a meeting on the 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10348.552s">I</a> don't need a full agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10351.759s">meeting,</a> but I need an opportunity where we are brought together and we can talk and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10357.053s">So</a> I'm not, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10360.47s">it's</a> a long gap and I'm just not comfortable with, this was a very, very long two weeks that your members had. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10369.257s">And</a> we know you were working really hard and we appreciate that, but in our role, that was an extraordinarily long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10376.922s">So</a> when I see that just by chance, and I understand that this is the way it would have been under our regular meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10384.428s">But</a> under this circumstance, I'm just not comfortable with that amount of time between our meetings, especially because, you know, May 4th, we may be starting school again, we don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10521.521s">So</a> the only reason I didn't suggest the 20th was because of the fact that it is during that school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10532.245s">I'm</a> free. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10534.736s">So</a> which of course in today and doesn't exist anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10537.817s">So</a> I'm just mentioning that again, the sense of we have a difference in terms of and this certainly was discussed over these last two weeks in terms of the school committees need <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10551.922s">to</a> be able to talk to each other without having the full agenda, without having the, you know, because I understand and appreciate how much work this meeting is. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10562.476s">How</a> do we set it up so that we have a touch base opportunity?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10656.247s">I'd</a> like my colleagues to weigh in some, and I would like, you know, some concern about the 20th was vacation week so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10663.93s">If</a> you're comfortable, you know, in this one, I'd give to Marisa and say the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10668.811s">It</a> just seems very difficult to have a meeting on the 13th and not again to the 4th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10903.386s">Yeah,</a> I just would like to ask the administrative people whether they're OK with the 20th as opposed to the 13th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11181.226s">Earlier.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11183.856s">Is</a> that you, Janine? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11184.336s">I</a> can't do as early as 3.30, but I could do 4, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11189.759s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11189.879s">4</a> o'clock.<h2><a href="../2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk/2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 9, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=644.088s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=646.643s">So</a> the curriculum subcommittee met on Wednesday, February 26, between 4.30 and 5.30 at the superintendent's conference room in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=655.771s">In</a> attendance were the subcommittee members, myself and Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=660.495s">Mia</a> was absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=661.756s">School</a> committee member Paul Rousseau <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=664.993s">attended</a> the meeting, as did Superintendent Maryse Edward-Vincent, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of PE Health Rachel Puri, and Middle School Parent Michelle Ciccolo. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=682.438s">I</a> called the meeting together at 435 and we saluted the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=686.599s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to review proposed additions to the middle school health curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=691.109s">We</a> received handouts from Rachel Puri, including the table of contents for the national health standards and a table reviewing the current Medford health curriculum with the national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=701.752s">Areas</a> where we were not in alignment were highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=704.853s">Director</a> Puri reviewed the charts with the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=707.733s">Currently</a> we use part of the Michigan model, but now we should be incorporating more areas of the most recent Michigan model edition to cover areas related to sexual health. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=718.703s">We</a> are covering areas such as vaping, alcohol, drug education, nutrition, physical activity, safety, and other areas of social emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=726.833s">Currently,</a> the state standards are not out. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=729.336s">So</a> at present, we need to rely on the national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=732.938s">Director</a> Perry explained the health is offered for a half year in grade six, seventh, and eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=737.48s">The</a> other half of the year, the students receive instruction from guidance in order to cover the new areas of instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=743.964s">In</a> order to cover the new areas of instruction, one full-time health teacher will be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=750.367s">Member</a> Graham asked about the trade-off between students receiving health versus the ability to participate in band or orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=758.132s">Parent</a> Ciccolo noted that her child had no health in sixth grade because of a conflict with orchestra, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=763.143s">In</a> seventh grade, her child traded phys ed in order to get health instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=767.645s">School</a> committee member Rousseau noted that often students on IEPs miss subjects like health. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=773.327s">Assistant</a> Superintendent Peter Cushing said that our kids are under a constant bombardment on vaping and other risky behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=780.89s">He</a> believes a trained health professional is of highest priority, a must have. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=785.712s">Guiding</a> staff not trained to teach these health areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=789.066s">The</a> superintendent concurred and noted that budget decisions are going to be tough because of the many needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=794.768s">Since</a> the new curriculum covers areas related to sex education, such as gender identity, anatomy, puberty, and contraception, all parents will receive the opt-out notification, which the district has used for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=807.592s">The</a> sequencing of the curriculum will be given careful consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=810.855s">The</a> high school ninth grade health class will be reviewed and updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=814.759s">Scheduling</a> at the middle school is challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=816.941s">Member</a> Graham offered the following statement to summarize our current position. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=821.325s">We</a> recognize that there are scheduling issues that mean parents have to make choices that we would rather they did not have to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=828.891s">We</a> are very aware of the issues and are working to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=832.443s">Motion</a> by Member Graham, seconded by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=835.284s">The</a> Curriculum Subcommittee recommends that the school committee adopt Growing Up and Staying Healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements in order to assure that we are aligned with the national health standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=848.648s">Roll</a> call was Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=850.849s">Van</a> der Kloot, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=851.789s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=851.91s">Stone</a> was absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=853.15s">Motion</a> to adjourn at 5.30 by Member Graham and seconded by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=858.252s">And</a> the motion passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=860.478s">So</a> we would like to make a motion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=864.482s">We</a> would ask that the school committee adopt, recommendation is that we adopt growing up, the subcommittee recommendation is that we adopt growing up and staying healthy, the Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.12s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.681s">I</a> think there were resources that the teachers would be using. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=909.388s">They</a> were not specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=911.45s">However,</a> we did address the needs of the fact that there was concerns about getting the curriculum to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=918.298s">And</a> that's one of the reasons why the recommendation is to add a full-time health <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=924.817s">teacher</a> at that level, because we need to be more comprehensive in our ability to deliver the information to students, all students.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1089.939s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1092.703s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1101.693s">»»</a> Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1102.033s">Can</a> I make a clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.153s">»»</a> Sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.993s">»»</a> The reason I motioned to table it was because a member asked for additional information that I did not provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1112.115s">Because</a> typically when we've had a handout we don't always provide it that's not customary. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1117.576s">But</a> I didn't provide it and since a member asked for that information and we didn't provide it, that's why I made the motion to lay it on the table.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1157.87s">Well,</a> if I may, there's also a budget piece of getting a, whether we're going to approve the additional health personnel, which is going to make this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1168.855s">Um,</a> I absolutely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1171.356s">I</a> think that as soon as a member requests a piece of information, I mean, the mayor just said, I don't feel comfortable voting on it unless I see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1179.76s">Um,</a> so, uh, it would be as you and I both being on the subcommittee, we very, very much want to see this go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1186.244s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1187.546s">At</a> this point, I'm willing to wait for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1189.888s">I</a> would not have to read the minutes again. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1191.529s">We</a> would just have to bring it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1197.833s">So</a> I'll lay it on the table to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1201.296s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1390.365s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1391.929s">I'd</a> like to ask for suspension of, oh, sorry, not yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1395.731s">Hold</a> on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1623.316s">Member</a> van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1626.338s">I</a> had a question about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1629.239s">I</a> also, I guess my first question is, did the subcommittee endorse, I don't see a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1638.444s">Was</a> there, sorry, where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1646.608s">And</a> was it a three to one vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1649.129s">Or</a> a three to zero vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1650.049s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1652.122s">So</a> I have a question about, okay, here, I see it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1656.665s">I</a> have a question about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1661.328s">It</a> appears that it gives the superintendent or her designee within two normal school days to respond with the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1673.257s">You</a> know, when I'm up there signing the bills on Wednesday, I have to say that my observation is that people are running, running, running, juggling so many balls in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1685.042s">I</a> don't think two normal school days is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1688.423s">I</a> understand everybody thinks that whatever they have, as do I, is the most pressing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1695.206s">But</a> I don't think that's real to hold the superintendent to, and I don't want her to be under pressure to simply <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1703.32s">designating</a> something to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1705.301s">And</a> then sometimes she may need to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1708.281s">So</a> I don't find two days to be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1712.622s">I</a> would ask the superintendent, since this affects you directly, is what sort of timeline you would think would be reasonable?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2331.917s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2333.72s">Sure,</a> so first I want to say I do appreciate the work that the subcommittee did on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2338.543s">The</a> superintendent has indicated her willingness to try it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2343.867s">My</a> concern, again, just stands, perhaps I would change it to three normal school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2349.011s">I'm</a> trying to work through my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2350.632s">Okay,</a> it's written on Sunday, it gets sent so it's received Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2354.935s">That</a> means the expectation is that it would get answered by Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2358.633s">afternoon,</a> but all hell breaks out loose on Monday and Tuesday they're running about. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2363.757s">So,</a> you know, again, part of me just, I absolutely understand, you know, what the intent is and I think we are all reasonable people, but I'm always concerned when we write policy like this that someone then could come along and be holding, hold the superintendent to something that we agreed would be flexible and we're trying out. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2388.664s">And</a> so, to me, it just seems very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2392.626s">And</a> I'd be more comfortable with a three-day return, personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2398.569s">I</a> would go, certainly, with asking the rest of the school committee whether, you know, I'll make a motion that the response within three normal school days as opposed to two, and you either vote up or down, and I'm happy to take whatever the consensus is. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2415.037s">So</a> I make a motion, if anybody wants to <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2417.901s">you</a> know, approve it or second it, that'd be three. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2423.042s">Okay,</a> thank you, Kathy.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2942.275s">All</a> in favor.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3337.737s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3339.199s">I</a> also wanted to add my thanks Diane and not only for all of your years but I have to emphasize for the last two years because you really were the constant in the office who helped us through the transition of superintendents and that was just an incredibly important <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3356.339s">role</a> for you to play and you know you could have looked around and said oh I don't think so but instead you chose to stay and to be the transition link and so I think for that not only for that but also for your many years back I remember when you were teaching at the Curtis Tufts and I always thought you were something special so thank you very very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4535.941s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.622s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.962s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4540.044s">Yes,</a> I'd like to go back and talk about the coronavirus more. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4545.646s">What</a> I'm particularly interested in is our proactive plans to talk about education if we were to have to close the schools for a week or two or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4559.95s">I</a> mean, at this point, I understand it's speculative, but I think planning would help.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4607.52s">Great,</a> I'd love to see homework packets put together, you know, and if possible, or even, you know, read with your child two times for 20 minutes every day or something while whatever break we're on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4632.631s">And</a> the other concern I have, just with that, that goes hand in hand, is that some of our students are reliant on two meals a day through the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4644.027s">And</a> at least, like I'm thinking at the high school level, we've got the pantry. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4649.404s">could</a> those students be encouraged to take more? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4652.987s">And</a> if the pantry needs more food, could you put a call out to the community so we can fill it up right now so that there's more food available? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4661.395s">And</a> I'm thinking about other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4663.036s">I</a> mean, all of a sudden, you know, we have students who would be home and not accessing our food. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4667.981s">How</a> can we make sure that we're being proactive and thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4671.863s">supplying</a> some food to families that might be in a particular vulnerable place. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4680.246s">So</a> anyway, I'm glad to hear the administrators are getting together tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4684.388s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4731.548s">So</a> I'm hoping that we will do this, send home information so that we don't get to a Monday morning and all of a sudden cancel and the kids haven't received anything on Friday afternoon.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5457.154s">to</a> something my colleague said that there would be our teachers and staff and whatever would continue on their regular pay scale as per contract whether we close or not that that would not affect our personnel in terms of being paid and it I'm not sure that's what you said but that's what it sounded like okay just want to be clear
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5510.68s">The</a> blessing is right now is that we have quite a number of days still left. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5515.864s">So</a> because of the light snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5518.185s">But</a> saying that, I probably, there was a year, so I won't say anything.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5963.47s">So</a> did all of the students buy the cancel for any reason insurance?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5969.953s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5970.393s">And</a> at this point in the time window, do I understand they'll only get 50% back? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.315s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.956s">And</a> we've had no talks with the company to say whether that could be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6024.874s">So</a> within that, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6028.095s">In</a> terms of the airfare, some airlines are allowing waves or will give credit for future trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6036.498s">What</a> were you planning on flying?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6068.881s">I</a> hope that we could look into that, because it's quite a hit for a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6072.763s">I</a> mean, it's a disappointment for students, and I feel terrible about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6077.685s">And</a> so anything that we can at least get the most money back for the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6084.44s">thought</a> or discussion of saying, could we do the trip during the summer instead?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6240.74s">Thank</a> you for all your work and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6242.481s">And</a> I can feel your pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6243.942s">So</a> I really appreciate your thoughtful answer and the fact that you had to make this tough decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6250.225s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9285.644s">I</a> believe I can concur with Melanie on many of the points that she makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9294.437s">It's</a> not reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9295.278s">It</a> never was a reasonable timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9298.323s">It</a> seems ludicrous that they're asking for such a quick return across the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9303.526s">My</a> mom used to say, it never hurts to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9306.167s">So</a> I think putting together a well-crafted letter saying we would respectfully ask you for more time, we don't believe that this is an adequate amount of time for us to engage our families and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9318.293s">I</a> mean, I would absolutely submit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9320.655s">I</a> would actually go further and talk to the other <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9323.476s">superintendents</a> who are also grappling with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9325.939s">Maybe</a> there's a few who've managed to figure it out, but I bet there's a whole lot of superintendents trying to slam this together, as we will be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9335.428s">But</a> on the other hand, I'm not willing to leave money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9339.151s">And</a> so I think we need to go ahead and send it to the engagement committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9343.173s">I</a> think we need to write the letter because nothing ventured, nothing gained, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9347.955s">That</a> we should do that and hope for the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9351.057s">And</a> in the meantime, do whatever work we can do so that we are prepared to file what we have, whether it's perfect or not, because I'm not going to leave $138,000 on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9362.683s">I</a> can think of many, many different things that we've talked in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9367.225s">that</a> might be helpful to our students and to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9372.247s">So,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9373.828s">Point</a> of clarification, member Ruseau.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2828.267s">Do</a> we want to suspend, before we go on to this order of business, do we want to suspend the rules and continue our meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2837.25s">What</a> would you like to suspend the rules for? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2840.051s">Right,</a> because this is going to take some time to read it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2843.242s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2844.143s">Okay,</a> so I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules so we can pick up the two departments that were not heard yet from our pre budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2855.058s">Yes,</a> motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3599.472s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3600.733s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3603.157s">Mr.</a> Seary, I just want to go back to the issue of the ninth grade biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3608.4s">So</a> of course, as you know, for many, many years, biology was the ninth grade subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3613.482s">And</a> in fact, the physics was changed to the ninth grade subject because of the fact that the students needed to take a ninth grade <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3624.406s">science</a> MCAS and it was thought that the physics was more approachable maybe or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3632.372s">Anyway,</a> I'm glad to see biology coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3635.194s">I</a> think it fits well in the ninth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3637.056s">I</a> think all students should be able to take it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3639.978s">But</a> I am wondering about the change of thinking about will the students then take the biology MCAS in ninth grade?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3653.481s">Okay,</a> and so will our teachers who were teaching biology in an upper grade now come teach it to ninth graders?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3664.69s">And</a> will the physics <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3669.214s">Will</a> there still be that introductory physics, or will physics be left?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3739.226s">Will</a> we have any earth science course at all offered?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3766.669s">And</a> this change will happen in September?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3770.271s">September</a> 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3772.153s">That's</a> with relatively quick, but I imagine that your staff is all on board for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3777.277s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3779.018s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4615.638s">So</a> with the change in the Italian consulate covering the money for the paraprofessionals, I think that we need to have a discussion about how we will use that time, whether we'll continue <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4635.881s">as</a> we are or whether there's something else that's needed in the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4642.525s">I</a> don't know how much time people have yet from the administrative have been able to consider the options and what might be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4651.329s">I</a> would make a motion to send this topic to the curriculum subcommittee meeting once people are ready to address it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5101.786s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5102.847s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5103.868s">I</a> second the motion and thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5105.769s">Gozmez</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5106.75s">This</a> is not the first year she's done it and we appreciate her generosity and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5111.033s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5111.513s">Great.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5850.914s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5851.134s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5853.416s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5854.697s">Yes,</a> my questions are concerning the students left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5861.605s">Mr.</a> Tucci, you noted that the kids, you were thinking of a trip to the Medford High School swimming pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5868.31s">And</a> is that the same thought for the Andrews students?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5889.125s">Yeah,</a> I understand that for many students, maybe going to the high school pool is great, but not all students know how to swim. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5897.55s">And</a> part of me says going to New York City for the weekend versus going to the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5903.354s">I</a> think that students used to go into Boston or have something outside of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5910.519s">So</a> I'm just sort of curious about that choice.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5942.123s">For</a> kids who either didn't know how to swim or was there a swimming assessment? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5947.372s">How</a> did how did we handle that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5965.828s">I</a> mean, I absolutely can understand that it would be great, and if it is great, I wouldn't want to change it, but I certainly feel like I need to ask about it, because it is, you know, it's just not as great as going to New York City. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5979.578s">no</a> matter how much we might love the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5981.718s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6001.383s">So</a> on that motion, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6004.236s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6004.776s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6005.617s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6006.417s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6007.457s">Member</a> Mustone is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6009.578s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6014.18s">Member</a> Vanderkloot, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6016.32s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6162.564s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6163.705s">If</a> the trip needs to be canceled at the last minute for any reason, what is the policy regarding a refund?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6201.207s">And</a> while I'm at it, for the New York trip, if there was a cancellation, is there insurance to cover that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6213.116s">I</a> thought we required that there would be.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6228.178s">You</a> are talking to the person whose child was in the grade when the trip was canceled and they stayed at the Medford Hotel rather than being able to go to New York City. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6237.48s">So</a> a little concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6242.321s">Could</a> you just check into it and maybe we'll talk, clarify?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6247.242s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6247.842s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6249.423s">Member</a> Graham.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8705.938s">Yes,</a> and I realize that it is somewhat amusing that the Curriculum Subcommittee, which will speak to ECRI, has not yet been reported out yet, only because of the suspensions that we've had this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8717.59s">But</a> we will get to it and explain a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8721.935s">So</a> in the notes <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8726.572s">First</a> results were given to parents for grade one and two in November, and then kindergarten parents have now, they've all received some results. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8737.659s">So</a> I'm curious whether initially we were <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8741.804s">surprised</a> at the number of kids, or it was what we expected, or no, it was lower than we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8747.866s">I</a> was sort of curious about your initial reactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8750.207s">And</a> then I'm wondering if we have supports to help students right away who were red flagged in this process.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8851.629s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8852.329s">And</a> how about what you're seeing initially?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8894.822s">And</a> then lastly, where then becomes the line where we determine that a student is <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8903.584s">is</a> dyslexic or severely dyslexic so that they need more than classroom supports, but they need a specialized, maybe special education support.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8969.565s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8971.126s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8971.966s">Thank</a> you for all your work.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11286.374s">I</a> guess sort of remembering the discussion last year with all good intentions that we would want to provide instruction to people, because as Member Graham says, it's an incredible responsibility and there's a lot of reporting things that you need to do when all of a sudden you're the treasurer and you need to make sure you're following all the guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11308.906s">But</a> in fact, what I see, and I think Paul has just touched on it, is that right now we notice <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11315.473s">I</a> mean, our people are working hard, and they're pretty tapped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11319.655s">So</a> I don't know how we can possibly ask someone within to pursue this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11329.561s">However,</a> I think that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11331.802s">It's</a> worthwhile to talk to the MASC and ask them whether any of their member districts, what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11336.885s">We</a> might reach out to some other school committees and see whether they give any training. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11343.368s">I</a> mean, if there's something <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11344.894s">that</a> already exists would be so much more preferable than having to spend any time putting something together, even if that would be a great thing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11505.7s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11506.26s">Member</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11507.321s">So</a> I'll reach out to the MASC and at least ask the question there of whether they know of any training, whether that's a voice where we can get a message out saying, hey, does your school system do something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11521.783s">So</a> that at least we can start sort of saying, is there anything around that we could adopt? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11530.264s">So</a> I'll do that first piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11532.025s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11532.865s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11720.79s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to make this the short version because of the long hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11726.594s">But</a> you've heard ECRI being referred to any number of times this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11743.071s">Associate</a> Superintendent Diane Caldwell welcomed everybody and she explained that there would be, on March 3rd, a half day of professional development session conducted by Hill for literacy and professional development would continue next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11765.665s">ECRI</a> materials consist of downloadable PDFs for classroom instruction and full district implementation is expected to occur at the beginning of next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11777.651s">We</a> received two handouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11780.373s">Dr.</a> Chiesa spoke about ECRI as a multi-tiered program, Tier 1 and Tier 2, featuring a series of teaching routines designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of reading instruction in K-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11795.119s">The</a> program is being introduced to improve student achievement in word reading and comprehension, fluency, and phonological awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11804.144s">Tier</a> one of the program is whole group instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11806.505s">Tier</a> two is targeted intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11809.427s">Our</a> teacher, Kristen Howell, title one at the Columbus, worked with ECRIB this past summer through a grant in conjunction with DESE and spoke highly of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11818.792s">Also</a> at our meeting, Michelle Donahue, a Medford resident and a teacher in another district, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11823.94s">spoke</a> to her very positive experience with ECRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11826.842s">Her</a> district uses a different reading program than Medford's journeys, but they have the same concerns about foundational weaknesses that we are seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11835.006s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11835.186s">Donaghy</a> brought her teaching materials and explained facets of the day-to-day implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11840.409s">She</a> sees it as something that easily fit into her current teaching and bolstered her students' understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11846.512s">Member</a> Graham asked when the Journeys Program would be evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11850.154s">A</a> discussion about the complexity of implementing all the new curriculum pieces followed, and we covered that some in our budget meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11858.44s">Dr.</a> Keyes explained that it was essential not to overwhelm teachers while other new curriculums were being adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11866.044s">Member</a> van der Kloot asked Director Teixeira whether ECRI program would be useful for EL, and he explained he responded in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11875.25s">Parent</a> Sharon Hayes expressed some concerns with Journey's approach to the teaching of combination letter sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11881.534s">Diane</a> Caldwell noted that the cost of ECRI is $275 per level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11885.961s">The</a> combined cost came to $3,300, and the cost would be covered by Title I funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11892.583s">The</a> motion was accepted, was made to accept ECRI, was made by myself and seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11898.724s">Stone,</a> and the motion passed three to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11901.485s">The</a> chair asked about upcoming topics, and we have a list, elementary, ELA, and math, suggestion to create the overall map of the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11910.892s">We</a> reviewed, we suggested we talk about civic standards in fourth and eighth grade, the amount of assessments, possibly reviewing elementary Italian program, and win assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11922.737s">And</a> we adjourned at 6.59 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11926.978s">I</a> would like to add to this and announce that we have another curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday at 4.30, between 4.30 and 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11937.038s">The</a> purpose is to discuss proposed changes to the middle school health curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11941.701s">So</a> we'll be meeting this week again, okay?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11947.765s">It</a> will be up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11949.105s">Medford</a> High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11950.226s">It</a> would be appropriate for the school committee to endorse the adoption of ECRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11960.713s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the proposed adoption of ECRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11968.548s">Member</a> McLaughlin.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1840.168s">Yes,</a> I think my colleagues have summed up many of the discussion points, but I feel particularly disheartened to hear from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1846.973s">Donlon</a> that any student felt that they were getting negative feedback because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1853.398s">And</a> I just want to say, and add my voice, that I applaud you for coming forward and for advocating for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1859.122s">That</a> is exactly what we want you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1861.524s">And</a> we're appreciative of your time and presence here this evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2173.556s">While</a> we heard from students involved in the after school program, we have other students who work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2179.64s">And</a> it would only be equitable to understand the full breadth of student employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2186.705s">For</a> instance, we have students who are lifeguards. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2188.527s">That's</a> part of the motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2894.273s">I</a> have several things to bring to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2897.434s">At</a> our last school committee meeting, Member McLaughlin asked, and it was reflected in our minutes, about the conversations with non-English speaking families from the health office, and we talked about a translation service that were used. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2916.081s">So</a> I pulled one of the bills so that you could see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2920.103s">I</a> want to note that the names that are on it are not student names. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2923.644s">They</a> are, in fact, the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2925.185s">But</a> I thought you would just be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2927.026s">You</a> can see that sometimes the conference is only two minutes, and sometimes it's 14 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2933.571s">But</a> this is that we employ a service to help with the translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2938.074s">So</a> I brought that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2939.195s">I'm</a> going to pass them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2940.396s">And</a> I would ask that they all, they are copies, but if you just return them to me, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2945.399s">Secondarily,</a> and this is kind of an ode to my former colleague, our former colleague, Erinda Benedetto, I pulled a bill that was for professional cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2957.45s">Whenever</a> I see professional odor remediation services that piqued my interest so I followed it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2964.436s">It</a> had to do with the Curtis-Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2966.878s">They</a> had a problem in the library classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2970.702s">So</a> on December 26th, when students were not in the building, they brought in ServPro to help remediate that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2979.889s">And</a> so you'll see that bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2983.251s">Lastly,</a> I just thought you might be interested that we have received new textbooks for our students for our civic education in grade 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2991.537s">And</a> I brought in the bills for you to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2993.978s">Unfortunately,</a> much to my dismay, I realized that they are already out of date as I couldn't help but look under impeach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3001.799s">And</a> it mentioned that only, you know, two presidents have been impeached. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3006.46s">And</a> so, we are obviously, our teachers are going to have to update that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3011.601s">But</a> there is also a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3012.981s">So,</a> I brought them in just so you could see and know that these resources have been brought to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3018.843s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3038.802s">One</a> further thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3040.342s">I</a> just want to extend again an invitation to any other member. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3044.083s">I've</a> been getting there on Wednesdays about 10, 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3047.263s">And</a> if anybody does want to join me, if you give me a heads up, then I'll make sure my timing's more exact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3051.944s">But</a> please do feel free to come and join on Wednesdays up at the high school.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5943.644s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5944.833s">Member</a> van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5946.734s">Just</a> one thing in the timeline that doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5950.157s">I</a> note that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form is due on March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5957.322s">But</a> the open houses, the three of them occur after that deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5964.247s">So</a> for me, it would make more sense for the sibling opt-in, opt-out form to be sent home, to be due on March 11th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6040.704s">But,</a> you know, with... If it would work such that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6047.749s">is</a> not a drop-dead, but which is to say that instead they'd be collected with the ideal on March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6054.731s">But</a> if there were forms that were not turned in, there would be follow-up with the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6060.473s">I</a> would be comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6064.274s">But</a> that's a procedural thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6066.014s">If</a> it's meant that if the parent doesn't return the form by that date, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6072.859s">then</a> I'm not particular, you know, one way or the other, then I'm not particularly comfortable with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6077.825s">But</a> I assume you'd be following up with it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6089.133s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6090.214s">If</a> you can make that, that makes them more comfortable with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6095.4s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7998.591s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8004.832s">I</a> support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8006.713s">It</a> sounds like where we're heading is that we're going to need to do some specialized preschool information directed to preschool parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8016.98s">Especially,</a> we have the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8019.061s">We</a> have parents we can outreach to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8022.383s">And</a> I know one year I went and I was very disheartened by how many of those parents, it just happened that year, were going to charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8033.214s">So</a> it seems like with the feedback from my colleagues that it's definitely time to think about an earlier outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8042.384s">I</a> think that these presentations are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8044.466s">I</a> know the staff does a fabulous job on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8048.491s">But</a> clearly, we're going to need to think about sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8053.116s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9562.335s">Yes,</a> so thank you for all the work to the team who's been putting and working on this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9568.62s">Just</a> for our clarity, I believe my understanding is that for each of the bullets, you'd hyperlink to a page that would outline in detail the steps needed <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9581.454s">to</a> achieve and the person in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9587.178s">Of</a> the bullets that we have here, roughly 16, 17, how many have we done that next step for? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9596.585s">Or</a> is that the next step?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9692.012s">If</a> I can just follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9693.793s">Moving</a> forward, what do you envision now? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9696.576s">Do</a> you envision it going to the subcommittee?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9816.201s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11294.135s">I,</a> now that we've officially. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11297.077s">She</a> loves that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11297.718s">You're</a> promoted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11298.398s">I'm</a> out of here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11310.848s">So,</a> given that we are now official, I'd like to <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11317.413s">Announce</a> that the curriculum subcommittee is going to meet on Wednesday at 6 o'clock between 6 and 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11325.801s">We</a> are meeting at the request of associate superintendent Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11331.92s">for</a> a presentation on enhanced core reading instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11337.081s">We</a> did the unusual step of going ahead and setting up the meeting prior to sending it to the subcommittee officially from this body because of a timeline issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11348.024s">So</a> I hope that no one has any concern or objection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11352.645s">So</a> that will be on this Wednesday, February 5th at 6 o'clock up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11359.312s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11360.052s">Also,</a> while we're under this, I noticed that we haven't yet received any appointees to the vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11367.877s">And</a> I just want to ask the mayor what her intention was about that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11393.575s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11394.415s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11848.657s">May</a> I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.282s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.382s">I</a> just wanna make sure, this is one of those circumstances where we have a meeting immediately after a vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11861.902s">And</a> so given that timeline, is that meeting the best meeting to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11871.135s">Are</a> you prepared at that point?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11894.163s">I</a> only raise it only because of the fact it is right after, and you know, some people are on vacation, but not all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11901.645s">Anyway,</a> thank you, and I would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11904.027s">So</a> motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11905.949s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11972.463s">I</a> think the point of sending it to the subcommittee is so you can argue it out there about saying what makes sense to send, what's an ad hoc report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11985.552s">and</a> does something like this qualify and how do you discern? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11989.454s">So</a> that's kind of my thinking about it is that there'll be multiple interesting discussions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12000.158s">That's</a> why it's going to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12006.281s">Not</a> this resolution, what she's referring to with the ad hoc report, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12013.924s">Yeah,</a> future resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12019.488s">Well,</a> you're going to have to figure that out.<h2><a href="../2020-01-15_l7UJNCM5bg4/2020-01-15_l7UJNCM5bg4.html">Medford School Committee January 13, 2020 meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6997.12s">So</a> Christina, I wanted to go back to your main report and on the back you noted we drew down from the following accounts as identified during the FY19 budget development progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7008.407s">Do</a> you have numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7009.568s">And</a> I understand you might not have with them tonight, but can you tell me from the after school program <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7014.771s">how</a> much money was used to offset other programs?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7030.44s">And</a> the before school, do you have those?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7035.263s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7046.031s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7093.103s">Okay,</a> so really the major one really is the before and after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7096.784s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7097.204s">Of</a> about a half a million dollars that is used to offset other accounts.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7104.846s">Right,</a> so it's less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7105.866s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7106.647s">However,</a> it still leaves us the question of saying is that what we want with the tuitions and how else can we, should our budget be expanded so it really reflects real costs rather than the need to do creative fundraising.<h2><a href="../2019-12-18_jsdIPdqDPt8/2019-12-18_jsdIPdqDPt8.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 16, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2929.074s">I</a> agree that limiting the goals was in fact an excellent plan and really gave focus to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2935.178s">And</a> rest assured, we certainly will be <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2939.011s">making</a> sure that the work continues and will be focused and will continue along the lines, the trajectory that you started us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2946.214s">Thank</a> you, Erin.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2993.777s">Mayor</a> Burke, I would like to make a motion to suspend the order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2997.238s">I'd</a> like to take superintendent's updates and comments at the end of our <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3001.307s">calendar,</a> please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3423.546s">You've</a> always been there for us and one of the things is that so often we are just in sync with our thinking and it's absolutely a pleasure and I thought this is such a great time to recognize the work that you do not only for the Student Opportunities Act <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3443.575s">but</a> every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3445.236s">Of</a> course, we're going to need your continued work and to advocate for us to make sure, you know, there's those dirty words, subject to appropriation, and we want to make sure that, in fact, where the places are, we can maximize the benefit for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3462.783s">So</a> thank you very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3464.044s">I</a> was hoping that we could all do a picture with your bells in front here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3469.126s">So</a> take them out again, and let's ring the bell for education.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3588.0s">I</a> know.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4348.65s">I</a> just wanted to comment because I was a colleague of Lena's for such a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4353.673s">And</a> Lena was a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4357.635s">My</a> most wonderful memory was when Lena, in her high heels, because Lena was always dressed to the T, and I climbed to every roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4367.24s">And</a> this is when the Osgoode was still standing, so we're talking many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4371.582s">We</a> climbed to the top of every roof and examined them ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4375.764s">This</a> was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4377.005s">the</a> schools were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4378.565s">This</a> was way before that, as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4381.266s">And</a> Lena was going to never let anything stop her. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4385.968s">I</a> thought Lena would have been so happy in her own right because, you know, it's a Monday and Lena is being waked tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4392.709s">I</a> went to the wake earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4394.21s">And</a> she used to love when the music played. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4396.891s">And</a> Lena was, we didn't always agree, but Lena was passionate about education. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4406.029s">And</a> so we send our heartfelt condolences to her family and memories of the many years that she decked these halls.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4528.2s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4534.083s">I</a> have a few words to say, which is traditional. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4538.865s">It's</a> always a bittersweet moment when we come to this place and we recognize the work of our fellow colleagues, but also know that change is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4548.869s">Michael,</a> you and I stood out together this election day, all day, from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4557.332s">And</a> there was no way that I was going to let you leave one minute before me and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4562.634s">But</a> we had a wonderful time talking and chatting with each other and I thought, boy, what a benefit this was. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4568.041s">And</a> during that time, I really appreciated as I talked to you and heard what a passionate dad you are to your two wonderful sons and a husband to your lovely wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4580.357s">It</a> was, you brought a breath of fresh air to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4583.301s">It's</a> not every day that we have a blueberry farmer amongst us, and that was something that I think was always interesting to your colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4591.27s">We</a> always want to know more. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4592.632s">And</a> to that end, tonight I'm bringing you Mr. Ashley's blueberries, which happened to be on sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4598.859s">At</a> the school committee conference, I kid you not, I couldn't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4602.724s">It</a> is a lovely, lovely book. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4605.347s">And</a> I am sure that you're going to enjoy reading it to your young sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4610.632s">And</a> Michael, I think this is hardly the last that we're going to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4613.756s">Your</a> time here has been relatively brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4616.619s">But</a> I think that you've probably, I certainly was enriched by your presence and I hope that you've enjoyed your stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4624.305s">And</a> I suspect very, very much that we will hear more from you in the future and that you will continue your outspoken passion for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4634.153s">Specifically,</a> Michael, as you talked about reelection, you mentioned your concern about the obesity epidemic for children, and that, of course, brings into it also the concerns about exercise and recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4646.857s">And</a> so as one of the members who is continuing on, I promise you that I will take up that mantle and continue it so that your work and thoughts in that direction will be continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4657.381s">Michael,</a> thank you so much for your tenure, for being here, and for being one of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4662.403s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4664.777s">We're</a> not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4667.14s">So,</a> Erin, I can't believe that eight years have passed because it seems like just yesterday that you joined our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4674.007s">And</a> I'm having a hard time with that processing that really you've been on the committee eight years, and I'm probably having an even harder time believing that you're leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4685.297s">I</a> want to thank you, too, for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4687.239s">You</a> know, it's not only just you, but also we got to meet and become friends with your wonderful husband, Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4696.846s">We</a> heard about Caitlin and Joey. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4699.148s">We</a> lived just through one wedding and know that there's another wedding upcoming and house buying and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4704.612s">And</a> I remember them when they were so much younger, and you were, sorry, younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4711.899s">active</a> parent, well I'm older so it's okay, active parent, a band parent, I remember all your work for the prom dress and mostly I think that your work for the Curtis Tufts <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4724.778s">keeping</a> that school in vision, in mind, saying, how are we going to approve it? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4729.399s">We</a> need new shades, we need the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4731.66s">It</a> was just each meeting, we wondered what else you would come up with because you were intent of making sure that that work would be done, just as you were with the special education subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4742.442s">Your</a> tenacity, your thoughtfulness, we didn't always agree, but within that, we certainly had a level of respect with each other, and that's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4755.005s">I</a> really appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4756.386s">So,</a> Erin, I too believe, like Michael, that you will continue on and be very active in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4763.653s">I'm</a> not quite sure exactly how that's going to turn out, which direction you're going to go in, but I know that it will be one that you will work very hard at as you find <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4775.062s">your</a> passion and I also believe strongly that you are not over for education and that we will see you here in these halls again. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4783.606s">Erin,</a> thank you for your dedication and your time and your commitment to the children of Medford.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4855.834s">I</a> now want to turn to Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4861.967s">who</a> has been a fantastic mayor for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4865.67s">But</a> more importantly for us, for this contingent, for these people sitting here, you have been a fantastic chair of the Medford School Committee, and we thank you so very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4876.28s">It's</a> not been the easiest of four years, but your accomplishments have been great, and you have ruled with steadfast <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4884.868s">Eye</a> on the prize, passion in the direction of what's best for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4890.053s">The</a> time, and I know that you've said it, but more was seeing you with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4893.936s">I</a> know how much you loved going to the schools and seeing and being with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4898.08s">And</a> believe me, you'll always be welcome in our halls because you have a natural ability with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4905.947s">And</a> it was just wonderful to see that piece of you, which I hadn't known before. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4911.252s">But</a> your accomplishments, of course, are bigger, although we have to recognize that one of the key things of your administration is that we made a transfer from a very longstanding superintendent, Mr. Belson, and made a commitment to a search <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4929.488s">to</a> be open, to be inclusive, and we, under your direction, we were able to identify and bring in Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4940.334s">And</a> I certainly think that you should keep that as high on your accomplishment list. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4945.558s">Not</a> to mention, by the way, I drove by the <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4951.681s">police</a> building going up and I saw the light shining and of course I also have the luxury of driving past the library renovation which will also have your fingerprints on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4967.238s">It's</a> hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4969.24s">to</a> say goodbye, but again we hope that you'll play a very active role in Medford in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4976.143s">We</a> appreciate so much that, I mean I can't say enough, but that sense of professionalism of keeping what is important for the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4987.309s">How</a> do we proceed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4988.829s">How</a> do we move on <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4990.451s">and</a> through and make the best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4996.299s">Thank</a> you for your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4997.682s">Thank</a> you for your friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4999.544s">Thank</a> you for being you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3294.448s">First,</a> I'll start at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3295.608s">I</a> want to thank you, Michael and Rich, for coming tonight and for updating us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3300.57s">Of</a> course, we know what a positive thing this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3303.932s">And</a> as I've been sitting here and reading some of the other projects that happened at the elementary level, something else occurred to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3310.954s">So</a> first, at the elementary level, I happened to look in my book and one was teal pumpkin awareness for letting the community know more about the teal pumpkins means on Halloween, that there are non-food items available in case kids have allergies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3328.705s">And</a> another one, you know, more books for little free libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3332.507s">We</a> see the little free libraries <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3334.468s">popping</a> up, but not enough kids books. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3336.049s">So</a> that was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3337.51s">And</a> all of a sudden, as I was thinking about this, I was thinking, because of course, we know what fantastic high school projects we've had and how wonderful you just represented yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3348.577s">But</a> when I go to the music concerts, one of the things I'm always struck about is how when people, students get up at that spring concert, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3358.843s">They</a> often thank the music teachers because it is the music teachers who have continuity from the elementary to the middle to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3368.808s">And</a> what we've now managed to build with the CCSR is that there's a continuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3375.792s">of</a> ideals going from the elementary to the middle to the high school and soon because of this while the time the kids get to the high school of course we'll always be welcoming more new high school students but we'll also be building the space that will come up <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3391.742s">And</a> that's an incredibly powerful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3394.463s">So</a> I'm very appreciative of the success that we've had and the building that we've done over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3401.544s">I</a> did just want to mention to Marie, I read an article, I believe it was the Boston Globe, just a week or so ago, talking about how difficult it was that while our students from less <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3415.447s">Students</a> perhaps who come from families who were their first time college students, while they might get into college, it's difficult for them to stay into college and they're not necessarily prepared for all of the challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3428.05s">And</a> laying that base now for them to be able to talk to college students is just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3434.112s">All</a> of the projects we heard tonight were wonderful and I can't wait to hear about all the other ones that will be happening from all the levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3441.613s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3444.751s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3841.182s">is</a> that you'll come and sit over there in that chair, and you can ask us any questions that you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3846.324s">You</a> can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3847.704s">And</a> if you have any questions before a meeting, we'd be happy to, you know, please reach out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3853.726s">Your</a> voice is extremely important, and I am so glad we are finally getting this student voice back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3859.068s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3859.808s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4363.561s">I</a> just want to say the exact same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4365.302s">So</a> thank you, Molly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4520.21s">Yes,</a> I just want to make sure that a letter is sent on behalf of the school committee to Mr. Hoff and family for their, at this time, thanking them for the incredibly generous donation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4700.74s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4701.02s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4702.18s">I</a> just want to mention that I'm grateful that Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson put in the grant for this, because this is money that certainly can be used and will be very practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4717.345s">So</a> my thanks to her, and I'm glad we're going to be able to go forward with upgrading some of our equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4725.527s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6621.664s">So</a> I want to say my colleagues have done a wonderful job of covering the basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6625.986s">I</a> want to go a little bit further, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6628.088s">Erwin,</a> with yours, I would like to make a motion that we receive a financial report about the after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6636.453s">Specifically,</a> I want to know what income comes out, what our expenses are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6640.214s">I</a> want to know what staff are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6642.875s">I</a> want it to be as thorough and clear so that the committee really understands what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6649.476s">In</a> the past, I believe that some of the money that we took in was used for other expenses in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6655.998s">I</a> think we need to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6657.998s">I'm</a> concerned because obviously staffing is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6662.939s">And</a> we mentioned the high school rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6665.72s">And,</a> you know, I totally understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6669.082s">You</a> said you have $14 for an assistant group leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6671.884s">Well,</a> you know, anybody can go to Whole Foods now and start at $15. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6678.249s">And</a> this is not a position which comes with benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6682.251s">And</a> so it may be a position that even though we may be competitive with other after school programs, the fact of the matter is that if maybe we have to be better than competitive, maybe we have to be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6698.021s">My</a> little grandson goes to after school care in another state. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6701.603s">And</a> when I worried about availability and asked my daughter, are you going to get in? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6706.966s">Is</a> he going to get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6708.046s">She</a> said, Mom, every parent is guaranteed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6710.828s">to</a> have after-school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6712.529s">And</a> that's where we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6714.29s">It</a> shouldn't be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6715.751s">It</a> should be every parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6717.171s">And</a> at the same time, we need our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6719.993s">And,</a> you know, my experience and my past with some after-school is it can be pretty tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6725.515s">And</a> I was impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6726.596s">Like</a> my colleague Kathy, I went to go visit the after-school program, and I was amazed at how calmly and efficiently and caringly it was run. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6737.381s">And</a> I was really proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6739.023s">to</a> see how wonderful our staff members were. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6742.554s">But</a> I'm concerned if they're stretched, if all of a sudden they have to cover <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6746.223s">two</a> classrooms if they have to cover more because someone's out sick or someone has left. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6751.807s">One</a> of the questions we have to raise is we don't need to want to be going every single year to start out at the beginning of the year being understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6761.976s">So</a> is there incentives that we can put in to keep people with us so that it's not just, you know, a short-term job but in fact something that people will commit themselves to? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6771.743s">You</a> know, you pay different money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6775.186s">At</a> the hospital, there are certain jobs where when you're on the more difficult shifts, you get more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6782.191s">If</a> you're not getting benefits for a shift for a job like this, then I think you need to factor that in into the hourly pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6791.397s">And</a> I think the time has come that we really need to look at the finances to understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6796.161s">So</a> I think I appreciate your report very much, Megan. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6799.083s">I</a> think this is step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6800.604s">I'm</a> asking for step two.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8432.643s">Yes,</a> like my colleague, I've thought about this, and what he just said was sort of on key, that these, this plan is really for the purposes of evaluating the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8444.048s">But</a> I think many of the school committee members, and I know that as we just went through this election, many of us said, we need a strategic plan for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8452.852s">And</a> that wasn't limited to, I mean, this is very focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8457.814s">I</a> believe that we need to take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8460.417s">the</a> district and set a strategic plan, and maybe we should call it the school committee strategic plan as opposed to the superintendent's strategic plan, to take a look at all the factors and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8470.419s">where</a> do we want to be in three years, in five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8475.183s">What</a> is our projection? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8476.824s">And</a> that's a different type of strategic plan than this evaluation piece, which is obviously moving us forward and specifically geared to <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8492.915s">mathematics</a> instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8494.316s">So</a> I'm sure that with my colleagues we'll be doing that and we should be talking about what type of meetings we want to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8503.698s">I</a> don't think that those kind of discussions work within a regular school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8508.8s">I</a> think it would be more important to take a look at a different venue and to really lay out some time and see what the vision is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8518.703s">So</a> I'll certainly, and I know that many other of my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8522.164s">we're</a> thinking that way as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8748.602s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8750.223s">So</a> I wanted to, we had a legal matter today. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8756.807s">And</a> I thought that we would be going into an executive session, but.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8765.733s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8768.654s">No.</a> <h2><a href="../2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M/2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 21, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.368s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.908s">I</a> noticed that quite a number of people have been brought on after the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1443.271s">So,</a> for example, let's just use the paraprofessionals that have been brought on, say, in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1448.774s">There's</a> one October 8th, one October 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1451.355s">The</a> second one, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1453.738s">So</a> at the beginning of the school, we have many new employee induction programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1462.157s">people</a> are hired and have a later arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1466.121s">How</a> are we making sure that they are up to date on all of the information they need to or would have gotten had they been hired in an earlier time?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1506.509s">Do</a> we have some sort of check-off list to make sure, for example, that everybody is aware of our emergency plans?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1521.929s">Okay,</a> I think we need to follow that through at some point, so thank you for that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1527.291s">The</a> second question is, I noticed cheerfully that we have hired quite a few people in the after-school program, and I would like to ask for a update on the after-school program at a meeting in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1550.016s">Thirdly,</a> one last, I understand we have a teacher out, a science teacher out and at, oh I think it's the Andrews 8th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1561.809s">and</a> parents were concerned about who was going to replace the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1568.153s">And</a> Dr. Maurice, you and I corresponded about this, saying that right now it was a certified teacher, but not certified in science. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1579.16s">So</a> the question is, is are we seeking a certified <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1582.522s">science</a> teacher to replace that, because I think that there is concern, especially given that the students had a teacher, the same group of students had a teacher out last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1593.385s">So</a> that's two years in a row that they would be having a non, or I don't know who took the place last year, but I do know right now that we have a person in there who may be terrific, I don't know, but is not certified in science.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.173s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.433s">Could</a> you provide us with an update on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1657.014s">And</a> also again, because of the concern, I would like to ask that, you know, the <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1663.928s">the</a> new teacher be monitored carefully just to make sure that he or she is doing whatever they're supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1673.35s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5484.488s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5485.609s">I</a> think, just as a comment, I think that my initial reading of this was I was almost a little disappointed, and people have touched on this, that we weren't doing the DIBLS 8 at one of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5497.176s">Because</a> just from a kind of common sense place of where we're sitting is, oh, that means that we're testing different assessment tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5508.911s">and</a> getting an idea of how they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5510.612s">However,</a> I did read carefully your sentence that you put in here about saying that you guys have truly looked at both of them and saw them to be comparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5521.579s">So,</a> but that's, you know, it's kind of almost a common sense that my initial reaction was saying, oh wait, they're not doing DIBLS-8? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5528.363s">Well,</a> I thought we should be because we should be looking at all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5531.785s">The</a> next thing is we were passing around the colored <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5535.948s">places,</a> pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5537.369s">Okay,</a> so I wanted to know what you do for a child who's colorblind. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5541.833s">Do</a> you first assess whether they're colorblind?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5552.148s">Okay,</a> and with those, the students, the idea is how fast the students can read those?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5580.736s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5581.416s">And</a> a student who's coming in who has been speaking a different language?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5607.34s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.021s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.581s">And</a> my last comment really is, and this really comes from speaking to my own daughter recently, recently, and the whole question of dyslexic, and she is dyslexic and was not identified until really till older in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5626.831s">But</a> she said to me, well, mom, of course we should have known because I was always in the low reading group. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5631.953s">and</a> made clear the pain of being stigmatized in the low reading group. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5639.38s">And</a> here we're talking a lot about taking students and determining what they know can do and not, but it also opens up and raises the concern of saying that those kids then are grouped together as the poor readers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5653.913s">And</a> I just, I don't know how we're doing that today, but Nicole.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5738.076s">Just</a> one last, because you brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5739.937s">So</a> one of the interesting things about my daughter, she can read on a computer screen much, much easier than she can read on a page. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5746.322s">So</a> how do we differentiate when we're giving a computer test for those kids for her who might struggle with the written page?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6700.078s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6701.759s">The</a> increase, say, between the last year and this new year one, do you know what that is approximately? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6709.104s">It's</a> roughly 4%.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6724.717s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6725.638s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7062.21s">To</a> my colleague, it would make more sense for you to make the motion that prior to the next implementation or prior to the next time contract that we do a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7075.957s">Because</a> to do it in December, well now, then another two and three quarter years are going to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7082.601s">So</a> the information will be current, but if you make the motion that prior to the next time we go out to renew the contract, we do that cost analysis between in-house and out-house or outside, that would make much more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7098.355s">So</a> if I could ask you to reword it.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1566.818s">So</a> I did attend the meeting because I was the one who had sent it from the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1572.101s">And</a> originally, we had sent it to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1574.823s">And</a> then on request, we sent it to <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1577.528s">the</a> Policy Subcommittee, but I'm not a member, so I wanted to attend, so I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1582.732s">The</a> other thing that I think was clear from the meeting was that many of the policies that we have posted on the website <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1592.118s">as</a> Benford Public Schools need to be reviewed and updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1595.38s">That</a> at this time that they were over time, since we originally did it and we worked very, very hard to have it done originally, but it was not updated periodically as we changed policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1609.611s">So</a> I don't know exactly when we're gonna get to that, but I believe that it's probably your committee, Kathy, that wants to do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1681.841s">We</a> have been meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1682.901s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1684.322s">I</a> know how time consuming it is, because I was part of the original putting them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1688.504s">However,</a> as they're updated, they should be brought to the school committee for their review. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1692.965s">We</a> have been.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1710.251s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1710.831s">Yeah,</a> exactly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1715.817s">I</a> didn't understand that your plan was to review every policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1719.521s">And</a> that's what I'm suggesting that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1721.143s">So</a> clearly, we're on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1722.665s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1723.146s">Yes,</a> but one at a time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2410.841s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2411.081s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2411.521s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2413.932s">I,</a> too, just wanted to add my thanks to both of you, and I particularly appreciated, as I read the part about sort of revamping the DARE education to now fit within the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2427.815s">That</a> includes vaping education as well, and I think that's something that we're all concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2434.976s">So</a> I was really glad to see that that was articulated in here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2439.037s">And</a> I think it's a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2440.798s">I</a> think that I used to run lunch bunches, and I know how valuable they can be for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2447.542s">It's</a> a little bit relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2448.683s">They</a> look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2450.544s">And</a> having a police officer as a friendly face in the room, I think, is a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2455.207s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2805.702s">Superintendent,</a> I was wondering if you could let the school committee know when the next PFLAG presentation will happen at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2813.344s">So</a> would it be possible for us to attend? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2815.944s">Is</a> that something that would be OK?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2819.285s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2827.206s">And</a> it would be OK if we attended?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2830.447s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3652.33s">I</a> just wanted to thank you, too, for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3655.792s">I</a> was curious a little bit just about the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3660.44s">So</a> it sounds like we need more parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3663.341s">Is</a> that because more students are driving to school?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.948s">As</a> I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=659.248s">to</a> know him. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=660.049s">And</a> it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=661.349s">It's</a> nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=662.39s">We're</a> so excited over the years watching you grow and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=666.392s">And</a> thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=672.596s">It's</a> been so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=674.097s">And,</a> you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=683.943s">And</a> it's just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=685.404s">So</a> thank you so much, Joseph.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1660.809s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1661.729s">So</a> I thought about this a lot, and because I was disappointed that students who really would have liked to have gone to the March <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1672.054s">didn't</a> go because they would have adversely affected their team because they're not allowed to take part in those activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1682.942s">But</a> to me, while there was a question of timing, it happened quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1688.787s">We</a> only knew about it, or I only knew about it the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1692.75s">To</a> me, this is a school committee policy question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1696.485s">And</a> to me, I feel like the administrative people probably are doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1702.112s">And</a> now I have to step in and say, this is a policy question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1705.816s">I</a> think we need to look at the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1707.771s">I</a> don't think that students should be penalized for attending a climate change march. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1713.696s">I'd</a> love it to be an educational opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1716.758s">I</a> would even consider some sort of, I mean, I agree with Paul that that distinction between excused and unexcused, perhaps we need to talk about that overall because I've had parents come to me <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1730.689s">with</a> frustration about that policy in the bigger sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1736.093s">Because</a> they say, you know, my kid was sick, but not so sick that they needed to go to the doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1741.496s">So</a> I just put aside over to the left and say, we have a bigger question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1747.3s">But</a> I do believe it's a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1750.222s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that the school committee meet to discuss the absentee policy, especially in regards to outside events. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1760.567s">that</a> students would like to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1762.829s">I</a> think that if we can sit down around the table and come to a better way to handle this, that this would be better for our students, and then we wouldn't be putting our administrators, you know, holding them up with annoyance. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1779.704s">So,</a> if I could.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2557.346s">I</a> just want to be clear that by asking to send this to the policy committee, it's not because in any way that I agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2564.231s">I</a> didn't agree with the choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2566.413s">It's</a> just because I'm taking the power that we have as school committee members, and that is to make and set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2573.538s">And</a> I think that's the way that we can go about it and craft what we <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2578.582s">will</a> agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2580.043s">I</a> also just want to mention in all of this, the one thing that I kept on thinking about was that lovely young lady that came to us last spring, wanting to bring to our attention her frustration with the styrofoam trays. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2593.99s">And</a> I think now it's September, and I know we're working on it, but yet it doesn't feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2605.512s">we're</a> really concerned enough, because if we're concerned enough, then price wouldn't be a matter, and we would get reusable trays. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2612.257s">I</a> was at Tufts yesterday, at the Tufts Community Day, and I noticed all the plates were, they're recycled paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2619.622s">And</a> so I'm concerned that our own body isn't feeling the pressure enough, that we're gonna get to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2631.957s">but</a> we're not getting to it fast enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2634.018s">And</a> I think that it's up to us when we have a student like this, and we all agreed, we all agreed what we should do, that we should make it happen, not wait until it happens.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2699.328s">It</a> may be trickier than you think because the excused and unexcused, I mean, I'm not sure that matters as much as, and I don't think we can go back and unfortunately change the fact that the real issue was they couldn't participate in their extracurriculars if they went. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2726.977s">And</a> that's what is at the real meat of this, is that that's what the problem was. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2735.265s">I'm</a> not certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2739.652s">So</a> just as I try to think about this and I may need some help from the administration here of saying we could ask students if they went to the climate change on Friday, I guess that's how we would identify who went as opposed to who was sick or who was whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2757.92s">I'm</a> not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2759.301s">I</a> think we kind of need to look at our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2761.122s">I'm</a> not against it, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2763.363s">I'm</a> just not quite sure how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2766.417s">We</a> could, it doesn't have to be decided tonight, we could go to that policy, the policy subcommittee and we could discuss it there and it could be retroactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2776.799s">Would</a> that be okay?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3778.243s">Well,</a> I commend Kathy for volunteering to be the chair, and she may very well end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3783.188s">In</a> previous times when we did, I was on both the Building the Future 1 and Building the Future 2, and part of the much larger community group that was on it, the mayor appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3794.078s">And</a> that is typical, in my experience on the school committee, is that the mayor appoints who's going to be on a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3800.744s">Just</a> as we did with the superintendent search, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3803.827s">We</a> asked the community who was interested in it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4276.546s">I</a> just wanted to mention that I was up at Tufts and I saw Diane Caldwell giving out these bookmarks that had been made by our Graphic Arts Department, a nice little PR piece, and I wanted to express my appreciation to Diane for sitting in the sun, as well as I believe Lisa was there earlier, Lisa Evangelista, and also to the CCSR students who were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4300.234s">It</a> was a hot day, but very, very nice.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6997.687s">And</a> I just wanted to ask you about the grade implementation, because on one it says K to 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7004.31s">Are</a> we doing K to 2 students in all the schools?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7013.675s">And</a> when we, is this a one-on-one?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7066.255s">I</a> think at some point, if it's possible, once they get a little bit of practice, I think it would be great if school committee members who are available could go and watch an implementation, see what a child is doing.<h2><a href="../2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU/2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 9, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3224.302s">A</a> parent approached me with concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3240.82s">She</a> wondered what the kids were receiving to eat, because her child had come home and reported something that was concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3248.763s">She</a> thought perhaps two should agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3251.203s">And</a> so we just wanted to be clear on what the breakfast program is providing to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3257.625s">I'll</a> absolutely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3258.966s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3272.798s">It's</a> a year.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4569.581s">Do</a> we have an understanding of when that would be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4573.378s">No,</a> the CPC process.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4587.037s">So</a> no possible, we're not moving forward on any of the playgrounds till next spring, even though they were in year two of our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4596.821s">Do</a> we, you know, I guess part of me thought that we're just going out to bond for money come into this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4619.934s">I</a> was at the Columbus School for the Welcome to Kindergarten students, and though I've been there many times looking at the playground surface, I was truly taken aback at how bad it had gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4635.519s">So</a> I was thinking that we were going to be able to be moving on these much sooner than now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4641.563s">Money</a> coming up in the spring, and we all know what that means, is the projects aren't really going to happen maybe until next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4648.808s">And</a> frankly, I just think it's, I mean, at some point there's a question of what is the safety level of our <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4655.251s">playgrounds.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4656.932s">It's</a> been a good number of years that they're there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4659.634s">They're</a> not meant to last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4661.635s">They</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4663.035s">And</a> so quite honestly, I'm really disappointed that we're not moving more aggressively on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4667.798s">And</a> I understand that there's these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4670.224s">But</a> I guess part of me feels like, well, we ought to have a plan B. We ought to be thinking of a plan B now in case we don't get funded for all of those plan grants.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4699.91s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.21s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.53s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5378.226s">I</a> just want to follow up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5379.447s">Thank</a> you for all your work, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5380.768s">One</a> of the things that I noted in particular with the compressors, that was a big ticket item and I see a lot of them got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5386.653s">So</a> that is just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5388.194s">The</a> other thing which I noticed on this list is how much of this, you know, it's stuff that people can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5396.283s">It</a> needs to be done, but it's not visible stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5398.644s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5399.284s">It's</a> not paint and wax. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5400.425s">And</a> that's just, I'm making a point because it's important to realize that this is thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, all of which needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5407.768s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5408.088s">But</a> you can't really even see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5409.469s">So</a> it's the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5410.689s">So</a> thanks again.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5585.991s">But</a> you never let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5586.811s">But</a> if they had come to you, it was just a great concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.633s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.953s">You're</a> welcome.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3857.629s">So,</a> I would think that it seems to me that there is a leap of faith here, to some extent, by going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3866.679s">Because</a> we have the statistics between two of our schools, and someone answered about a bus being late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3874.668s">Well,</a> I'm sure hoping that the principal who's meeting that bus that is late is the caring individual who we know that they are and who will usher that it's not a, you know, all of a sudden breakfast is going to close and the door is closed and there's no chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3891.176s">When</a> I was a guidance Councilor over in Everett, there was a child who consistently came late to school and we knew had no food. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3901.101s">And</a> I want to tell you, we always managed to get that child food by going down to the kitchen, by getting help, and we had no breakfast program at that time set up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3910.326s">But</a> there are caring individuals in our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3913.127s">I</a> am sure that there are other people in our buildings who want to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3917.549s">And</a> I'm betting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3919.15s">So</a> I'm going to bet on that and vote for approval of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3923.332s">And</a> then see, we might have kinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3926.013s">We</a> might have to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3927.454s">We</a> might have to revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3928.995s">But</a> I'm at least willing to try it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3930.676s">So</a> that's where I'll come down tonight.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8326.081s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8326.481s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8327.943s">So</a> first I want to thank the parents for being here this evening, and I also want to thank them for all the work and time they've invested into their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8339.032s">Overall,</a> I edited up, it was $143,000 worth of different activities, events, books, Chromebooks, things that were funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8351.343s">by</a> the PTOs or PTJ for their students and their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8356.288s">So</a> it's truly fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8358.39s">I'm</a> going to mention the transportation issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8363.634s">The</a> field trips are part of our negotiations with the bus company, which happens every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8372.402s">And</a> it is disheartening because that number always just goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8376.066s">It's</a> one of the reasons why <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8377.786s">In</a> some cases, it's better if an outside resource can come into your school rather than you busing the kids out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8385.409s">But</a> we all know, of course, that it's really great to give kids different perspectives and bus them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8391.272s">So</a> that one, we'll look again when we talk about our transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8396.834s">Again,</a> I think we've got one more year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8399.135s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8400.035s">Yeah,</a> we have one more year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8401.116s">So</a> that contract will come up in the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8405.305s">If</a> you do have a problem, and I trust that anybody who did would immediately report it, because I'm disheartened to hear about the issue like with Smolluck Farms, but that should immediately be brought to the attention of Christine Patterson, who will then follow it up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8423.954s">So</a> again, thank you so much for all of your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8427.475s">I</a> do see some equity issues that were raised, and I think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8431.291s">talk</a> about them a little bit more in terms of the number of Chromebooks that the district has supplied versus the PTO has bought. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8441.439s">Because</a> in some ways that seems like, gee, I think that's a district responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8446.842s">There</a> is one thing I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled that the elementary schools are working together and that you've formed this alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8454.846s">However,</a> as the former head of the Medford Home and School Association, which lasted four years, and I'm a little concerned about the exclusivity only to elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8471.209s">years</a> go on quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8474.07s">And</a> I fear that by just containing it to just the elementary schools, that you're really writing off some of the most involved parents that have been part of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8484.033s">And</a> you might not think about it right now because maybe your child's only in third grade, but before you know it, they're going to be in sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8491.835s">Why</a> would you <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8494.396s">seek</a> to exclude those parents who are very active or who might be very active or who have been very active. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8502.705s">Rather</a> than limit it, I would prefer to see it grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8507.551s">And</a> I realize that for the different projects there might be different ways that maybe it's not equitable for the middle schools <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8515.385s">if</a> they're part of it to receive as high an amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8519.009s">But</a> maybe on some other projects, they would be equal partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8522.092s">I</a> really think you need to give that some consideration and take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8526.898s">I</a> know it's probably a lengthy discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8528.68s">We</a> can't do it all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8530.081s">But</a> I'm throwing out my two cents and saying, please don't limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8533.485s">Please</a> increase, become more inclusive, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8536.408s">not</a> less. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8537.268s">It's</a> a wonderful, wonderful resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8539.589s">You</a> have people talking to each other, which is just so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8543.529s">You</a> know, schools finding out which things worked at your school, which doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8547.53s">And</a> again, the combined resources, that Disney project alone, what a great, great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8552.971s">So</a> those are my two cents, and I hope to talk to you more about that at some other time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9546.357s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9546.537s">Congratulations,</a> Joan. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9548.368s">We're</a> very, very happy to have you move into the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9551.23s">We're</a> sad to lose Kathy, but we're delighted to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9555.412s">Do</a> you want to say a few words? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9556.273s">I</a> just want to say thank you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10429.516s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10429.697s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10431.797s">So,</a> do students who would normally pay for their <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10436.935s">breakfast</a> or lunch, would they be paying for their breakfast and lunch?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10451.058s">So</a> how do we pay for that breakfast?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10455.859s">And</a> will the federal reimbursements cover all of our costs?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10473.104s">So</a> what's the downside?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10492.23s">So</a> I think that it would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10494.451s">I</a> mean, obviously, this sounds like it's great, but I think that it makes sense for you to sit down with our administrative people, one of whom, Christine, is standing behind you, unless you want to give us a recommendation right now or... <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10509.414s">We</a> said it would be short, that's my only concern here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10517.737s">It</a> sounds great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11230.547s">So</a> I'm sort of caught here because I think that it's so clear, the message that this committee is sending is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11240.736s">The</a> members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students free <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11247.635s">to</a> adopting provision 2, so to enable our students, the possibility of, all of our students, the possibility of free breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11258.243s">I'm</a> reluctant to vote on it without having a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11264.808s">I</a> think that's a courtesy to our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11267.467s">I</a> hear from Sarah that they wanted to report to us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11273.41s">I</a> think that we could make the resolution, if my colleague was willing to withdraw his, to say that the members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students with nutritious breakfast options. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11288.678s">And</a> to that end, they want to support <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11294.01s">uh,</a> project, uh, sorry, provision two, uh, breakfast model, um, uh, that we, and further that we are asking, uh, for a, a follow-up from administration at the meeting of June 17th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11321.611s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11322.231s">I</a> said June 17th, that meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12266.112s">What</a> is the incentive for students to participate?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12367.581s">confirmed</a> to be abstinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12369.162s">I</a> read it by urine test.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12376.33s">Okay,</a> so month one, abstinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12379.153s">Month</a> two, abstinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12380.874s">Month</a> three, failed the urine test. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12383.898s">What</a> happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12385.679s">No</a> payment?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12399.127s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12399.807s">So</a> the incentive for a child... So what if a child has used marijuana once? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12406.777s">So</a> it was a one-time thing?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12429.606s">It</a> sounds like there's a fair amount of interaction with the students who participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12437.377s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12437.657s">So</a> when are they doing that interaction?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12488.451s">For</a> the purposes of this study, can we say, yes, we're interested in having our students participate, but we want to limit it to 9th to 12th grade? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12498.732s">so</a> we don't necessarily have to include the younger kids?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12502.854s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12525.61s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12525.831s">I'm</a> just wondering in terms of, say, rolling it out, whether you might start at one age group and then, you know, say, this is how it worked or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12536.799s">Can</a> I just ask for this evening, what is... I don't think we're at the point of final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12548.795s">It</a> seems like there's a lot of details that need to be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12554.296s">So,</a> Superintendent, could you give us an idea what you would suggest would be the way to move forward?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14226.868s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14227.869s">So</a> the first question is in terms of the two-day PD, are there two days in June scheduled for PD that are available, and this would be all middle school math teachers?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14251.267s">Okay,</a> what will the other teachers be doing for PD during that time?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14281.963s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14282.383s">So,</a> boy, I mean, that's just a lot of organization that needs to be done very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14286.324s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14287.004s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14287.164s">Now,</a> I recall when we discussed this, one of the things that I had thought as I was concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14294.242s">with</a> the issues is that we should buy some sets of classroom editions. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14301.826s">And</a> I see the cost for books, one classroom set of student edition per teacher, and one teacher edition is $12,962. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14309.049s">And</a> that would be multiplied by what?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14410.368s">So</a> just to continue, the student editions are paperback, is that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15150.386s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15152.287s">I</a> did not receive your letter, probably because you sent it to the school, and it never forwards to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15157.992s">Pvanderkloot</a> at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15160.033s">Works</a> every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15161.574s">So</a> look, if we do the extensive PD, and we talked about the need for PD, it's $15,350. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15171.18s">12,962</a> buys us one set. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15172.881s">Now,</a> it seems to me that there's huge arguments in favor of doing a comprehensive middle school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15180.603s">We</a> hear Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15182.723s">Irving's</a> concerns and we respect her very much from years, if not decades, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15191.883s">working</a> together. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15194.364s">Oh,</a> okay, I didn't even read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15196.245s">So</a> the question is, one of the things that we haven't really quite understood overall is where we are in the comprehensive budget final number, because ultimately this comes down to a budget number. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15210.292s">So</a> one set of books and a teacher's edition comes to $12,962, but we're saying maybe we want more than <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15221.398s">a</a> teacher to have more than one set. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15224.12s">So</a> let's say we were willing to, if we had the money and we wanted to put, we're saying, look, this is so important, we're going to spend $75,000 on it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15233.267s">How</a> many books does that get us? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15235.329s">Do</a> we have that money in our, is that possible for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15240.373s">What</a> is the limit? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15241.214s">Because</a> I don't think we've answered that question yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15243.676s">I</a> don't know in our budget where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15249.812s">it</a> becomes very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15251.132s">I</a> personally believe that we should go forward, okay, but we should go forward with the maximum amount of professional development, that we should go forward with the maximum amount of resources for students that we can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15265.219s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15266.899s">And,</a> you know, that we don't want to set people up for failure.<h2><a href="../2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g/2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 6, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=756.26s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to suspend the usual order of business so we can take up item number four, recognition of student achievements, humanities awards, today.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2391.148s">I</a> would also like to thank the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2392.75s">I</a> want to tell you that I wish that many years ago when my youngest, I didn't realize, we didn't know until much later that she was dyslexic, and it's actually impacted her whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2405.7s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2407.065s">I</a> think it would make sense for us to again suspend the order of business and go directly to the reports on dyslexia since we've now gotten into the topic.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4196.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.703s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.983s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.564s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.825s">I</a> just was curious whether there is any indication that for preschoolers, I mean, is this something that can be seen even earlier for a parent? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4213.156s">Are</a> there particular sort of warning signs?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4241.963s">The</a> other question is the parent who came before us noted that her student had in fact been given some remediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4248.846s">How</a> do we figure out what's the best way to help a student? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4255.608s">We'll</a> go with the model that the student has been screened early. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4258.929s">What</a> is the approach that we're going to best meet the needs of a student who falls into that category?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4346.288s">Who</a> do you think is doing a particularly good job, if we think about <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4351.034s">districts</a> you've worked with?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4395.239s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7026.215s">First,</a> I also would like to give a shout out to Nicole Chin. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7030.7s">Nicole</a> was the CCSR student who really organized that dinner on Friday night, and she and her devoted parents did such a wonderful job pulling that event together, and I think everybody had a great time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7044.42s">And</a> it was great to celebrate the students as well as to see those senior students who received $500 scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7053.086s">So</a> it was a great, great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7055.007s">I'd</a> like to go back to the beginning where you talked about the middle school lottery, Superintendent, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7062.071s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7063.402s">So</a> I sort of have two different sort of series of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7067.164s">I</a> think it's important to look back at the process and say what worked well, what didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7073.529s">And</a> so in reflecting on that, I was curious how much the outside CPA firm cost and whether it was worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7082.094s">And</a> if we were to do it again, whether we would need an outside firm?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.09s">Was</a> it worth it? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.691s">If</a> we did it again, would we need it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7137.231s">And</a> I absolutely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7138.891s">I</a> just wanted to know, and it was important to create a baseline of making sure that it was transparent and clear and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7146.532s">But</a> of course, having said that, I'm sure others have received, too, discussion from parents still asking, is there another way? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7154.974s">And</a> I think that it's important now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7156.534s">I</a> know that in the time that you came in, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7161.855s">and</a> did a quick evaluation and say, this year this is the best way to do it, that we didn't really afford the timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7170.837s">But</a> I think it's important now to take a step back and to say, is there another way? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7176.978s">Does</a> it make sense for all the 6th graders to be in one place and divide up the 7th or 8th grade class so that they all know each other?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7311.705s">I</a> always feel the urge, though, as we discuss this, and I very much would like to see that feasibility study, and that's the reason why I'm bringing it up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7319.431s">And</a> it doesn't sound like I need to make a motion because it seems like it's clearly part <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7324.255s">your</a> direction, but of course I want the school committee member to be very much involved with the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7329.34s">But</a> I do, I always think that just from a historical perspective, it's very important that the community realize that the reason why we built the two schools in the way that we did was that because it enabled us to get 90% funding from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7345.414s">And</a> so the cost of our buildings, these magnificent buildings, was a very small cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7352.221s">And</a> as I always have listened to other districts and heard when someone came and talked to me today about what's going on in their district, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7358.68s">And</a> I said, well, how much is the state going to be able to contribute? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7363.464s">And</a> it was opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7365.325s">It</a> was like 10%, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7367.007s">And</a> that is why we ended up with the K to 8 in one building in the middle school, 6th, 7th, and 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7376.114s">But</a> now many years have passed, and it's time to take a look at it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7414.717s">It</a> was a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7415.618s">But</a> did you get up and dance?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7446.616s">Motion</a> to accept.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7448.017s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7449.078s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7450.539s">Call</a> it, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.181s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.501s">All</a> in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7453.809s">No,</a> you have to do it, it's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7454.91s">Oh,</a> okay, okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7466.217s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8298.522s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.069s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.689s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.33s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.65s">Vendicott.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8397.051s">So,</a> I feel like I'm a little confused because I think we're mixing a lot of different things in that there's different issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8405.079s">Paul,</a> you're raising the question of the calendar scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8410.824s">I</a> think that the tie-in was where is the money going? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8415.789s">But</a> we have received <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8418.079s">reports</a> from Christine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8419.64s">We</a> did look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8420.941s">It</a> was somewhere, I don't remember, back at some point or another, maybe it was a year ago, where we looked at it and we saw, and at that time no one had any questions about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8430.107s">It</a> was all detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8432.388s">So</a> maybe, you know, again, we should look at what date we did that and we should do it again on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8438.432s">And</a> in fact, I think that the motion at the time was that we would be doing it at a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8444.088s">So</a> that's sort of in one pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8447.251s">The</a> report that we got today was on student activity accounts, which is different, but maybe we want them side to side with the friends of, so that we can say, gee, it's interesting, girls basketball, and I'm just picking one up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8463.476s">out</a> of the blue with, you know, has both a student activity account and it has this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8470.218s">It</a> also is a friends of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8472.339s">It's</a> because I think that's, Erin, what you're talking about is sort of saying, gee, there are some things that aren't listed here, which I thought they would come up with a student activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8481.121s">No,</a> a student activity account is different than what we talked about earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8486.102s">So</a> I just, I need to make some lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8488.523s">I</a> think we, you know, when you throw it all into the same <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8492.3s">motion,</a> it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8496.104s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8497.445s">So,</a> having said that, it's... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8506.913s">Can</a> I think about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8508.234s">I</a> don't want to do it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8510.176s">So</a> let's...
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8644.188s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8648.277s">To</a> my colleague, I think it would make sense if we reviewed that in October as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8653.46s">I</a> don't think we need to make a motion right at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8656.101s">That</a> would be my suggestion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8711.838s">Resolutions?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8713.359s">Oh,</a> excuse me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8827.155s">Motion</a> to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8828.931s">To</a> executive session? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.532s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.812s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.932s">Do</a> we have to vote for that, correct?<h2><a href="../2019-04-22_LRgDo3q--Pg/2019-04-22_LRgDo3q--Pg.html">Medford School Committee April 8, 2019 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=793.536s">So</a> we have a couple of different talks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=795.816s">The</a> one I mentioned, we did receive, or we're going to receive, a little while before about <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=803.367s">that</a> should be included in this capital plan because it was a piece of information we didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=810.289s">I</a> think we can probably go ahead with the approval of the work of the committee of the whole now, but perhaps, you know, I'm still thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=819.632s">Can</a> we add that to the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=821.112s">If</a> I end a meeting, you could... I think that while it was important to <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=828.026s">Though,</a> we are far from done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=831.487s">My</a> colleague Mr. Ruggiero asked for, and I don't see it noted here, but there was also an ask for a report on things like how many compressors we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=843.57s">water</a> heaters, just so that we had a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=846.292s">And</a> when we started out, and it was four years ago, or three and a half in November, we really had gone through the schools and put together a comprehensive list, which I understand that Christine had told us that we are, you know, we've been hitting items on that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=861.641s">But</a> at the very end of the meeting, we talked about, we had a conversation that wandered into saying, you know, there's still a lot of people in our community who have grave concerns about the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=873.307s">There's</a> this question about what's functional and what's aesthetically pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=880.231s">Many</a> of us have long been concerned, just like City Hall down in Boston has the same type of architecture that our high school does. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=889.496s">Is</a> there anything that we can do? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=891.477s">We've</a> actually never looked into <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=896.681s">Is</a> there a paint that works? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=898.803s">I</a> did comment that there is a building over in Arlington that used to look very much like our high school did. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=906.528s">It's</a> the DSS building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=909.069s">And</a> they've made it look from externally, I'm talking externally, much, much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=917.154s">Again,</a> the external factors for me, landscaping and making it look nicer that way, <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=922.914s">I</a> think we actually need to do more exploration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=925.818s">We</a> had some discussions, some thoughts went out at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=931.905s">I</a> know that there's concern about having another subcommittee, because my initial desire would be saying, I think we need <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=941.436s">a</a> working subcommittee of really members who are willing to do a little bit of, during, and I would suggest that we do it during the summer, doing some more research into some of these other questions around the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=957.661s">I'm</a> not putting together a motion right now because I want to talk to members to say, how should we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=962.963s">How</a> do we go forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=964.363s">But</a> we have to discuss these issues more thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=967.604s">and</a> take a look at those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=969.608s">I</a> walked through the high school again, and you know, my biggest, you think about what is functional. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=977.572s">But</a> I'm thinking about being functional as a school committee member and being what is my first impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=986.656s">And</a> you do get kind of blind to what someone's first impression would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=992.858s">And</a> there's certainly issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=995.099s">So</a> I'm just going to put it on the table now to say to my <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=999.141s">Colleagues,</a> I think we only just began in that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1005.264s">It's</a> not the first go-round. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1006.804s">I</a> can assure you of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1008.085s">Those</a> discussions have been had comprehensively across the city about creating lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1013.527s">But</a> it is time that we look again so that we feel when we're looking at more capital improvements in the future, we will be going back to information that we've gathered at this time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1282.459s">I've</a> had a discussion with the superintendent about the concerns about creating another subcommittee We have building and grounds so I think that that would probably be the place Place for us to to go to with this, but I think that if we could I don't know if we could look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1301.301s">You</a> know for me <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1302.425s">having,</a> because we don't have a lot of other events and meetings during the summer, the summer would be a good time to spend some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1308.186s">So</a> if there were, if there was the will, that's what I think we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1312.367s">So</a> I'm going to send the topic, if I make a motion to send the topic to Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, we'll do that.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3365.469s">I</a> would like to support this and make a motion to approve the change of language so that our language department would now be called world language. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3381.2s">that</a> this was the right thing to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3383.421s">And</a> I'm also very excited that you brought this forward to us and said, hey, we should do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3387.542s">This</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3389.042s">Again,</a> sometimes we're just thinking this way, and then someone else comes in new and goes, oh, yeah, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3394.504s">And</a> this was one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3395.624s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3396.664s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3733.052s">So</a> my concern is once we have an opinion like this, which clearly specifies, you know, the new four-inch power spring system is far superior <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3744.643s">upgrading</a> the spring floor system will be a night and day difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3748.806s">I'm</a> so reminded of the young woman I once met who was a high school gymnast and she was practically had suffered many injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3759.375s">So</a> when I, I'm very concerned about the potential for injuries here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3763.299s">And</a> I know we can say that forever, but we've now got the report here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3768.063s">So</a> I'd like to see this was not in our <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3771.289s">Thinking</a> when we did the capital plan, we just talked about a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3774.61s">We</a> talked about the potential of available money from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3779.051s">If</a> there were to be money, I think that we should either look for it to be in this current year, if there's any left over at the end of the year, once the books are settled, or be placed into year two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3793.575s">I'm</a> thinking, again, I'm no expert in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3797.876s">but</a> I'm always concerned about the potential of injuries, and clearly there is any number of students or groups of students who use this, and so I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3808.722s">So</a> my motion is to look to see whether we can place this in the capital plan for either year one, and if not year one, then year two.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3821.93s">To</a> include it in the capital plan, either year one, <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3825.757s">or</a> year two.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3829.2s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3829.58s">So</a> it could be replaced prior to the fall competition.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3837.385s">I'm</a> fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3990.995s">We</a> can put it into our regular budget.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5808.598s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5808.818s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5810.078s">First,</a> thank you, Dr. Maurice Vincent, for the comprehensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5816.14s">I</a> know how warmly the students have taken to you, and it's really great to see you with the students and with the staff out in the field, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5828.624s">There's</a> clearly so many different things in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5833.298s">One</a> of the things I did want to ask is that you mentioned that one of your key work underway is the launching of a district safety team to examine external reports and streamline safety policies, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5847.442s">I</a> would ask that the school committee, before the end of the school year, receive, and probably we need to do this because of sensitivity to security issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5860.294s">that</a> we would receive a more comprehensive report from this team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5866.776s">But</a> anyway, other than that, thank you very much for bringing us this report tonight, and I look forward to our future work together.<h2><a href="../2019-04-05_dWFoLPiqEXg/2019-04-05_dWFoLPiqEXg.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 1, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3509.479s">So,</a> you know, we've had other students come before us, and my personal feeling is that these students are bringing the pride of Medford with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3519.142s">So</a> I would like to see, again, if we could look towards a budget or perhaps, again, every so often the mayor's been able to come up with somebody who can cover the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3528.084s">I</a> really believe that we should be building in some costs, that this automatically, we now have participation <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3537.762s">in</a> DECA and it would seem that we should build in a budget line item to cover costs for this because we are <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3547.698s">optimistic</a> about the success of our students, whether it be in this or the ethics team, and even before we talked about Albert's success. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3556.782s">So</a> I would make that as a recommendation in general now, but as we talk about in our budget meetings, I'm going to come back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3565.446s">So</a> again, if we could look for funding, I'll put the request in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3569.708s">I</a> know that you are successful, have been successful doing some fundraising, and I think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3577.191s">We</a> certainly appreciate that, but I'd also like to see the rest of the cost covered if at all possible.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4661.859s">Right,</a> and certainly in terms of access from the outside in the bistro, it makes a lot of sense.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4471.878s">No,</a> I didn't have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4472.959s">I</a> just appreciate the information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6842.172s">Thank</a> you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6844.193s">On</a> page 5, one of the things I noticed, and you sort of did a side throwaway comment, was that, in fact, at the grade 4 level and grade 5, there really seems to be some struggle with fractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6859.32s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6859.62s">And</a> you said, and I noticed this as a high school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6863.122s">So</a> part of that is, and I do see some of your action items do include remedial help. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6870.0s">But,</a> you know, it seems like that this is something that we might need to work into some regular classrooms just to make sure that our students really are getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6879.002s">So</a> apart from the remedial MCAS sessions, is there possibility to bring this into the regular math classrooms?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6916.037s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6917.178s">The</a> follow-up then also was on page 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6921.881s">For</a> your future items, I see you wrote, adopt an inquiry-based mathematics program that will increase higher-level thinking for a more successful mathematics experience at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6932.028s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6932.648s">That</a> seems to be a very important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6934.71s">I'm</a> wondering whether you're thinking that adoption would take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6939.193s">We</a> haven't talked about it yet, so I'm not thinking you're suggesting this coming year, or are you?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7041.016s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7041.616s">And</a> is that something you're going to be bringing to us during budget time? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7047.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7048.22s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7048.541s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7049.061s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7050.142s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7051.282s">We</a> have yet to get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7052.823s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7053.464s">So</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7053.924s">But</a> we'll be on the lookout for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7055.185s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7055.325s">That's</a> why I want to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.245s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.706s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.846s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7057.266s">Lastly,</a> I just wanted to mention that this Saturday I was driving in my car and I was listening to NPR and there was a TED Talk on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7064.032s">And</a> the TED Talk was on teaching mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7066.553s">And</a> the particular part that I happened to be listening to was the importance of struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7070.896s">Well,</a> because I had the opportunity to go with the superintendent to do one of the walkthroughs in math, and that was one of the criteria that we looked at and that I saw and understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7083.302s">I</a> just thought that it was just a great thing then to be sitting and listening to the TED Talk about how we should be teaching math. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7091.206s">So</a> I just wanted to mention that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9261.617s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9262.158s">Van</a> de Kloop. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9264.039s">Rocco,</a> thank you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9265.84s">I</a> am a little bit concerned and I just hope that the requests that members have made are not going to tie you up for hours and hours and hours to generate additional data. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9276.589s">Is</a> that a problem?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9285.856s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9286.896s">So</a> sometimes I think that there's a problem wanting additional data, but also wanting to make sure that we're not tying up our professionals for doing the work that they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9297.745s">So</a> I'm a little concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9299.066s">But</a> mostly exciting in your report was the suggestion that there was a middle school program that would build on what we have just adopted with the Amplify Science. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9311.311s">So</a> I look forward to hearing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9313.292s">Is</a> that possibly? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9314.753s">Could</a> that be tried out next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9318.114s">Is</a> that what you were suggesting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9361.235s">So</a> would that happen by the beginning of next September?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9381.647s">I</a> just think it's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9382.668s">We</a> can build on the momentum we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9385.108s">And</a> so thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s/2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s.html">Medford School Committee meeting Wednesday, March 6, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5291.475s">Mr.</a> Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5294.297s">I</a> just wanted to see, and maybe I've missed it, but I see the mention of an improved cafeteria, but what about the library?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5361.741s">But</a> under number seven, the cafeteria is part?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5384.127s">I</a> guess I'm reflecting back a couple of years when we submitted but unfortunately were not chosen for renovation of the whole library area and that that's not a piece of either this or the funds we spoke about earlier this evening in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5402.327s">I</a> think that there were other <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5404.049s">Other</a> parts, I don't recall them off of hand, but they were very detailed at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5409.172s">And</a> so I was surprised not to see it as a piece of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5413.895s">And</a> I'd sort of like to look back at some of the plans at that time to see where we are, because not to even be considering it at this point would seem unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5426.783s">But</a> in terms of what is acceptable, then I would make a motion for approval.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6696.168s">I</a> mean, so for me, I've got to be pragmatic at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6699.429s">I</a> understand that there's been thinking that it might be easier if it were a smaller group. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6709.391s">At</a> the same time, I listen to my colleagues, and I know that if I wasn't on the subcommittee, I'd be arguing the way that they were, and that's a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6720.133s">You</a> know, part of me sort of says, hey, wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6722.976s">We've</a> got the first meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6724.116s">It's</a> very nicely organized here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6726.559s">The</a> first meeting is proposed for March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6730.122s">I</a> didn't hear other concerns about that particular date. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6735.126s">Why</a> don't we see how it goes as a committee of the whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6738.369s">Let's</a> try the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6739.97s">If</a> it seems unwieldy after that date, we'll reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6742.992s">But</a> I can't, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6746.335s">I</a> want to support you, but at the same time, I sort of feel like if I was not on the committee, I would be arguing just the way my colleagues who are opposed to it are.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6840.551s">So</a> I didn't, if I may Mayor Burke, I didn't understand why the first meeting March 14th, which is a week from tomorrow, was you said maybe it won't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6852.514s">Why</a> wouldn't it work date-wise?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6868.52s">If</a> I made a motion that we had a committee of the whole meeting next week to, on March 14th, to discuss the items listed, guidance, English language cards, social studies, that can't happen at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6884.717s">where</a> you're uncertain.<h2><a href="../2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ/2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ.html">Medford School Committee February 11, 2019 meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=788.069s">Mayor</a> Burke.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=883.659s">Judy,</a> you are such an inspiration to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=886.6s">And</a> you and all of your team, Rosemary, all the team, thank you so very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=892.904s">My</a> colleague said it perfectly, so I'll just add my thanks from the bottom of my heart.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1148.866s">I</a> just want to say that the members received your stories and we had a great time reading them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1154.911s">Especially</a> things that made me feel a little creepy was things like green-fleshed army and you have been dead for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1163.137s">So</a> a great job kids.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1331.34s">Nice</a> job, Arden. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1332.101s">I</a> love watching you play.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1672.306s">While</a> we're under suspension, I wish to bring information to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1678.888s">I</a> was approached by Kirsten Patterson to discuss the potential of doing in-depth <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1686.472s">budget</a> review this year in a slightly different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1689.18s">We've</a> normally had quick proposals that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1693.352s">presentations</a> that have come at the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1696.693s">She</a> suggested that we might do better to send it to a subcommittee to go for a very thorough, transparent look at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1706.535s">I</a> just wanted to ask Christine if she could come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1709.216s">She</a> suggested that it would come to the, that we would set up the meetings through the personnel subcommittee since 80% or so of the budget is personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1720.239s">I'm</a> the head of personnel, so I just want to make it clear that for me it would be always important that every member realizes that this would be a meeting that they are welcome and encouraged to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1732.41s">We</a> debated back and forth what we do with the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1735.633s">That</a> puts an obligation on the whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1737.794s">It's</a> difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1738.354s">There</a> will be expected to be quite a number of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1742.336s">And</a> what's really important is that we always have a certain number of members present to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1749.038s">So,</a> Christine, could you speak to the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1751.459s">Yes,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2730.668s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2730.868s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2732.189s">So</a> as the superintendent mentioned, I was talking to her and asked if I could attend when she mentioned this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2737.174s">And</a> I really felt that it was a wonderful opportunity to understand because I didn't, quite honestly, I really didn't understand what the superintendent was getting at when she was saying learning walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2750.676s">You</a> know, you spent 15 minutes in each class. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2752.337s">I'm</a> thinking, what are you going to find out in 15 minutes and whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2755.259s">So</a> it was really terrific to be able to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2757.66s">And</a> as I watched this video, I'm sure that I saw things because I was able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2765.704s">For</a> instance, watching a student and understanding that concept of productive struggle was really great to see happening in our classroom, to understand why we want to encourage our teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2780.092s">to</a> continue to have that grow in our classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2784.036s">And</a> again, if you have the opportunity in the next go-around, I highly would encourage my committee members to go and I'm quite thankful I was at the right place at the right time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4441.983s">Vandekloot,</a> you're all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4444.104s">First,</a> Superintendent, I really appreciate your fair and equitable approach to this dilemma that we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4455.167s">However,</a> I do believe that it certainly is going to still cause some consternation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4460.749s">One</a> specific question, just to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4464.03s">In</a> the past, the McGlynn Elementary students really had a, if they wanted to stay at the McGlynn, they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4472.257s">Now</a> it appears that this group of students, half of them would be going to the Andrew School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4479.101s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4562.89s">Now,</a> one of the questions we've had in the past had to do with the sibling preference, and I just want to be very clear as we roll this out that the sibling preference of people, and there was a past policy and discussion that happened, and it was around the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4581.617s">Parents</a> argued that they had been guaranteed sibling preference for the year after their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4587.822s">So</a> a child perhaps was going up to the high school and going into 9th grade, but another child was coming in at the 6th grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4596.549s">And</a> the reason behind it was that they had spent all that time contributing and building the school, and the parents had relationships which they wanted to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4608.639s">because</a> of their support of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4610.66s">I</a> just want to be clear that as we roll this out, that's one of the things that has arisen in the past that we need to be clear on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4673.861s">I</a> absolutely understand where you're going, but I just wanted to be clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4681.225s">Right,</a> right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4686.468s">And</a> in fact, there was a letter and the parents were able to substantiate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4691.352s">you</a> know, policy can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4692.633s">We</a> just need to be very clear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4695.115s">The</a> other thing I guess is I'm curious about how you're going to roll this out now after our, I would assume we'll vote on it, but after our approval, how will you sell this to the community?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4772.697s">I</a> think, I mean, I believe that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4775.059s">I</a> think that the other concern that will arise will be the friendship groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4782.284s">My</a> child's over here at this school and all the friends are going over to the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4787.828s">And</a> to that means, I think that it's really, really important <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4791.03s">that</a> we do a very concerted effort of understanding, especially now that it's very clear that we're going to have these new mixed groups of students, that we foster activities and create opportunities for kids to get to know new children, and we make that very much part of our goal as we enter this new phase.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5674.088s">So</a> earlier tonight, we in subcommittee talked about sort of the guiding principles of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5683.491s">And</a> what really we said was that we were here for all students and to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5689.137s">that</a> their educational opportunities were the best for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5693.218s">And</a> if I go back to that guiding principle and I look at what the superintendent just presented to us, I see that there may be some short-term pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5703.1s">The</a> long-term gain of making an equitable middle school environment is where we need to go for the benefit of all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5714.382s">I</a> appreciate that my colleague <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5717.628s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero might like some more time to digest it and to talk a little bit about rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5725.471s">On</a> the other hand, I am pulled because I would also like to affirm the policy and say that we should move forward and then have a subcommittee meeting to talk about what kind of presentations we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5740.836s">So</a> I would like to, and I'm just trying to figure out the right rules of order to do this,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5748.771s">His</a> would come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5750.612s">Can</a> I change yours?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6482.098s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6482.278s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6485.239s">To</a> my colleague, Mr. Rousseau, I think that there's some pragmatic questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6489.523s">We</a> started this year with a new superintendent, and she certainly needed some time to get on board and to learn the ropes and learn all the people and start with an instructional initiative with the math, which we saw earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6508.619s">If</a> there was clearly a simple answer other than this in terms of the size or whatever, I think she would have presented it tonight or suggested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6520.373s">The</a> in-depth that you speak of I think is probably worthwhile doing for the whole committee and community to really understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6529.223s">But</a> I think that there's a question that is before us in the immediate, and that is next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6537.266s">And</a> I don't think it's realistic to have had the superintendent come back and try and figure out all of those in-depth questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6544.168s">I</a> think that we need to set that as a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6549.21s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6549.95s">Mr.</a> Russo, point of information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6607.103s">I</a> agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6607.883s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out the timeline, the pragmatic point of all of this, is trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6615.087s">And</a> maybe we certainly want to, as we're doing this, we certainly want to be looking at that questions in terms of either our special education or our EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6625.533s">Is</a> there a way to better incorporate them into the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6630.696s">and</a> equal opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6634.598s">I</a> think that the question before us right at the moment is, I hear that there is a general feeling amongst members that this is the right thing to do, that the superintendent has come to us <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6649.873s">and</a> she's shown us numbers, numbers speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6653.715s">We've</a> talked about equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6655.096s">We've</a> talked about doing the right thing for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6657.378s">I</a> hear that we actually have some level of consensus in terms of what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6664.062s">What</a> I don't hear consensus on yet is whether we're going to approve the policy tonight and then have a subcommittee, or as the motion states, first have a subcommittee meeting and then approve the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6679.803s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6862.49s">So</a> next week is vacation week.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6902.292s">I</a> make a motion to approve the policy change and follow it up with the committee of the whole meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6933.951s">Yeah,</a> I'd like that to be a separate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6975.77s">I</a> make a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendation.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.008s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.508s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.588s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=644.429s">Erin,</a> I understand your concern and the importance of what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=648.69s">I</a> have some questions about how it should be worded correctly, because there's also an obligation by the physician as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=656.4s">So</a> to just put all the onus on how we write it has to include both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=663.327s">And</a> so I'm reluctant to all of a sudden just put a sentence in here and say we're going to approve it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=669.413s">I'm</a> hearing your concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=671.295s">I</a> understand there was an issue that I know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=674.698s">but</a> I'm asking that we would give us an opportunity, you know, we could perhaps do it at the beginning of our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=683.863s">We</a> could also have a subcommittee meeting, so we could bring it back next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=686.785s">Wouldn't</a> it be a long time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=689.146s">Would</a> that be acceptable?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=708.099s">Second</a> it with the added.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=710.68s">We</a> do not have anything before our meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=713.961s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=714.561s">We</a> have.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.384s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.704s">So</a> we have to figure out when we can do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=728.684s">Anyway,</a> we'll do it as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=730.485s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=770.445s">Mayor</a> Burke, yes, I'd like to suspend the rules and I would like to change the order of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=774.866s">I'd</a> like to have the superintendent's updates and comments follow item four. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=779.547s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1994.714s">No,</a> I just thank you to all of the students who came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1997.875s">It's</a> so nice to hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1999.755s">And</a> I would like if we could send to Judge Klein a thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2005.205s">note</a> from the school committee thanking her for taking the time out of her schedule and coming back home.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2011.469s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2012.11s">I'm</a> sure she would appreciate it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2015.632s">Nice</a> job.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2125.214s">Mayor</a> Burke, if you could have the, maybe we could do a picture afterwards.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3637.727s">I</a> spoke with Marie Cassidy, and in fact, in the auditorium, the magician is going to need to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3644.452s">So</a> we need a different location for that at the McGlynn, perhaps in the library, someplace where we can put a poster up and let people know we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3654.539s">And</a> also, I think it would be advantageous if we had name tags for the committee members.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4559.856s">I</a> seconded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4560.936s">OK,</a> you didn't have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4562.237s">The</a> only other thing I would say is please keep us abreast of when there are fundraisings for this so that we can participate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4571.604s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5804.137s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5805.358s">On</a> the list from the Attorney General, there's Medford Field of Dreams is listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5812.959s">We've</a> had an interesting relationship with the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5816.396s">That</a> one is not, does not show up on our list.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5838.918s">I'm</a> not sure whether they're <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5841.295s">collecting</a> any money right now or? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5843.376s">That's</a> okay, yeah.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5847.038s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5888.003s">The</a> other question I had I think really reflects, I had expected a much longer list. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5893.924s">So</a> it's really the friends of <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5897.505s">all</a> of those ones that you were alluding to earlier that would make sense for us to have a list of two, understanding that those are not 501c3s.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5973.414s">And</a> that was just my other question was, is there a Curtis-Tufts PTO? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5977.675s">There</a> is not that I was able to find at this time.<h2><a href="../2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs/2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs.html">January 14, 2019 Medford School Committee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1471.765s">Just</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1472.506s">When</a> we have our budget book, we have a name, we have a department, and we have an amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1479.849s">How</a> come it works then?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2978.634s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2978.914s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2980.406s">I</a> wanted to remind the committee that we had voted to do a meet and greet prior to the Medford Family Network Valentine's Family Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2992.42s">It</a> was advertised, or the Valentine's Festival has been advertised between 11 and 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2998.406s">this</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2999.231s">which</a> means that our meet and greet, when we were talking about it, would be the hour before 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3004.877s">However,</a> we must ask Superintendent that we have Lisa Evangelista, please, if she would write an article, and we have other advertising going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3015.75s">The</a> idea was that the... <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3018.012s">school</a> committee would be available to meet and greet, and in no way would whatever room we're set up with, would that interfere with any of the setup for the Valentine Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3027.834s">So</a> we need to make sure that it's advertised, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3031.074s">And</a> I just want to remind the membership that we said we would do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3269.916s">I</a> just want to express a little level of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3272.578s">While</a> I'm interested in those numbers, I'm more interested in the confidentiality of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3277.721s">And</a> I wouldn't want any reporting out to put pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3283.985s">Yeah,</a> so just that balance.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3293.472s">Utilizing</a> the pantry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3294.933s">We</a> need to keep in mind, for instance, there was a photo of <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3298.391s">the</a> event that you referenced about the, that not every one of those students necessarily was homeless or whatever, and that it's open to students and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3308.315s">I</a> just wanted, you know, I'm just concerned that because we're interested in the numbers and in due diligence and all the rest, we don't then discourage kids who really need to go from going.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3709.516s">Just</a> one suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3711.117s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3711.397s">On</a> the kindergarten registration parent, the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3717.215s">The</a> next to the last paragraph, it should be Medford Public Schools offers a before and after school program for registered students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3725.637s">Registration</a> for both programs will begin on Monday, April 1st, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3730.579s">Registration</a> forms and pricing information will be available on the Medford Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3736.701s">Somewhere</a> you need to indicate that it is not free. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3742.652s">or</a> that there is a cost involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3744.194s">So...</a> Great suggestion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3745.595s">I'll</a> put that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3746.015s">Suggestion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3746.996s">Also,</a> I haven't figured out how to put it in, but it's not guaranteed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3752.319s">It's</a> not... We've had years where a wait list has needed to be developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3759.044s">So</a> I think it's important that parents available on a first come, first serve basis or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3765.969s">So</a> if you would take a look at that, please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3868.297s">Where</a> it says up on the top?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6398.09s">Van</a> Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6398.83s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6399.331s">To</a> follow up on that, I would like to ask to reach out back to the Attorney General's office and ask them to, in fact, record it so that somebody who's interested but who cannot go at 10.30, I mean, who cannot be in front of a computer screen at 10.30 on January 22nd <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6419.223s">could</a> watch it that evening or watch it sometime other to the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6422.946s">I</a> would really ask if you would go back and at least give them that suggestion and plea because it just seems that, you know, it's just not real to sort of say, oh, everybody, you've got to be available at this time, you know, to do this thing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6451.006s">Someone</a> who's watching other people engage actively could learn a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6455.97s">So</a> maybe we could put a quick letter together from the Medford School Committee asking that they would please <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6463.113s">tape</a> it and have it available at other times for people who can't make it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6970.473s">Would</a> you like to sign all of them moving forward Very good.<h2><a href="../2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc/2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc.html">Medford School Committee meeting January 7, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2118.86s">Vandekloot?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2120.567s">Could</a> you let us know what the projected salary range is? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2125.189s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2126.05s">We</a> can send you a copy of the job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2127.77s">We'll</a> put it in about 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2129.871s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2130.532s">And</a> where would the person be housed?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2292.03s">Are</a> there any open interviews that school committee members could attend?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4664.909s">Dr.</a> Schuster, I just wanted to thank you for coming forward and sharing your knowledge with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4670.192s">I</a> think that for me what really touched home was the increase in the potency in THC. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4677.316s">So</a> thank you for being here tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8257.93s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8258.13s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8259.211s">Two</a> things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8259.771s">First,</a> whenever I hear that there's a program at the McGlynn, which of course sounds like a great idea, being partnered, <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8266.073s">I'd</a> like to ask whether it's going to be similarly at the Andrews.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8275.4s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8276.061s">And</a> then the second part, though, is if it's a McGlynn dance only? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8279.544s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8281.505s">So</a> depending on how that goes, if we're not getting Andrews parents, we should see if we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8288.951s">The</a> other thing is just thinking back, and I believe it was at one of the April 2017 programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8295.666s">That</a> incredibly great movie that was shown.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8302.57s">Oh,</a> that was the screenagers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8303.791s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8304.291s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8305.532s">Different.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8306.412s">A</a> little different.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8309.734s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9130.345s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9131.225s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9131.686s">First,</a> or comments on the transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9136.11s">I'm</a> assuming that this move to two smaller vans is good for the students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9141.723s">And</a> so I just appreciated that we were taking that step to provide transportation for the newcomers in this new way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9150.069s">So</a> I thought that was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9152.091s">Secondarily,</a> sort of to my concern also was, as my colleague, at this time then, there is no limitation on expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9162.439s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9163.54s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9164.181s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9165.882s">Because</a> we, again, we had the same issue when we heard <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9168.782s">that</a> certain people were told they couldn't spend it because they hadn't done it soon enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9173.824s">It's</a> sort of surprising in some ways that people are a little, especially since that's happened in the past, that they're not a little more proactive.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9191.733s">I'd</a> be happy to go help them spend it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9206.25s">Right,</a> because we always know that there's other things that pop up throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9210.912s">The</a> last thing I just want to ask is you said that the business office team has been in transition and key roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9216.654s">I</a> was wondering if you could provide for the school committee a list of the names of all the business office personnel and their job titles or responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9226.008s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9226.388s">Thank</a> you very much, Christine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9228.19s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9228.59s">Mr.</a> Russo.<h2><a href="../2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg/2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg.html">Medford School Committee meeting Monday, December 17, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3092.964s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3093.144s">Van</a> der Kloot is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3095.406s">I</a> think we need you to check into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3097.108s">We</a> received an email just before the meeting tonight asking us why we were not providing both. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3104.314s">It</a> seemed to be well thought out and certainly convincing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3109.618s">And</a> if the machine doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3112.697s">support,</a> there's always a little basket or something that we might be able to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3120.066s">So</a> if you would get back to us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3122.009s">On</a> the other hand, as you said, Paul, we're making progress, and I'm glad that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3127.656s">And</a> I certainly think the initial <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3131.26s">And</a> I think the disbursement of in the locations that you described should say, let's see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3137.906s">But</a> our objective should be to provide the supplies throughout the entire schools.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3151.097s">I</a> think we'll start here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3152.338s">And</a> I think in a short time we need to evaluate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3154.84s">And,</a> you know, I think that's our objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3158.382s">My</a> objective, now that it's been raised to us, it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3161.063s">So</a> anyway, if you would get back to us on that question, and we'll... Point of information, Ms.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3642.812s">Before</a> I call the roll, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.273s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.753s">Yes,</a> before you call the roll, there's just one other sentence that I wish the committee to look at, because I kept on reading it and kept on reading it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3654.377s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.797s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.957s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4031.998s">We</a> don't have that in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4033.338s">Michael,</a> I didn't realize that you didn't have the written minutes for this meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4040.662s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4041.202s">So</a> you are reporting on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4044.104s">The</a> only thing is that there is one item that, because of a time constraint, needs to be reported out from the subcommittee right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4051.648s">So</a> in some ways, the other stuff you're providing for us on this topic, we don't have a report on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4061.494s">The</a> piece that we need to report out because of a time constraint, if I <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4066.77s">if</a> I can proceed, or do you want to go with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4069.292s">Well,</a> I, oh, we can go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4072.193s">You</a> can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4073.234s">Okay,</a> so there's the piece that we need to proceed on is that the subcommittee suggested, Michael's been talking about other ways to make us accessible to the community, and the subcommittee had a long discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4088.904s">And</a> one suggestion was providing, rather than a formal meeting, an opportunity for the community to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4096.068s">meet-and-greet</a> for school committee members for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4102.297s">And</a> to that end, we were thinking about what events already brought the community out, and there's one coming up in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4113.471s">which</a> is the Medford Family Network Valentine's Social. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4118.472s">And</a> so we discussed the possibility of having a meet-and-greet hour before the Valentine's Social, so that at the Valentine's Social, we customarily go and we scoop ice cream, and it's really nice to see people, but it's not an opportunity to get into much conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4138.078s">I</a> did speak to Marie Cassidy about this, and she understood, and she said that if we were to proceed on this, she could put a line in her flyer to say prior, you know, from 2 to 3, come meet the school committee, or whatever, from 11 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4159.815s">But</a> because she's getting that information out to the public, we should <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4165.235s">That's</a> the piece that's critical for tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4224.881s">I</a> can't remember what date it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4226.522s">I</a> think it's the second Saturday.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4260.167s">confused</a> because he thought he was bringing the report to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4262.928s">I</a> have to explain that when you talked to me about it, I thought that the report that was on my desk was the report of this past meeting that we had on December 11th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5905.156s">I</a> just want to mention within all of the things that you mentioned, there also was an incredibly great middle school concert last Thursday night, which I had the pleasure and opportunity to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5919.059s">And</a> as you know, our middle school select ensemble has been gold medal winners many times over. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5928.141s">All</a> of the levels, the 6th grade, the 7th and 8th, and the ensemble really did a terrific job. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5934.442s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5934.763s">Chang</a> is just an amazing teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5937.943s">So</a> I wanted to mention that tonight too. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5940.164s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6872.022s">Yes,</a> just one question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6873.684s">One</a> of the concerns that was brought to us is the heating in the gym, and I've always been concerned about the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6881.092s">Have</a> we included those in our submission? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6884.376s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc/2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 3, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1760.207s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Edward. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1762.048s">I</a> was going to ask if on the key actions for district improvement, number three, rather than saying by June, if you could say by mid-May, proposed key strategies, because I think it's essential that we have some time to hear the strategies and understand what the budget impact might be.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2035.239s">I</a> have a wordsmithing suggestion, and I redid it a couple times, so it got shorter and shorter, but for developing a district-wide focus on instruction, if I could suggest, you might phrase it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2052.912s">By</a> working with principals and other district leaders, we will develop a common language about instruction which will be used as the foundation for improving instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2064.089s">I</a> think that a word or two was left out inadvertently.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2317.68s">So</a> just a quick update, as you know, the MASC hosted the annual joint school committee superintendent conference from November 7th to 10th in Hyannis, Massachusetts, representing Medford were myself, member Paul Rousseau, and our associate superintendent Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2337.644s">Throughout</a> the conference, we attended numerous presentations and events, including the update from the Department of Education <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2343.593s">a</a> presentation involving all stakeholders, school law and legal updates, a presentation on the new super induction program, and many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2354.02s">I</a> myself was particularly pleased to have the opportunity to hear the new Commissioner of Education, Jeff Riley, speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2360.285s">He</a> felt like a breath of fresh air and it sounded to me like he would be more concerned with the whole child <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2365.443s">and</a> will take a more measured approach to standardized testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2368.585s">It</a> was the first opportunity that I had to hear the Commissioner, and I'm hoping that we might set up to invite him to Medford to see some of our wonderful programs, completely like I thought about the CCSR or some of our early child programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2387.438s">I'd</a> like to get the Commissioner here, and it was really wonderful to hear him <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2394.97s">He</a> truly was a breath of fresh air. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2397.532s">Another</a> highlight of the conference was the Thursday morning keynote speaker, Mark Brackett, PhD, a founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2408.94s">Dr.</a> Brackett explained his RULER approach, an acronym for the five key emotion skills of recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, and regulating emotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2418.626s">And</a> I referred to him at our last meeting when we were talking about social-emotional learning issues <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2424.61s">He</a> is going to have some work that we might want to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2431.635s">He</a> was very, very inspirational, and so truly a highlight of the conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2437.72s">Lastly,</a> I myself facilitated the Division II meeting, which is our geographic region for MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2446.186s">We</a> re-elected Stacey Rizzo from Revere to lead the division. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2449.208s">She's</a> a wonderful, active school committee member in Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2454.093s">And</a> finally, I think that the MASC conference is always a way to connect with fellow school committee members from across the Commonwealth and gain an understanding that what we are dealing with here in Medford and issues that are important to us are also important to our fellow school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2470.461s">It</a> provides an opportunity to get a much broader view than just simply, you know, in our local community.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2913.06s">This</a> is a very exciting opportunity for the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2916.061s">And</a> Haley, it's just been so thrilling to watch the band get better and better with every performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2922.142s">The</a> pep rally was just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2924.863s">The</a> performances were just terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2928.304s">And</a> I really need to congratulate you and every member because those kids, they're working hard and they're having a great deal of fun and you can see it on their faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2937.146s">So</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5412.043s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5414.664s">Is</a> what we developed consistent with, does it make sense to have that happen before we see what the state has in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5422.505s">I</a> just want to make sure it works.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5468.932s">But</a> there's no reason not to go ahead, as my colleague suggests, with the form that we developed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5568.282s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-12-03_dEbbUcBxDAE/2018-12-03_dEbbUcBxDAE.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 19, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1551.592s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1551.852s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1552.293s">I</a> just think that that was Judy Lonergan's baby and that she was the one who started it and I think that whenever we talk about we should mention because it was a great idea and she really put a lot of work into it and she got it off the ground and we're really, our schools have really benefited from the fundraising that the run accomplishes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2442.901s">I</a> wondered, as you spoke about the zones of regulation, I know that the Medford Educational Foundation had received requests from different guidance Councilors or whatever for signage, for <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2457.907s">materials.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2458.847s">Have</a> we been able to provide our students with, or each of our schools with some materials to support the zones of regulation?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2474.112s">Yeah,</a> I think that the thing was, our concern was that, well, at the time, it seemed very piecemeal, and we wanted it to be <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2485.386s">unified</a> so that every school had the same sort of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2488.589s">To</a> be honest with you, I see that as a school initiative since we're doing this, that these are things that we should provide our classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2495.374s">So</a> I'd really like to have an opportunity to sit down and see what we've got and what in each school and what really the Councilors and teachers, the principals feel is necessary in terms of some visual reminders.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2531.55s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2532.97s">The</a> foundation didn't want to fund piecemeal projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2536.871s">It's</a> not what we're about, so we've really been waiting for this year to see what the initiative is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2544.553s">And</a> perhaps we'll be able to support it to some degree, but only if we have an understanding that we have a comprehensive approach to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2556.696s">Also,</a> I just want to mention that <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2559.144s">Mr.</a> Rousseau and I, Paul, we had a wonderful opportunity at the school committee conference to hear a professor from Yale speak on social emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2569.007s">I</a> don't have his name with me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2570.387s">I</a> do know he's going to be doing an in-service sort of training, which was really geared for superintendents, but unfortunately it's the same <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2580.285s">days</a> as your superintendent conference down on the Cape. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2583.987s">But</a> I think we should look into it and see if it's a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2587.908s">He</a> was truly inspiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2589.849s">So</a> it might be nice to be able to send someone from our district to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2593.771s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2596.632s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5198.383s">I</a> did get to attend the evening, and I did find it very difficult to get around to all the different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5204.268s">I</a> joined a tour group. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5206.21s">I</a> will say the kids were great, and I heard <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5209.302s">and</a> read in here, in your report, which is terrific, even though you didn't get that many responses, the responses you did get were very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5218.33s">And</a> many of them mentioned how terrific the tour guides were. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5222.133s">But</a> I was a little bit concerned because it did seem that it was hard <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5226.413s">I</a> went back and, you know, went back to the CCSR and then it was all the way back around and it was like, whoa, this isn't, you know, and I started to see people sort of leave their tour group, which was problematical. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5240.74s">The</a> other thing is, and it's just because you're before me, I'm going to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5244.242s">In</a> here, a couple people mentioned it was very hot and I think they were referring particularly to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5251.206s">After</a> that evening, I asked John McLaughlin, <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5254.224s">about</a> the heat issue, and he did tell me that someone was coming in on November 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5260.45s">Is</a> it better now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5263.813s">Yeah,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5264.914s">Because</a> I haven't followed it up in any other way, you know what I'm saying, and so I just was curious how it was.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5274.263s">Yeah,</a> please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5317.159s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5317.819s">Paul,</a> my comments aren't meant to be a criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5320.76s">Oh,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5321.1s">Of</a> course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5321.481s">It's</a> just a question of the fact is that you've got a lot of things to showcase and, you know, it's a relatively short two hours of showcasing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5331.105s">So</a> I'm glad, you know, that it went as well as it did and that, you know, as you, I think it's a continual refinement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5339.228s">Yes,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6814.483s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6814.903s">So,</a> Michael, I've been thinking about this a lot in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6819.224s">One</a> of the things, as soon as you just said ice cream, one of the things that I was thinking about is, and I think there are some things that you haven't really been able to participate in yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6829.687s">So,</a> for example, having a formal meeting and having all of this sort of information fair and volunteer fair and child care and entertainment seems at odds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6843.012s">They</a> don't seem to fit together for me in terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6847.354s">I'm</a> not sure <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6849.144s">what</a> the value is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6849.844s">But</a> there is always value, always valuable being accessible to constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6855.327s">So</a> part of the thing that many of us have done is, for example, in February, the MFN hosts the Ice Cream Social. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6862.551s">It's</a> a Saturday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6864.572s">And</a> I was trying to say to myself, OK, so one piece, for example, is most often, certainly many of us are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6872.876s">Maybe</a> what we should do is start <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6876.538s">45</a> minutes early or something and have an opportunity, meet the school committee members before we go and serve ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6884.845s">Because</a> we always go serve ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6886.566s">Frankly,</a> it's a great time to meet and interact with community members and their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6893.812s">And</a> it's a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6895.153s">But</a> maybe there's a way to formalize a little piece of that so that there's a session beforehand or <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6902.178s">you</a> know, we have our job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6904.099s">And</a> of course, you have to be careful because you don't want to compete with the magician, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6910.24s">So</a> that's one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6911.621s">Another</a> thing that we used to have was an evening with the superintendent, which the school committee members tended to show up at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6919.823s">And</a> for a while, there was a period of time when we actually got a pretty good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6927.105s">It</a> was an opportunity then for the superintendent, and I might say, if we might say, an evening with the superintendent and school committee members for the community to come to hear the initiatives of the superintendent and school committee so that it was sort of understanding what the vision was of the body and doing something which was targeted <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6954.363s">I</a> think the question that, and we've discussed volunteer work in the community engagement subcommittee has talked about volunteer work, to me that almost feels separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6966.409s">Or</a> we have a health fair that happens on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6970.331s">And</a> the health fair would be, if you were to think about health care and volunteering, we already have an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6977.835s">it's</a> well attended, that we could combine a piece where the school committee members are present at that and we might set up other school activities to bring in that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6989.919s">As</a> your resolution stands, I can't support it because I think that it's not focused enough to be valuable because it's going to be an awful lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7005.815s">to</a> create that event and wondering whether it will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7010.258s">But</a> to take your idea and say, which I think certainly has value, and to take a look at different pieces of it and say, how do we accomplish what you want to accomplish in existing venues which we could expand? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7028.452s">without</a> creating so much work, I think has value. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7032.874s">So</a> right now, rather than vote on it, I think the interesting thing is I think it should go back to the Community Engagement Subcommittee and that that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7047.04s">the</a> place to kind of sort out and to identify ways that we could work on this objective without going to one Saturday event. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7059.408s">Now,</a> the other piece of it, which I've mentioned to you just a little bit, I do think that one other thing that we might look at, maybe it comes at the same time when we do a superintendent thing, is helping inform the committee a little bit more about our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7073.216s">So,</a> just another piece.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7075.99s">So</a> I'm making a motion to send it to subcommittee.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2678.019s">Not</a> really a question, but I just wanted to say to the students and to yourself, it was so great to see you at the Cummings event. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2686.023s">I</a> thought it was, I thought the students who asked questions did a particularly good job and it was really nice, especially since Mr. Cummings has been so grateful and generous to the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2697.448s">It</a> was so grateful to see the students in attendance and to express their gratitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2702.49s">Thank</a> you very much for going and for being there and for all the work you're doing both to Rich, Michael, and to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2711.176s">Thank</a> you so much.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=596.807s">It's</a> disappointing that the tiles are not being produced anymore in the sense that a tile gives you an easily replaceable piece, while the pour is a much bigger problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=612.228s">Do</a> we know what the life expectancy of the pour is?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=693.262s">Well,</a> two things that I have to take from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=695.304s">The</a> first is, it's terrific that the grant is still going to cover this, even though it's not a tile. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=702.451s">So</a> I think that I'm greatly relieved to hear that news tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=706.094s">And</a> the second is, as difficult as it was that this project did not move forward quicker, in retrospect, now we can look back and say, thank God it didn't move <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=716.789s">quicker</a> because we would then have an inappropriate tile that was defective. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=723.116s">So</a> God works in strange and unusual ways, and this may be one of them, but I am so very glad to hear that we can move ahead now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=730.303s">Do</a> we need to take a vote in order to accomplish that of any sort?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=742.253s">Do</a> you want to vote again here? <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=743.354s">I</a> think that we need to vote again on the school committee floor.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=850.068s">Does</a> it need to be poured while under a certain temperature?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1238.864s">It</a> sounds great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1276.855s">Very</a> interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1277.976s">You're</a> planning on selling a lot of tickets, but the small cost of the tickets may work in your favor, because everybody can afford a ticket, so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1288.72s">I</a> do want to tell you that you guys are reinventing the Home and School Association, the Medford Home and School Association, <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1295.868s">which</a> has a deep history way back when, because I know it's something that I was involved in way back when, and the idea of it was exactly what you were doing, but at that time we had 13 schools all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1308.992s">And</a> in fact, we had a logo, and the logo was an umbrella because we were bringing everybody together under one umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1314.954s">Not</a> only did we do the sort of fundraising that you're doing, which was to say a citywide component, but we also, and this is just in the future, when you want something to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1325.618s">We</a> ran events, like we brought in the Bennington Puppets, something that, that one's just, we brought in the Boston Ballet, something that one school and group of fundraisers could not do, could not have the energy, but together <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1342.045s">people</a> working together could do really fantastic things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1344.446s">So</a> congratulations, and I'm so glad to see this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1347.447s">If</a> you want any more information about the original, I can certainly tell you, but it is...

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1574.009s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1574.649s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1575.23s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1575.67s">A</a> lot of exciting things happening.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2564.019s">Thank</a> you, Mrs. Lopore, for being before us again. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2567.359s">I</a> looked through this in detail and I thought it sounded wonderfully interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2570.74s">I</a> wish I was going, well, I almost wish I was going until I saw you arriving at 3.45 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2575.921s">and</a> then on the day that you're leaving, you're departing at 4 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2580.042s">So,</a> it is not for the faint-hearted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2583.342s">But</a> anyway, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2585.203s">I</a> certainly will have my support.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3614.591s">So</a> I just want to mention that last year, I think it was myself and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3617.931s">Kreatz,</a> Kathy, were able to attend one of the wonderful events at the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3624.073s">It</a> was really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3625.093s">It</a> was joyous to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3626.593s">And</a> the kids were having fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3628.754s">And</a> clearly, it was a very positive start to their day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3632.775s">So</a> I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3633.655s">I</a> want to thank you for the presentation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3636.476s">I</a> sort of have a feeling that we might be able to reach out to our new principal at the McGlynn and perhaps working together, we can get them involved as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3671.871s">Oh,</a> I think this is Judy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3673.612s">Oh.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4393.387s">I</a> just have one question because I think maybe one of you might know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4397.13s">On</a> Playstead Road, all of a sudden there was a stencil of a bicycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4401.574s">And</a> it's not a bicycle lane, it's going down the middle of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4405.617s">And</a> I've had people ask me if I understand why, rather than Everett Bicycle Lane, we have the stencil in the middle of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4412.444s">So</a> do you know the answer?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4495.202s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4733.832s">Yeah,</a> for the lowest performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4736.072s">And</a> that was something that I know that was very concerning to districts <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4744.98s">in</a> the urban group whose students moved frequently between, say, Somerville, Chelsea, Medford, Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4753.845s">And</a> so there was a group of school committee members spearheaded by Mary Jo Rossetti of Somerville, who's now a city council person, who had worked so diligently on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4763.691s">And</a> this is probably their attempt to address it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5702.764s">On</a> that motion?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5705.365s">Could</a> we ask, first, for how much that would cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5710.348s">And</a> also, then, is it retroactive for the people who just paid already? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5714.57s">So</a> before I vote on that, I would just be more comfortable if we were to bring it back next week.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5804.085s">Megan,</a> could you just give us a review of at least ballpark, because I know it differs a little bit, but what is the tuition?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6673.573s">Hi,</a> Dr. Baer. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6675.655s">We've</a> had the opportunity to meet a couple times already, so it's delightful to have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6681.038s">I</a> had a question, which seems appropriate to ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6684.861s">As</a> part of the school committee's responsibilities at some point, it's our responsibility to assess our superintendent on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6693.426s">But</a> here we have a new superintendent who's only getting her feet wet and doing a tremendous job so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6700.391s">One</a> of those things, if I remember from the past, of course, is that the superintendent develops goals, measurable goals with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6709.516s">At</a> which point with a new superintendent should we begin to think about that process so that we are doing our due diligence in terms of giving her feedback that is responsible and coordinated? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6723.324s">It's</a> perfect timing for that question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8183.293s">I</a> understand my colleagues, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8185.475s">Mustone's</a> urgency about this, and I'm just curious whether there's a different way to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8191.259s">Can</a> we, and you know, I certainly understand the budgeting for this year and next year and whatever, but is there any way that we could <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8200.348s">accelerate</a> our adoption by bringing in in the springtime some more teachers and we could classroom units because you know if I had a student in the fourth grade in the school who was in a classroom who wasn't getting it knowing that my friend student friends child was I'd be really upset and so that well I understand you know piloting and whatever there's there seems like an inequity in <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8225.224s">I'm</a> trying to balance those two needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8228.35s">So</a> I think it's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8230.635s">And</a> sometimes we've worked, if you would, publishers or companies <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8236.525s">to</a> even though we might take something earlier, the payment might still be thrown into the next year, especially because they understand our budgeting too. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8246.749s">So</a> if there was a way that we could accelerate the adoption in the spring and perhaps bring in more teachers by starting with the spring units, I think that's what would be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8256.933s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8340.077s">I</a> clearly was thinking about it, Superintendent, in terms of having a discussion of seeing if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8347.018s">And</a> we've done it before, I mean, over years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8350.732s">We</a> took sort of early receivership of materials and then it was thrown into the next year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8356.255s">Of</a> course, it all depends on the company's willingness to take, you know, to work that out with us or not, but just throw it on the table.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8664.08s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8664.741s">This,</a> of course, better indicates the difference between the McGlynn and the Andrews, which is 24 students apart, still close enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8676.627s">But</a> I did want to report that this weekend I ran into a parent and student, and student as well, who was currently attending sixth grade at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8690.347s">And</a> the parent related to me that they had not been successful in their lottery choice and that she had been put at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8701.937s">And</a> the parent told me she had been very upset at the time and now they couldn't be happier. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8707.822s">And</a> so it was such a heartening story to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8712.325s">and</a> the student was just beaming and repeatedly told me how much she likes being at the McGlynn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8730.114s">She</a> mentioned that multiple times, by the way.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8982.606s">No,</a> they're not.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9188.793s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9188.933s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9190.154s">I</a> just have a letter sent out on behalf of the school committee with our deepest thanks for this gift agreement and I mean it's just fantastic so if you would express our thanks.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9219.68s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9272.403s">Mayor</a> Burke, I just also want to add that while I never was a school committee member contemporary of his, <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9279.325s">I</a> had the privilege and honor of serving with him on the building the future committee and George was a very active and fun and you know we had during that period of time we had more meetings than you can count. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9292.554s">And</a> we sat and we deliberated on so many different things from both large to the small, to the minute, to the color of the tiles and the paint and et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9303.419s">But</a> anyway, George was so much fun and such an active member of that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9307.561s">I</a> will long remember him and feel very grateful to have known him.<h2><a href="../2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM/2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 17, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=381.634s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=383.715s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=383.955s">Van</a> der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=384.555s">I</a> would assume then also we'll get together and figure out some sort of reception that we might have to dedicate the plaque and the room.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=857.098s">Since</a> we haven't approved many liquor licenses, I just want to understand exactly what the process is, if you could clarify.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=885.406s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=885.827s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=899.958s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1308.109s">So</a> if I understand that the steps that need to happen are one, this document needs to be transferred to the Medford Public Schools and listed on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1316.577s">And</a> then some outreach needs to be done so each of the PTOs and organizations are contacted and informed that they need to send this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1326.486s">And</a> so that's a major piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1329.088s">I'm</a> not sure that's all going to happen by the date that we originally had set out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1334.113s">Yeah,</a> probably not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1335.375s">Probably</a> not.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1760.903s">While</a> we're under suspension.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1764.004s">We</a> received in our packets an update on the pressers, which I had requested last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1771.287s">But</a> yet, it was not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1772.607s">There</a> was nothing referenced on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1775.348s">So</a> I just wanted to mention, since we're not going to update the General Welcome, that one of the things that we've seen is that many of our pressers <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1791.415s">with</a> compressors, and as my colleague noted, they're 15,000 a cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1795.057s">So</a> this is a very important, you know, when we had those hot days, and all of a sudden we were relying on the air conditioning, this is a very important piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1807.063s">And</a> obviously, before we put off being able to replace these compressors when they should have been, I'm making the point of it because I think that, you know, as we speak about a, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1819.922s">capital</a> plan, this is clearly a unit, a place that we need to consider now, putting money aside, so that when we have these hot days, as we did at the historic school, we will be able to turn on the air conditioning effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1834.915s">So</a> I just wanted to reference that since it was proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1837.077s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2322.017s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2323.837s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2329.21s">Thank</a> you, Christine, for continuing your work on this and for the people at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2333.973s">And</a> thank you, Cheryl, for being tenacious and bringing the information last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2340.656s">I</a> can't wait for the dedication.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2360.566s">Good</a> evening, everyone.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2922.92s">Superintendent,</a> well, you've had a chance now to get your feet wet a little bit, and I'm just wondering what your plan is in terms of an administrative assistant, or whether you're still thinking of what the central office should look like.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2957.769s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4597.6s">Just</a> for clarity, we are not moving the report on Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4601.601s">We</a> are reporting the issue of our, just to be clear, of our language achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4608.103s">Yeah.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ/2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 6, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=609.023s">Heston.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=718.841s">It's</a> just a wonderful thing for us to be starting out this school year with the teacher's contract in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=728.566s">And</a> so that for all the people who worked on it and made sure that it happened so that we could cast our votes tonight, we're very, very happy and thankful.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1375.281s">She</a> did.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1442.765s">Yes,</a> I also got calls letting me know that you were on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1448.187s">And</a> people just really felt the same way that I did, that Mr. Benedetto and my colleagues did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1454.29s">What</a> a great way to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1455.971s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2295.646s">John,</a> I just wanted to ask, obviously, we've had a very hot start to the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2302.192s">How</a> was bringing all of our air conditioning on and did it work?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2388.126s">All</a> right, so can you, if I could ask for a follow-up report of each of the schools and where we are in terms of the compressors, how many we need, so that we're aware of it, because obviously with the start of school like this, we need it to come online and work.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3079.833s">You</a> gave us two samples. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3081.774s">One</a> was black topped and the other one was a sandy color. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3084.755s">Which</a> one will be used?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3098.0s">I</a> was just concerned about the black top.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3107.723s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4320.524s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4325.862s">But</a> what I'm understanding is that Mrs. Rodriguez is saying we don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4329.985s">We</a> could use the statewide contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4331.666s">And</a> I haven't quite figured out the discrepancy between what she's saying and why we would reopen the bid process.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4352.075s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4353.016s">So</a> would we do the product through the statewide contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4359.479s">Is</a> there any difference in what we've received? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4361.54s">And</a> then?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4371.946s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4378.57s">And</a> then we would, then we would have to bid the labor?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4385.01s">No,</a> no, no, no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4452.325s">So,</a> Mayor Burke, is it possible, since we all want to resolve this in the best possible way, is there possible that we could ask someone from the procurement office to sit down with Christine, with Mrs. Rodriguez, maybe with yourself, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4465.715s">and</a> talk, maybe talk to the, I just don't want to do anything illegal if we're not, you know, because we've already had a bid, so we need to be careful about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4474.783s">But</a> could we, clearly we can't settle it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4478.066s">Clearly</a> we want this, we want that playground done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4481.369s">I'm</a> extraordinarily disappointed that it wasn't accomplished this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4486.253s">So</a> could I make a motion that, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4490.694s">the</a> procurement office, Mrs. Rodriguez, Christine Patterson, sit down with this, perhaps have a discussion with the contractor who Mrs. Rodriguez talked with to see if there is a way to move forward on this for a less expensive.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4828.512s">Well,</a> I've made a motion that we have people sit down and talk to each other, including Mrs. Rodriguez, so that people are at the same table because questions have been raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4840.018s">It's</a> very difficult for us right here to be able to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4843.98s">And</a> so since there are discussions and everybody wants the same thing, we all want the same thing on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4851.223s">So</a> I would ask my colleagues to second and vote on my motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4871.714s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4872.375s">I</a> said anybody who's germane to the process.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5428.144s">Yes,</a> I have a motion though saying let's get... For a meeting, an immediate meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5432.725s">Yes,</a> for people around the table to get together because there still is a discrepancy and I still believe it's important for both, for every person. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5440.748s">And</a> I'm not casting aspersions any way of saying that someone did the wrong thing or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5445.65s">RFP</a> has to be very detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5448.691s">I</a> understand that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5452.652s">Obviously,</a> Cheryl has invested a great deal of time into this, and we're very grateful to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5460.215s">So,</a> let's get people around the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5462.636s">We</a> can't solve it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5465.076s">So,</a> I ask to call my motion, please, and I believe you seconded it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5486.306s">And</a> Kirsten, who thinks to be there as well?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5496.565s">I</a> don't have any problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5497.786s">So,</a> I mean, if we wanted to include a school committee member.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5911.92s">Could</a> we ask that there be an update about the Leslie project and collaboration, either at our next school committee meeting or the one following that, depending on what's most appropriate?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6535.904s">And</a> it was, it had to go, and again, I really have to look back. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6540.147s">It</a> had to go to committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6542.009s">It</a> couldn't just be done on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6543.51s">We</a> couldn't just say, oh, yes, we're going to name it for somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6547.053s">And,</a> you know, more, a little more information needed to be coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6551.697s">I</a> mean, I'm sure we're all in favor of Lena being honored, but there is a process, and I think that there's a reason to keep to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6560.11s">So</a> I think we need to send it to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6563.813s">And</a> I do forget there's some recommendation involved if we could look into it and check back to what it was just so that we're following our policy.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6618.055s">Yeah,</a> the band room is now a designation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6623.038s">I'll</a> get some information to the superintendent so that she can send it out and we can set up a meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6632.864s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6633.584s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6633.864s">Yeah,</a> again, we can't vote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6635.365s">There</a> was definitely a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6636.586s">We</a> can't just vote it at a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6638.568s">And</a> we can look at it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6643.591s">I</a> believe that there was, we could have it in a separate meeting before. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6647.574s">The</a> reasoning behind it, there was a very exact reason behind it, which hasn't always been followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6653.875s">It's</a> true, but the reasoning behind it is that we just didn't want someone coming up and all of a sudden saying, oh yeah, we should name this four, without reflective thought, and does that make sense, and what is the larger picture, so that's why.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7151.853s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7152.033s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7153.113s">Yes,</a> Diane, I just wanted to also thank you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7155.814s">I</a> know that you've had, as you've, we've been in this transition, you've had a large role and I wanted to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7163.674s">Thank</a> you, Ms.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8089.459s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8089.939s">But,</a> so on one day we've got 141 <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8095.839s">sixth</a> graders at the Andrews, and another day we have 140. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8099.241s">But</a> what we want to know is, without children being absent, how many, what is the number?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8111.948s">But</a> we have the, what is the maximum number that are showing up now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8121.073s">What</a> is the maximum number that are enrolled at that school?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8131.155s">So</a> what we need and what Paul is saying is in order to determine what we're looking at, we really <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8138.695s">these</a> numbers are the snapshot of the day as opposed to the potential large picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8144.758s">And</a> what I understand is you're saying I can't, I don't quite have that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8149.54s">What</a> we're wondering is, you know, all of a sudden we see that the sixth grade is the same and then on the next day it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8159.245s">So</a> we don't know, we can't tell by this, did we lose some people who then maybe enrolled their child at a different school <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8167.152s">because</a> of the issues around the sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8169.574s">So</a> we need a follow-up report on that when we get maximum numbers.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8932.882s">last</a> year, and I'm glad you were proactive and not a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8936.623s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9767.743s">So</a> for a while, PTOs, there was a period of time <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9772.268s">when</a> different school PTOs did in fact take some of that on and were buying in bulk and coordinating the supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9782.191s">You</a> know, it's one of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9783.231s">It</a> takes a lot of effort and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9784.912s">So</a> you have a parent who's revved up about it and it lasts for a couple of years and then kind of falls by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9791.574s">It's</a> certainly beneficial, but it is a, you know, it's just one more thing of organizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9799.016s">But</a> that isn't to say that it isn't worth trying to do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10053.971s">I</a> wanted to know whether we've replaced the teacher at the vocational school, the marketing teacher, whether we found someone to, I believe, that position retired or left for another?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10076.529s">Okay,</a> so one teacher did leave though, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10078.791s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10080.251s">Okay,</a> thanks.<h2><a href="../2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8/2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 18, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=658.695s">Yes,</a> I'd like to suspend the rules, order of business, so that we can take up the new business, the CASA.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2609.115s">Point</a> of information, that no good deed goes unpunished.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3185.192s">First,</a> I think that it's great that Erin, you've done the work on the homeless issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3191.197s">And</a> Michael, you're interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3192.238s">It's</a> certainly one that the MASC, Massachusetts Associated School Committees, has been interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3198.582s">Unfunded</a> mandates altogether has been a constant theme of their trying to, of advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3205.648s">And</a> it's very, very frustrating that the number of unfunded mandates that school systems have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3213.027s">On</a> the budget overall, I think it's a, I was very pleased to see that the bottom line had risen and that we were able to accommodate so many things that we did want to put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3230.28s">I</a> think that, Mayor, we're putting a great deal of trust in you because the other night you did, in response to one of my questions, mention that once you understand the level of free cash the city has, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3242.692s">that</a> we would be looking at a capital budget, which is just so essential now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3247.556s">We've</a> actually been putting it off a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3249.438s">When</a> we came in, I think maybe two and a half years ago, we actually have done, we have the list of things that needs to be done, although they need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3258.965s">But</a> some of those very same things, for example, playgrounds and whatever, they're on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3264.149s">And</a> there's much smaller items and much bigger items. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3266.771s">I</a> think that is the one place in the budget which is just a little tough because, for instance, when I see <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3271.506s">The</a> $100,000 in telephone savings, that would have been nice to be able to keep in the budget, but I have to be realistic about the demands of money on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3280.133s">And</a> so I'm putting my trust in you, Mayor Burke, to make sure that we are going to move forward on a capital budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3287.352s">I</a> think that there's, we always have to understand, I said several times last week, that we are essentially in the bottom line, approving the bottom line of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3296.414s">That's</a> what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3297.534s">And</a> that there always has to be understood that there will be some changes and some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3302.515s">So</a> when we talk about areas that are of concern, that we might be seeing changes, hopefully, in the ways that the committee would like to direct over the next couple of weeks and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3315.778s">So</a> I'd like to put a motion forward to approve the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3323.96s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3325.22s">To</a> approve the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3326.961s">Because</a> my daughter is employed in the vocational program, I'd like to sever the vocational salary budget for $2,416,682 and vote on that separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3336.343s">And</a> then put forward a, so with <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3343.794s">someone</a> else could put forward that motion to approve that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3347.056s">And</a> then I would put forward a motion to approve the rest of the budget, 58,608,631, which will give us a grand total of 66,629,011. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3353.621s">Is</a> there a motion on the floor for approval of the vocational salary budget for fiscal 19 of $2,416,682? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.064s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.364s">It's</a> a motion by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.985s">Kreatz.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3399.351s">Abstain.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3693.914s">So</a> I just want to mention that after our budget meeting on Thursday, by chance I found myself walking out to our cars with the new superintendent-elect, and she and I had a very interesting discussion about the kindergarten aides and what her <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3714.053s">what</a> she would like to see for kindergarten age, what she would want expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3720.118s">She</a> obviously would very much like to see support in kindergartens, but she also had some very clear ideas which were, I don't think it's for me to share, but I can guarantee you from that discussion that I've had with her, I don't think that this is just something that's going to go by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3737.952s">I</a> do think we want her to be able to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3740.273s">I</a> think we've talked about that there is some <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3742.843s">levels</a> of flexibility in the budget that we need to hear the report from the security company to determine which way we're going forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3750.208s">And</a> so without, I mean, again, it's a little, I don't want to speak for her, but yet I do want to share with my colleagues that I had a most interesting conversation about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3759.154s">And</a> I feel comfortable from that, that she has a direction.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3978.623s">I</a> just, you know, I guess it's a different, different way of approach because for me, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3983.437s">I</a> am voting for all the teachers who are in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3986.421s">I'm</a> voting for all the administrators who are in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3988.704s">I'm</a> voting for all of the supplies that are in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3993.249s">I'm</a> voting for all of the coaches who are in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3995.612s">I'm</a> voting for all of the different, every level of different things and <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4001.989s">While</a> I certainly understand the importance of some of the smaller other issues that people are bringing up and are concerned about, and I share that concern too, there are so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4015.232s">I</a> think a vote no for the budget says that we are not providing adequate monies to educate our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4023.273s">And</a> I believe that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4025.014s">I</a> think that we always would like to have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4027.65s">Everybody</a> would like to have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4029.471s">But</a> this is a sound budget.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4164.0s">appropriate</a> to thank all of the people who worked on the budget, particularly our superintendent of finance, Christine Patterson, and everybody else who just helped put this together, who did number crunching, who did paper collating. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4180.349s">It's</a> a huge job, and we're most appreciative.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1029.705s">So</a> first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1034.228s">When</a> that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1046.855s">And</a> it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1056.23s">I'm</a> very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1061.074s">I</a> have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1065.637s">I</a> could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1077.187s">So,</a> projectile is probably the word that I really want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1082.651s">So</a> I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1084.612s">ask</a> if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit, and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1115.042s">maybe</a> some signage too about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1130.891s">Also,</a> in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1140.997s">Does</a> it matter that there's a slope?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1161.944s">Okay,</a> and how about watering the trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1164.325s">Making</a> sure they've got enough water.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1181.21s">And</a> I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1188.312s">I</a> think it's great, girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1189.412s">Thank</a> you so much for your presentation tonight.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3248.321s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3249.622s">So</a> obviously there's a lot we can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3252.524s">Smaller</a> groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3259.129s">And</a> being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3267.434s">However,</a> I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3275.798s">that</a> we might also think about, there are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3292.65s">whatever,</a> for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3295.932s">And</a> I'd really like to see both of those happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3300.574s">If</a> we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3307.798s">January.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3308.459s">Very</a> end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3309.399s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3309.719s">So</a> would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3314.242s">What</a> would your optimum <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3317.007s">timing</a> be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3349.496s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3349.837s">Well,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3350.457s">I</a> mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3354.099s">And</a> I realize that it is difficult to get <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3356.154s">faculty</a> members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3364.016s">But</a> thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4113.003s">van</a> der Vloot, I love the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4115.985s">A</a> couple of questions in terms of practicality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4120.366s">You</a> know the Italian <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4122.727s">exams</a> that you take where the kids, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4125.129s">The</a> national exams.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4137.438s">Okay,</a> so how much does the AAPPL?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4154.684s">And</a> students take it as in their, when of their senior year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4169.369s">So</a> they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4180.233s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4181.536s">But</a> it doesn't really come then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4183.077s">It's</a> really given at graduation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4192.702s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4193.322s">So</a> it's really given at graduation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4196.644s">I</a> mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will because they would like to get it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4210.408s">It's</a> a relatively small cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4211.929s">How</a> many kids do you anticipate would take it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4214.33s">You</a> said you were 20.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4230.518s">Okay,</a> so we might have 40 or 60?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4356.849s">I</a> appreciate Mrs. DiCarlo for bringing us this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4360.372s">I</a> mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4978.983s">Yes,</a> I just too wanted to add my thoughts and I know we're going to see you again but it's been a long wonderful journey with you and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4994.068s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5073.276s">Once</a> approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5074.236s">Yes,</a> they have, they have the whole report, yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6101.186s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Teixeira. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6103.247s">I</a> guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at McGlynn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6115.933s">Which</a> I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6123.737s">But</a> yet at the same time, I think that there is an inequity that builds into our system <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6129.375s">where</a> we don't have EL students at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6134.763s">Given</a> the numbers that we have now and the redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the Andrews?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6244.326s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8206.652s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8206.832s">Van</a> de Kleef. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8207.76s">So</a> once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden we've got three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8214.124s">One's</a> from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8218.888s">At</a> that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8282.753s">So</a> tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8291.295s">So</a> I'd make a motion that we <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8293.392s">go</a> forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8323.01s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8667.045s">I</a> didn't have a question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8670.606s">So</a> I just want to ask a question in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8673.827s">So</a> right now we've got 169 kids at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8680.029s">And</a> we have two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8683.81s">Each</a> team is made up of four classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8687.191s">If</a> we do the math, that means <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8689.528s">that</a> there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8707.877s">So</a> I was talking about core academic classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8710.178s">I</a> mean, the two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8711.199s">If</a> you would, it means there would be 85 on each team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8715.321s">And</a> of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8727.807s">Now,</a> we've been very proud of our class size numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8731.789s">And</a> frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8736.119s">So</a> certainly for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8746.465s">But</a> if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8749.866s">We've</a> got many elementary kids' classrooms where there might be 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8754.309s">So</a> I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8759.231s">We</a> understand how much pain this causes parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8763.143s">I</a> don't know in terms of the inequity in terms of our teaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8767.006s">There</a> may be teachers at the Andrews who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8821.19s">Well,</a> history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at the projections over all the years, there was a clear swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8831.916s">In</a> fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8834.518s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8858.584s">No,</a> I was looking at her face.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8950.336s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8951.537s">I</a> mean, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8952.437s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8954.178s">You</a> know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8967.227s">So</a> just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8987.22s">So</a> in terms of the split that currently is in place, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8997.837s">Is</a> the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9020.706s">Darn.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10289.302s">So</a> along that same line of thinking, we have said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10302.709s">They</a> don't have any additional friends there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10305.31s">They've</a> been made to go to a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10307.771s">So</a> frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10315.181s">The</a> six who are going to the... Two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10319.403s">Two?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10320.824s">Six</a> didn't request anything and they're going... Oh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10324.706s">All</a> right, so then... Two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10325.807s">Okay,</a> it's two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10326.787s">But</a> still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so... I don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10911.611s">Fingers</a> are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.051s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.232s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.832s">So</a> actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10918.253s">And</a> obviously, he didn't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10920.114s">Now</a> we're zeroing in on one particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10924.517s">Setting</a> up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school on a day or the end of where parents might be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10937.727s">I</a> think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10950.156s">I</a> mean, that's how I'd go about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10953.127s">And</a> then I think you set a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10954.408s">I</a> think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10965.077s">But</a> you set that up this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10966.938s">You</a> said send a letter home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10969.1s">You</a> have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10976.826s">You</a> have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, the fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10984.271s">At</a> the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11001.097s">So</a> I think that that would be beneficial no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11004.018s">I</a> understand Mr. Tucci is just taking on a new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11008.68s">This</a> is just <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11010.449s">I</a> just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11014.452s">I'm</a> not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11081.839s">I</a> would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11086.682s">I</a> mean, certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11087.635s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11087.815s">Galusi</a> can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is, whether there would be any to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11096.602s">And</a> I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11103.087s">Well,</a> the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11106.13s">I</a> mean, you know, and then we make it clear that it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11110.854s">But</a> at least we've given it another shot.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.316s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.416s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.536s">Vander</a> Kloof up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11460.937s">The</a> only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11476.255s">that</a> we were not, the sound was not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11480.917s">And</a> that was actually very helpful for us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11483.818s">So</a> I think, I mean that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11493.481s">So</a> I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11505.218s">The</a> only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11515.883s">And</a> I wondered, I sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11522.086s">Sorry,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11599.544s">Does</a> the emergency cover the sound off?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11603.265s">Does</a> the emergency cover that the sound is off?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11623.812s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11624.472s">Well,</a> I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11630.516s">I</a> just want to make the clarification.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11633.278s">Yeah.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.507s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.607s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1029.707s">So</a> first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1034.252s">When</a> that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1046.875s">And</a> it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1056.207s">I'm</a> very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1061.091s">I</a> have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1065.654s">I</a> could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1077.203s">So,</a> projectile is probably the word that I really want. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1082.667s">So</a> I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1084.629s">ask</a> if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1115.056s">maybe</a> some signage, too, about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1130.92s">Also,</a> in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1141.003s">Does</a> it matter that there's a slope?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1162.011s">Okay,</a> and how about watering the trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1164.333s">making</a> sure they've got enough water.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1181.24s">And</a> I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1188.343s">I</a> think it's great, girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1189.644s">Thank</a> you so much for your presentation tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1530.41s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1530.59s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1531.351s">I</a> think that one of the things which makes this particularly <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1535.388s">is</a> that the fact that you guys are just freshmen now and you're gonna be able to, you're gonna have a piece of this throughout the rest of your high school career. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1543.71s">And</a> that really makes this even more meaningful than if you were seniors going out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1548.311s">So,</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3248.337s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3249.638s">So,</a> obviously, there's a lot we can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3252.558s">Smaller</a> groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students, and being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3267.461s">However,</a> I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3275.815s">that</a> we might also think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3277.197s">There</a> are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3292.687s">whatever,</a> for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3295.97s">And,</a> you know, I'd really like to see both of those happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3300.595s">If</a> we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3307.822s">January.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3308.503s">Very</a> end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3309.424s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3309.744s">So</a> would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3314.269s">What</a> would your optimum <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3317.024s">timing</a> be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3349.532s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3349.872s">Well,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3350.473s">I</a> mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3354.116s">And</a> I realize that it is difficult to get <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3356.191s">faculty</a> members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3364.058s">But</a> thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4115.182s">I</a> love the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4116.002s">A</a> couple of questions in terms of practicality. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4120.384s">You</a> know the Italian exams that you take where the kids just like- The national exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4126.126s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4126.307s">We</a> do it in all three languages.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4137.474s">Okay,</a> so how much does the AAPPL?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4154.718s">And</a> students take it as in their, win of their senior year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4169.383s">So</a> they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4180.247s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4181.193s">But</a> it doesn't really come then. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4183.094s">It's</a> really given at graduation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4192.719s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4193.339s">So</a> it's really given at graduation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4196.681s">I</a> mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will, because they would like to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4210.426s">It's</a> a relatively small cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4211.967s">How</a> many kids do you anticipate would take it? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4214.348s">You</a> said you were 20.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4230.539s">Okay,</a> so we might have 40 or 60?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4357.069s">I</a> appreciate Mrs. DeCarlo for bringing us this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4360.411s">I</a> mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4979.018s">Yes,</a> I just too wanted to add my thoughts, and I know we're going to see you again, but it's been a long wonderful journey with you, and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much, and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4994.085s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5073.07s">Yes,</a> they have, they have the whole report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5075.711s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5075.851s">I</a> don't see, no, we didn't get to pricing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6101.219s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Teixeira. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6103.28s">I</a> guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at the McGlynn.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6115.944s">Which</a> I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6123.746s">But</a> yet at the same time, I think that there isn't any equity that builds into our system <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6129.395s">where</a> we don't have EL students at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6134.778s">Given</a> the numbers that we have now and <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6138.231s">the</a> redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the McGlynn?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6244.34s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6497.281s">No,</a> I, yes, I'm fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8207.797s">So</a> once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden, we've got three. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8214.161s">One's</a> from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8218.905s">At</a> that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8282.767s">So</a> tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8291.329s">So</a> I'd make a motion that we <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8293.408s">go</a> forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8323.04s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8667.061s">I</a> didn't have a question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8670.642s">So</a> I just want to ask a question in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8673.862s">So</a> right now, we've got 169 kids at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8680.063s">And</a> we have two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8683.824s">Each</a> team is made up of four classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8687.205s">If</a> we do the math, that means <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8689.545s">that</a> there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8707.839s">So</a> I was talking about core academic classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8710.201s">I</a> mean, the two teams, if you would, it means there's <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8712.954s">there</a> would be 85 on each team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8715.336s">And</a> of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8727.828s">Now,</a> we've been very proud of our class size numbers, and frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8738.732s">Certainly</a> for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8746.496s">But</a> if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8749.898s">We've</a> got many elementary kids classrooms where there might be 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8754.34s">So</a> I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8759.242s">We</a> understand how much pain this causes parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8763.184s">I</a> don't know in terms of the inequity, in terms of our teaching staff, there may be teachers at the <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8771.894s">Andrews</a> who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8821.202s">Well,</a> history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8828.686s">at</a> the projections over all the years, it was a clear swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8831.948s">In</a> fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8834.529s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8858.596s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8859.477s">No,</a> I was looking at her face. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8861.779s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8950.352s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8951.552s">I</a> mean, I do, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8954.214s">You</a> know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8967.243s">So</a> just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8986.596s">So</a> in terms of the split that currently is in place, are there... <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8997.87s">Is</a> the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10289.117s">So</a> along that same line of thinking, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10294.142s">have</a> said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10302.729s">They</a> don't have any additional friends there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10305.332s">They've</a> been made to go to a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10307.794s">So</a> frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10310.796s">Where</a> are you getting the six from?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10315.22s">The</a> six who are going to the <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10319.11s">The</a> two?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10323.553s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10323.993s">All</a> right, so then two. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10325.834s">OK,</a> it's two. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10326.815s">But</a> still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so I don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10911.628s">Fingers</a> are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.088s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.249s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.869s">So</a> actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10918.29s">And</a> obviously, he didn't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10920.131s">Now</a> we're zeroing in on one particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10924.553s">Setting</a> up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school, on a day, or the end, just where parents might be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10937.763s">I</a> think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance, and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10950.173s">I</a> mean, that's how I'd go about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10953.144s">And</a> then I think you set a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10954.445s">I</a> think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10965.113s">But</a> you set that up this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10966.954s">You</a> said send a letter home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10969.135s">You</a> have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10976.841s">You</a> have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10984.286s">At</a> the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11001.117s">So</a> I think that that would be beneficial no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11004.039s">I</a> understand Mr. Tucci's just taking on a new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11008.722s">This</a> is just <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11010.463s">I</a> just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11014.466s">I'm</a> not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11077.674s">Well,</a> I think you need a night meeting when parents can... To be honest with you, I would do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11081.856s">I</a> would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11086.699s">I</a> mean, certainly Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11087.839s">Galusi</a> can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11093.918s">whether</a> there would be any to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11096.62s">And</a> I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let him. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11103.104s">Well,</a> the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11106.306s">And</a> then we make it clear that it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11110.869s">But</a> at least we've given it another shot.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.332s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.412s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.552s">Vander</a> Kloof up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11460.952s">The</a> only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11476.269s">that</a> we were not, the sound was not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11480.951s">And</a> that was actually very helpful for us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11483.833s">So</a> I think, I mean, that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11493.497s">So</a> I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11505.257s">The</a> only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11515.9s">And</a> I wondered, I just sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11599.579s">Does</a> the emergency cover the sound off?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11603.3s">Does</a> the emergency cover that the sound is off?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11624.489s">Well,</a> I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11630.553s">I</a> just want to make the clarification.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11633.295s">Yeah.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU/2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU.html">School Committee 05/07/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2403.459s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2403.619s">Van</a> der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2404.8s">Yes,</a> Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2411.183s">They've</a> asked if we could move them up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2417.286s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4519.509s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4520.617s">I</a> just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4524.679s">I</a> appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4543.95s">maximize</a> the potential for every student at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4547.571s">It's</a> unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4555.795s">I</a> do not make the leap that I think some have. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4559.376s">There</a> was a lot of tension. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4560.637s">We</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4561.457s">I</a> think that's a fact that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact many of the <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4567.337s">McGlynn</a> teachers came and addressed the school committee, but in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4588.568s">our</a> staff, our people who are working at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4591.79s">I</a> only see bright things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4593.41s">I</a> know, you know, there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4599.733s">And</a> so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5788.16s">Melanie,</a> I just wanted to mention one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5791.742s">I</a> think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5801.497s">Certainly,</a> as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5809.562s">And</a> in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5821.449s">So</a> I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5830.017s">and</a> know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5840.062s">By</a> the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5848.811s">feeling</a> of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5856.257s">And</a> remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5862.141s">And</a> so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6718.864s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6719.044s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6720.606s">Mayor</a> Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6729.442s">excluding</a> that as a potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6730.822s">But</a> they have to be reviewed by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6732.243s">Yes,</a> but they would be, we would be part of that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6735.463s">Now,</a> of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6745.285s">Um,</a> but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there, there, there certainly needs to be movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6757.428s">For</a> instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6758.577s">we</a> might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6765.244s">We</a> don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7694.111s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7694.532s">So</a> I just want to mention a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7697.054s">I</a> think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7718.331s">However,</a> she's retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7721.132s">The</a> deputy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7722.353s">The</a> deputy superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7723.554s">Beverly</a> Nelson.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7725.096s">So</a> she's retiring.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7727.077s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7728.839s">She's</a> retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7730.32s">This</a> is not the time to ask her in her career, as she winds down, for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7739.829s">Another</a> potential would have been Dr. Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7743.672s">Well,</a> I don't think it's appropriate to then <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7747.531s">ask</a> the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7755.053s">Things</a> change. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7756.713s">I</a> don't think that the superintendent is able. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7760.754s">I</a> believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7778.543s">So</a> I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7786.988s">I</a> think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7796.572s">But</a> I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7799.994s">I</a> think that they were extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7804.917s">In</a> my mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7806.223s">there</a> was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7819.23s">So,</a> if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7832.537s">But,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7835.548s">For</a> me, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7847.35s">And</a> of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7860.172s">I</a> feel that we are elected <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7864.3s">in</a> the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7881.189s">For</a> me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7885.451s">And</a> in my mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7887.135s">It</a> was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep a experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7956.408s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7957.609s">So</a> I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7965.215s">I</a> think that you meant the question now, you know, in a respectful way and that responded by saying, hey, this is the plan, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7975.193s">There</a> were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7978.174s">There's</a> another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7988.658s">We</a> need to look at the large picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7995.027s">and</a> determine what was the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7997.207s">And</a> I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8000.328s">The</a> only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8012.41s">Two</a> did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8016.051s">But</a> this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8021.912s">Five</a> of us agreed that this was the best way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8025.166s">In</a> going forward, absolutely, especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration, we'll need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't, hopefully we won't in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8040.138s">We</a> wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8049.686s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9083.703s">So</a> I just have a couple of thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9088.084s">If,</a> I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Eduard Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9103.708s">Now,</a> I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9118.662s">And</a> so I would want to see us move on, I understand there might be some negotiations involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9125.209s">I</a> don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9133.235s">Obviously,</a> he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9146.943s">I</a> mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well, here there's no principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9153.027s">So</a> the first thing we have to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9155.257s">is</a> move on that appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9157.338s">That</a> would be my number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9158.979s">The</a> second is, the most obvious is that we have a group of students, there's 21 students at the McGlynn, and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9171.744s">Now</a> maybe not all 21 would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9174.278s">but</a> certainly if there's, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9185.706s">So,</a> you know, I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9198.436s">But</a> over time, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9200.577s">And</a> Mr. Martelloni did this very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9203.178s">He</a> showed us in his graphs how it had changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9207.84s">We</a> put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9213.042s">So</a> I think that, and down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9224.146s">But</a> I definitely think that we should at least send out letters <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9229.037s">To</a> parents we need to put a principal in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9231.458s">We</a> need to have and we need to at least target Maybe the McGlynn elementary students saying would you be willing now again? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9240.019s">There</a> may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs to change But then maybe on the other hand someone's gonna be here who the principal is and the rest of the group and they're gonna say Hey, I kind of like him for my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9250.381s">He</a> would be a good match So that would be my first thought
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10529.628s">Just</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10530.369s">I</a> think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10542.661s">However,</a> clearly it does make more sense for him also <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10546.5s">if</a> he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10553.044s">Also,</a> ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10562.368s">That</a> did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10569.39s">these</a> schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10575.976s">And</a> it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10580.42s">So</a> we'll talk about that at our next meeting too. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10583.943s">I'll</a> make sure that people get a copy of it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11525.564s">So,</a> because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11528.326s">Of</a> course, there should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11529.207s">And</a> we definitely need more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11531.89s">I</a> would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11556.398s">We</a> would also, at that meeting, is very much want to make sure to have an understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11564.475s">the</a> impact on our student usage at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11569.116s">And</a> security, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11570.677s">Obviously</a> is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11573.337s">I</a> have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11586.592s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11586.852s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11587.753s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11878.95s">Going</a> forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11886.307s">I</a> think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11892.269s">So,</a> and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11900.713s">I</a> think that if we, if the new superintendent elect has had, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11907.329s">some</a> experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11917.653s">I</a> will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11934.82s">He</a> just might be very useful in <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11937.607s">saying</a> how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11938.767s">I</a> do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11944.289s">But</a> if we could reach out to him as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12829.297s">I</a> just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12865.235s">I</a> just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12877.51s">I</a> was over at Midea one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12878.932s">I've</a> talked extensively to them, and they see it as a positive, a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12884.06s">their</a> engineers are having a great time with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12886.661s">So</a> I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12891.222s">So</a> I would like us to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12893.583s">I'd</a> also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12899.825s">We</a> know that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14627.153s">I</a> just wanted to thank you for staying so long tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14629.993s">I</a> know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15810.538s">just</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15811.299s">On</a> the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15818.484s">Can</a> we insist that they be paid twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15824.969s">Because</a> if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15832.289s">I</a> don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15852.962s">When</a> are they due? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15854.323s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15854.743s">When</a> is the payment due?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15858.308s">It</a> just makes me a little nervous.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15883.799s">But</a> I guess I'm just suggesting a twice a year collection as opposed to... Again, these were contracts in place, so I didn't have that option.<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14/2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 7, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2403.479s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2403.679s">Van</a> der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2404.84s">Yes,</a> Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2411.221s">They've</a> asked if we could move them up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4519.544s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4520.645s">I</a> just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4524.728s">I</a> appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4543.984s">maximize</a> the potential for every student at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4547.607s">It's</a> unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4555.854s">I</a> do not make the leap that I think some have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4559.417s">There</a> was a lot of tension. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4560.698s">We</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4561.518s">I</a> think that's a fact, that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact, many of the McGlynn teachers came and addressed the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4569.973s">But</a> in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are our staff, our people who are working at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4591.823s">I</a> only see bright things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4593.443s">I</a> know there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4599.763s">And</a> so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5788.194s">Melanie,</a> I just wanted to mention one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5791.776s">I</a> think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5801.55s">Certainly,</a> as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5809.595s">And</a> in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5821.482s">So</a> I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5830.05s">and</a> know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5840.096s">By</a> the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5848.842s">feeling</a> of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5856.286s">And</a> remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera, and so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6718.895s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6719.076s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6720.637s">Mayor</a> Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6729.476s">excluding</a> that as a potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6730.876s">But</a> they have to be reviewed by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6732.277s">Yes,</a> but they would be, we would be part of that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6735.498s">Now,</a> of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6745.321s">Um,</a> but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6755.383s">there</a> certainly needs to be movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6757.444s">For</a> instance, we might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6765.287s">We</a> don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7694.144s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7694.564s">So</a> I just want to mention a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7697.085s">I</a> think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7718.354s">However,</a> she's retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7721.166s">The</a> deputy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7722.387s">The</a> deputy superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7723.528s">Beverly</a> Nelson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7724.348s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7725.129s">So</a> she's retiring.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7727.11s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7728.892s">She's</a> retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7730.353s">This</a> is not the time to ask her in her career as she winds down for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7739.86s">Another</a> potential would have been Dr. Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7743.702s">Well,</a> I don't think it's appropriate to then <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7747.565s">ask</a> the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7755.09s">Things</a> change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7756.751s">I</a> don't think that the superintendent is able. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7760.793s">I</a> believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7778.578s">So</a> I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7787.024s">I</a> think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7796.611s">But</a> I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7800.034s">I</a> think that they were extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7804.957s">In</a> my mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7806.26s">there</a> was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7819.264s">So,</a> if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7832.568s">But,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7835.582s">For</a> me, and you know, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7847.385s">And</a> of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7860.209s">I</a> feel that we are elected <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7864.333s">in</a> the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7881.24s">For</a> me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7885.482s">And</a> in my mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7887.168s">It</a> was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep an experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7956.439s">van</a> de Kloet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7957.64s">So</a> I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7965.363s">I</a> think that you meant the question now in a respectful way, and that we responded by saying, hey, this is the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7974.328s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7975.227s">There</a> were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7978.208s">There's</a> another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7988.692s">We</a> need to look at the large picture and determine what was the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7997.256s">And</a> I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8000.36s">The</a> only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8012.443s">Two</a> did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision, but this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8021.965s">Five</a> of us agreed that this was the best way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8025.206s">In</a> going forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8026.731s">Absolutely,</a> especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8031.555s">We'll</a> need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8036.859s">Hopefully</a> we won't in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8040.182s">We</a> wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8049.729s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9083.744s">So</a> I just have a couple of thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9088.118s">If,</a> I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Edouard-Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9103.751s">Now,</a> I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9117.394s">Absolutely</a> key and so I would want to see us move on I Understand there might be some negotiations involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9125.243s">I</a> don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9133.269s">Obviously,</a> he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9146.976s">I</a> mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9151.204s">here</a> there's no principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9153.046s">So</a> the first thing we have to do is move on on that appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9157.389s">That</a> would be my number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9159.01s">The</a> second is the most obvious and is that we have a group of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9163.554s">There's</a> 21 students at the McGlynn and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9171.8s">Now</a> maybe not all 21 would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9174.309s">But</a> certainly if there is, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9185.738s">So</a> I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9198.469s">But</a> over time, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9200.61s">And</a> Mr. Martelloni did this very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9203.211s">He</a> showed us in his graphs how it had changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9207.874s">We</a> put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9213.076s">So</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9215.547s">And</a> down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9224.175s">But</a> I definitely think that we should at least send out letters to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9229.521s">We</a> need to put a principle in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9231.523s">We</a> need to have, and we need to at least target maybe the McGlynn Elementary students saying, would you be willing? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9239.606s">Now,</a> again, there may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs a change, but then maybe on the other hand, someone's going to be here who the principal is and the rest of the group, and they're going to say, hey, I'd kind of like him for my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9250.416s">He</a> would be a good match. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9252.238s">So</a> that would be my first thought.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10529.662s">Just</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10530.403s">I</a> think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10542.695s">However,</a> clearly it does make more sense for him also. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10546.553s">if</a> he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10553.077s">Also,</a> ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10562.402s">That</a> did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was the—I mean, when <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10569.423s">these</a> schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10576.008s">And</a> it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10580.451s">So</a> we'll talk about that at our next meeting too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10583.994s">I'll</a> make sure that people get a copy of it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11524.35s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11525.611s">So</a> because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11528.392s">Of</a> course, there should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11529.232s">And</a> we definitely need more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11531.913s">I</a> would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11560.33s">very</a> much want to make sure to have an understanding of the impact on our student usage at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11569.153s">And</a> security, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11570.734s">Obviously</a> is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11573.375s">I</a> have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11586.642s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11586.882s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11587.782s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11878.984s">Going</a> forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11886.341s">I</a> think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11892.303s">So,</a> and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11900.747s">I</a> think that if we if the new superintendent elect has had <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11907.363s">some</a> experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11917.688s">I</a> will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11934.877s">He</a> just might be very useful in <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11937.641s">saying</a> how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11938.802s">I</a> do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them, but if we could reach out to him as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12829.339s">I</a> just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12865.269s">I</a> just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12876.978s">photographs</a> I was over at Midea one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12878.959s">I've</a> talked extensively to them and they see it as a positive, a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12884.1s">Their</a> engineers are having a great time with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12886.701s">So</a> I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12891.262s">So</a> I would like us to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12893.622s">I'd</a> also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12901.393s">can</a> say that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14628.488s">for</a> staying so long tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14630.03s">I</a> know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15810.575s">Just</a> real quick, on the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15818.524s">Can</a> we insist that they be paid twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15825.011s">Because</a> if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15832.323s">I</a> don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15852.999s">When</a> are they due?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15860.512s">Yeah,</a> it just makes me a little nervous.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3246.734s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3247.094s">So</a> the report also included information about the finalists that were brought to the school committee by the Superintendent Search Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3257.782s">Those</a> four finalists were Dr Maurice and Ward Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3262.025s">Dr.</a> Perrella, Dr. Straight, and Mr. Thomas Martelone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3265.767s">Tonight,</a> the committee met prior to this and voted to continue looking into the backgrounds and speaking with Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent and Mr. Thomas Martelone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3279.974s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3696.076s">So</a> this is one of those topics that goes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3702.921s">But</a> when I first got involved, the first topic that I brought together a group of parents to talk about was called Leave My Child Alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3711.027s">And</a> that was the first forum that we had to discuss this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3717.793s">And</a> it's come to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3718.693s">I</a> absolutely agree that now that the technology that's <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3723.517s">has</a> just brought Atlanta to a whole new level. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3726.299s">Now,</a> back in, I think it was around 2010, school committee, Anne Marie Pugnell, working with Representative Paul Donato, we did a couple of public forums as well around the topic of polling. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3740.31s">At</a> that point, we did put together a rather extensive policy and some procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3746.434s">It</a> seems to me that what we need to do is we need to review those, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3758.208s">that</a> everybody's on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3760.19s">And</a> it's probably time again that we again do a public program about educating parents about bullying and how they can help their students.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3777.459s">At</a> that particular point, Ann Marie was working with
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4137.261s">Do</a> we want to make it a committee of the home?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5107.189s">Motion</a> to accept the report and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5110.333s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5332.743s">Yes,</a> just for the response to intervention, do we need any additional monies for planning for that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5372.606s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5373.106s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5373.326s">So</a> I'm just wondering whether we're going to need to build in more money for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5377.448s">It</a> just seemed earlier that when we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5381.89s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5415.721s">So</a> that's really what I was getting at, because I know some systems do have paid tutors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5421.404s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5421.724s">And</a> I don't know whether it's something which we can get volunteer tutors or whether we are going to need, because of consistency, to have paid tutors and how much that might cost us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5432.228s">So</a> I guess I just thought that might be a budget item.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5455.187s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5456.428s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6818.596s">Mrs.</a> Anderson? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6820.157s">So</a> if I understood, you just said a classroom per grade in each school? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6825.479s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6825.799s">So</a> for the kids who aren't piloting the program, we were concerned about our science curriculum overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6833.075s">And</a> also the ability of kids to do hands-on stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6837.141s">So</a> as we're piloting programs, how are we making sure that the other students who are not piloting the programs have the same <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6850.618s">opportunities</a> as those who are getting the new materials.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6912.123s">So</a> is your plan to make a new recommendation for whatever program we're going to go with by next year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6924.56s">It</a> can't be too long.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6932.669s">We're</a> not ready to go now.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7388.319s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7392.963s">So</a> I just had one more question, and that is, when we do implement FOSS, what is the approximate budget amount that you anticipate?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7417.085s">So</a> I just, we are not moving forward this year because we want to vet it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7425.308s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7425.768s">Not</a> because we're not, we can't afford it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7429.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7431.19s">Just</a> making sure.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=367.419s">And</a> I'm not sure if- When you say instructional focus, are you meaning instruction curriculum overall, or are you, is there different instructional methods that differentiate the schools?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=506.928s">So</a> tell me about one of the biggest challenges in working in your current position.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=572.985s">But</a> what is your challenge?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2915.003s">We've</a> spoken about some of your successes, but I want to hear how you've been tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2921.35s">So</a> could you speak about, I'll say, two occasions where you did not succeed in something or where you actually failed and what you learned from it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2946.843s">It</a> could be like an implementation of a program not going well or an interaction with a student's family for something, whatever.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5693.313s">A</a> couple of them, but they're short. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5696.554s">So</a> just budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5698.175s">When</a> you did your superintendent training, did you have experience with a particular budget in a particular community during that training?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5711.334s">No,</a> just, I didn't know if you worked with a particular mentor in a particular community that did budget with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5717.516s">I</a> just didn't know.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5755.534s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5757.234s">Next</a> question is, if you could go to the Board of Education tomorrow and advocate for change, what would you be talking about?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5825.741s">So</a> what other measures would you like to use?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3059.777s">How</a> did you identify that grant?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3109.531s">Mr.</a> Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3112.032s">Hi,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3758.639s">So</a> Dr. Strait, I would like to know what being an educational leader means to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3764.221s">And</a> have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3769.563s">Or,</a> or and, if you could tomorrow, what would you like to address them on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3925.442s">And</a> this took place when I was living in- Just FinCom is financial?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5259.409s">Dr.</a> Strait, when we put together the application, I kept on thinking that we really ought to put one of those warning boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5267.255s">And</a> the warning box would say that our current superintendent is available 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5271.459s">And</a> he works around the clock, and we can always get him. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5276.022s">And</a> he's been on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5278.204s">I've</a> talked to him when he's on vacation, which is a rarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5282.207s">And</a> frankly, quite honestly, we're just used to that accessibility to our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5288.172s">So</a> I just want to warn you, OK?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5294.696s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5296.037s">So</a> I just want you to understand what our expectation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5300.619s">Because</a> quite honestly, no joking aside, that really is quite a difficult place to follow on. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5308.984s">Having</a> said that, I'd like you to know what you do for fun, and what you do in your way, and how you de-stress.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5395.296s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5399.299s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6495.012s">Dr.</a> Perella, decision-making is a two-edged sword. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6498.695s">Some</a> situations call for decisiveness right at the start while others involved consensus building. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6505.24s">Tell</a> us about a situation where you were decisive and how it worked out for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6508.863s">Then</a> tell us about the time when you weren't decisive enough and what you learned from it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6616.55s">So</a> John, why don't you speak to some accomplishment that you've done through collaboration and why you particularly see that as successful?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6674.894s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6675.874s">Mr.</a> Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6676.194s">Ms.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7892.89s">John,</a> what does being an educational leader mean to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7897.053s">And</a> have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue, or if you could, or and if you could, if you could go before them tomorrow, what would you address them on?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8026.06s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10009.887s">One</a> of the things that you've done here, and it's easy to, it really wasn't that long ago, but it feels longer ago, was that you oversaw the reconstruction of the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10020.535s">And</a> as superintendent, there's the educational leadership, there's the budget, there's negotiations, and there's also keeping up with the buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10030.702s">What</a> was the most challenging aspect of having a major building project in the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10036.106s">And</a> what did you learn from the experience?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10224.383s">Now,</a> John, you gave me a perfect segue because in your answer you mentioned anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10229.565s">And</a> the other question I really wanted to ask you tonight was about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10232.686s">One</a> of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10237.208s">How</a> do we balance the emotional needs of students while maintaining academic rigor? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10243.11s">And</a> I wondered if you could give me any, obviously because of confidentiality, I want to be very careful, but could you give me examples of how we can do that?<h2><a href="../2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI/2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI.html">School Committee meeting March 19, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2114.983s">It's</a> just great, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2116.104s">Thank</a> you for all your work and the work, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2117.845s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2119.006s">That's</a> easy to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2122.049s">I'm</a> thinking, of course, just that it just makes things so clear and it's great work.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2130.535s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3226.35s">I</a> just want to say that it's not been unusual over the years for the school committee to occasionally comment on something that's coming before the city council and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3235.092s">The</a> city council also comments on, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3237.526s">stuff</a> that comes beyond us, so I feel comfortable in supporting the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3244.051s">I</a> see the library as an essential element in any community, and I particularly want it to be a beautiful library in mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3250.977s">And</a> we all know that the library needs some updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3253.679s">It's</a> not particularly a surprise or a shock to any of us who have been in it, and we want <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3260.932s">we</a> would like to see improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3264.133s">I</a> think in terms of being members of the school committee, it just goes hand in hand with our caring about and dedication to our Medford children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3272.037s">So</a> I appreciate the resolution and I certainly will support it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3290.12s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4347.555s">No,</a> again, I just wanted to add my thanks to Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4352.6s">And</a> also just to say that parents came before us at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4358.004s">And</a> it was difficult because we didn't respond to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4360.086s">We</a> didn't say anything about, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4363.135s">After</a> they left, I said, I just want to say I hear your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4366.177s">So</a> we really, we did hear their concerns and took appropriate action. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4371.781s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4372.401s">And</a> I'm glad the open house went so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4375.263s">My</a> colleague, Mr. Russo and the mayor, we were, we were off at the superintendent search committee that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4382.228s">So</a> I didn't get to go, but I'm glad that it went so well.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4939.984s">We</a> kind of like to go.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5445.086s">Hands?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.098s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.238s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5448.159s">So</a> I too was surprised to hear how long this training was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5453.801s">At</a> my workplace, Winchester Hospital, just up the road, Winchester police came in and did run, hide, fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5463.166s">And</a> those are the three words that you use, run, hide, fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5466.727s">And</a> it seemed much more targeted and concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5469.569s">I</a> personally will be speaking with Officer Convino so I understand the differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5474.371s">And</a> we might also <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5477.325s">I</a> don't know if he's planning on coming to your subcommittee meeting, but if not, perhaps he could come to another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5485.049s">Anyway,</a> just because we've been using Alice because it's kind of been the original catch word, but I'm not sure that's the only approach, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5495.695s">I'm</a> a little puzzled about the time commitment, because it does seem extensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5502.018s">I</a> also wondered whether Officer Covino has, for Rennheide Fight, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5506.92s">there's</a> a movie, which is maybe 15 minutes long.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5514.944s">Yeah,</a> I think if there's a way for the committee to access that video so we can see it too, would be very useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5521.867s">So</a> I will reach out to him myself to ask my questions around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5526.889s">But</a> maybe if he could be included.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=670.524s">Is</a> that something you can easily get to us, or is this going to cause a great deal more work?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1730.802s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1731.887s">I</a> actually concur because I saw the difficulty in trying to do it as a curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1736.511s">The</a> reason why we didn't just remind people was because there's six of us and we each have one subcommittee and then I think in the past it was, well, everybody wanted to be on that subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1748.36s">We've</a> now already had differentiated with a subcommittee for selection committee, so I actually think that doing a separate committee makes a lot of sense.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2353.601s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2353.862s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2355.25s">Anthony,</a> thanks for your good work last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2357.091s">We</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2358.591s">We</a> didn't expect anything less from you, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2360.872s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2361.232s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2362.873s">In</a> terms of the vacation week camps, are we doing another one in April?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2390.49s">I</a> certainly understand that, but it may be that we should look at to see if there's someone else who could do it, since it does fulfill a need in our community at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2401.239s">And</a> I was curious, during the winter February vacation, did the students use the pool?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2427.117s">Okay,</a> thanks very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2428.218s">Yeah,</a> of course.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3025.123s">Yeah,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3027.925s">Diane,</a> I have a relationship with one of the Burlington elementary teachers, and that's what really sparked my interest, our long conversations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3038.813s">And</a> I do know that she said that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3041.517s">The</a> tutors were extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3043.198s">But</a> I also, and I'll check back with her, but I wondered whether, is this something you could, could you train any volunteers? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3052.345s">Or</a> is it too extensive?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3078.614s">Right,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3080.014s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3080.995s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3423.629s">Could</a> you please tell me how many students are signed up to go?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3440.783s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3441.504s">I</a> think it's great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3455.872s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3699.318s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3699.739s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3702.06s">While</a> we are under suspension, I wanted to talk about our subcommittee meeting, Mr. Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3710.657s">So</a> typically, we send things to subcommittee meetings, but Mr. Ruggiero has proposed that we have a subcommittee meeting on community outreach this Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3723.26s">And</a> perhaps I could just ask you to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3726.341s">I</a> just want to make sure that the rest of the committee knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3730.442s">I</a> had asked that there be a preliminary meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3734.263s">Unfortunately,</a> it doesn't seem like timing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3736.384s">And</a> Mr. Ruggiero, I just want to mention that it needs to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3741.076s">And</a> that means you need to contact the superintendent's office to have that happen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3787.622s">I</a> just want to make sure we officially post it towards our regulations.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3797.946s">Could</a> you announce what the agenda is for the meeting?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3847.605s">Okay</a> I'm certainly hoping to be there planning to be there, but you know sometimes I would do work in an environment which can be tricky Thank you for the information
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4090.906s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4091.106s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4092.207s">I</a> just want to make sure, though, that we received one report which had the name of a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4100.192s">And</a> I just want to make sure that it's deducted, because we should not have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4106.016s">Also,</a> we do have a protocol for, what's it called, Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4111.139s">I</a> can't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4113.12s">A</a> protocol when a student says something or is of concern <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4118.083s">a</a> safety care, and I think that we should remind everybody that that is in existence and in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4125.306s">If,</a> in fact, a student makes some kind of threat, but the safety care protocol is followed, then while the school committee can be informed, I just, I received one robo-call from a principal, and I wondered how, if nothing was, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4146.802s">if</a> there was no reason to be concerned after professionals had assessed the child, and it was an elementary school child, and kids will be kids and say things, that I didn't want to, I think there's a balance between what some would call transparency, and my concern would be heightened <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4173.024s">I'm</a> just wondering where the line is so it's not too much and it's not inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4177.947s">And</a> that we're protecting our students appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4182.43s">So</a> I think it's a balance that we need to achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4187.253s">I</a> think we probably need a little practice with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4189.074s">But</a> I do think that we put in place a couple of years ago the safety protocol for assessing situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4196.278s">And</a> I think that we need to make sure that we're sticking to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4199.367s">And</a> if nothing is determined, and it was by Elliot, then I don't think that there's a reason to alert every parent that a third grader said something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4212.573s">Because</a> sometimes third graders say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4214.354s">I</a> mean, they're kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4216.115s">They're</a> kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4217.416s">And</a> we have to recognize that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4219.797s">In</a> our concern about safety, we also need to be concerned about safety <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4230.656s">and</a> worried about or realizing the impact on the fact that these are children.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4329.813s">And</a> will you be bringing that to us at our next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4335.457s">Hopefully.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4336.057s">We</a> can get it done by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4337.238s">That</a> would be great.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5773.399s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to add my voice to thanking all of your teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5778.061s">I,</a> you know, attend as many concerts as I possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5781.643s">I</a> know Mrs. Kreatz and I and some other members were at the winter concerts and, you know, you listen to the orchestra concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5790.987s">It</a> is the thing that makes me, I think, so proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5795.619s">when</a> I can talk to other people and say, yes, all of our kids get to, you know, try out stringed instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5803.486s">And</a> then they can do something in fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5805.468s">And</a> people really are amazed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5806.649s">I</a> mean, I tell them how many people we have in our orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5810.072s">And</a> then the band concert, the winter band concert, it was just blow your socks off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5816.518s">just</a> so I wish everybody had been able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5818.979s">So</a> I really appreciate all the hard work of your teachers and yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5822.479s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5823.12s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5869.916s">Vandekloot?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5870.477s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5870.717s">I</a> had a question because I understand that, um, the, um, that there's going to be an election or preliminary election and is it the first day of school?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5916.888s">So</a> we would have school on September 4th? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5920.915s">or</a> school would be in session?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5943.913s">Well,</a> I'm just a little concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5946.235s">The</a> students grade 1 to 12 go back the 28th, 29th, 30th, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5951.518s">then</a> they're off Friday, they're off Monday, and then Tuesday would be the election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5958.782s">I</a> mean, clearly when we think about concerns about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5961.623s">So</a> I just, I think we need to think this through and look at that particular date. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5967.046s">I</a> don't know if any other members have thought about this yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5972.128s">I</a> don't want to leave them out of school for, it seems difficult to leave them out of school for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5978.491s">So,</a> but I was a little concerned.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6172.716s">We</a> have had school before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6175.538s">And</a> if we have school, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6182.612s">people</a> who come in to vote at the schools are segregated from completely? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6188.276s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6189.237s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6248.092s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6248.772s">It's</a> not just one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6252.173s">Um,</a> when do kindergarteners go back to school? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6257.154s">Uh,</a> beginning September 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6261.316s">Um,</a> beginning September 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6263.396s">And</a> the day that we're talking about is September 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6266.461s">correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6268.343s">Have</a> we set the voting machines up in the kindergartners, kindergartens at all at the Brooks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6274.548s">At</a> the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6275.869s">Yeah,</a> because I mean, if you can think of, is there a way just to isolate? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6279.171s">I'm</a> just looking at a way to isolate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6298.23s">I</a> think the rest of the calendar, I think that the only question that we have a concern about is September 4th and how to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6305.993s">I</a> guess for you it impacts the other day, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6309.174s">Can</a> we hold it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7049.565s">Miss</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7050.606s">Technically,</a> it's supposed to come in by Wednesday, by noon, although I know that there is a certain amount of leeway that's usually granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7060.431s">But</a> just people need to be aware that our packets are received on Friday, so that it, you know, they can't come in at Friday at 5 and expect it to go out to us in a timely manner.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7281.468s">Yes,</a> Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7282.128s">I'm</a> a little bit troubled just how, um, when we just had people before us, we wanted to be clear that we couldn't deliberate on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7292.79s">But</a> I just wanted to add a sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7294.251s">I</a> think that I would have added earlier if I had realized that we're going to walk away at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7297.511s">But,</a> um, I just, it just the fact that we have it deliberated on it doesn't mean that we didn't hear the parents and their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7305.293s">And</a> that's an important distinction to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7306.833s">Certainly</a> we've been C receiving emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7309.334s">I</a> think that we're, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7312.821s">that</a> we're, I'm sure that every school committee member, if I can dare to speak for the body, is concerned about this issue and waiting to, we can't make a decision here or whatever, but I think that there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7329.41s">that</a> I would like to say that I heard them and have heard from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7336.974s">And</a> if there is a better solution or whatnot, I'm sure that's something that we might take up at a different point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7345.838s">OK?</a> <h2><a href="../2018-02-28_9sQ1QM-0eSg/2018-02-28_9sQ1QM-0eSg.html">Medford School Committee 02/27/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1786.221s">So</a> the question to follow up on Mr. Russo's question really is, is for the students who are in the sixth grade, are we looking at their math scores, the ones who came from the Columbus, are we looking at their math scores and seeing whether any of them need extra tutoring or?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2553.929s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2555.89s">Recently</a> the DESC put out some new, I don't know, they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2573.034s">had</a> an elongated time out, there was an option other than tacking on school days at the end or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2581.737s">I</a> haven't read it completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2583.917s">I</a> was thinking that we would be talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2587.438s">I</a> definitely think, though I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access the work that the teachers prepare for them and that is tricky in our <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2600.272s">community</a> where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2607.956s">You</a> know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2615.32s">So</a> if you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2624.325s">I</a> see this not so much for the one or two day absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2627.527s">I</a> see this in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2629.735s">how</a> to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard, that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2967.374s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2967.535s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2968.155s">So</a> yes, I just wanted to formalize my thought then and along with Erin's. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2973.9s">I'd</a> like to ask that the curriculum subcommittee review the recent DESC paper on alternatives for snow days so that we can begin this discussion.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3075.645s">I</a> just want to congratulate our representative from the high school, Sebastian Tringali, on his recent acceptance to Tufts University.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3092.493s">It</a> means he'll be nice and close.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4034.405s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4034.485s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4035.366s">So</a> I have first, the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that it also included all of those booster clubs or athletic support groups as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4048.853s">I</a> think September 1st is a bad day to pick because it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4053.81s">off</a> on Labor Day weekend, I think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4062.938s">I</a> understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4069.683s">However,</a> I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like, Mr. Superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4077.752s">micromanage</a> who's going to go to what bank and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4080.795s">We</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4082.996s">We</a> just can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4084.037s">We</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4085.118s">And</a> if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4090.562s">But</a> I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, of which I belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4102.89s">that,</a> well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4106.611s">So</a> I just want to put that out there and say, makes me real nervous when you went down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4112.733s">And</a> I don't think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4115.214s">I</a> think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4122.857s">Because,</a> for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation, we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4127.712s">We</a> have a principal sign-off sheet, however, we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4136.17s">that</a> we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4140.672s">And</a> when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4147.274s">Because</a> we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4154.617s">Now,</a> how formally you play them out is another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4156.958s">But</a> somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws, because if you're a 501c3, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4162.58s">You</a> needed to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4163.98s">You</a> needed to specify how the offices worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4169.582s">So</a> even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4180.405s">Anyway,</a> otherwise than that, I think that we can send it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4183.346s">But</a> those were some of my initial concerns.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4288.98s">Before</a> you move on, though, I do know that there are members of the <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4298.335s">Are</a> there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4559.544s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4559.724s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4560.865s">It</a> would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4577.995s">raise</a> money for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4580.396s">I</a> know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that, how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4598.849s">money</a> is raised that the kids get the opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4601.711s">And</a> so I just think that it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4604.292s">You</a> know, many of you won't remember this and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4610.476s">Diane</a> Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4620.159s">And</a> that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts, because way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4635.564s">And</a> they were all, blessedly, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4637.358s">that</a> it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4643.302s">And</a> sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4648.485s">So</a> within all of this and this discussion, by putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5556.47s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5556.55s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5559.952s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5571.116s">You</a> meant to be speaking up for parents, and in fact, were responding to parents' requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5577.659s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5578.739s">And</a> I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5582.861s">I</a> have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5586.683s">I</a> don't think you meant to be heavy-handed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5588.403s">I</a> don't think you meant to cause this uproar. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5591.205s">I</a> don't think so at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5593.085s">I</a> do think you were inexperienced, and frankly, you learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5598.428s">Because</a> you see, you know that it's caused great upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5603.171s">That</a> was very evident the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5607.194s">We</a> agree that we've now got some new things that have come out of this, maybe, and maybe that's all for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5613.899s">But</a> there were some really hurt feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5618.062s">The</a> treasurer has asked for an apology. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5620.984s">Saying</a> I'm sorry doesn't cost you anything, and it would help to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5627.086s">I</a> understand that you didn't mean to hurt, but frankly, you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5634.711s">It</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5636.172s">It's</a> happened to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5637.953s">I</a> didn't mean to, but it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5640.174s">And</a> I said, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5641.815s">Sometimes</a> those two little words are just the easiest thing to say if they're heartfelt and meant, because I truly believe, I truly believe that you meant no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5652.902s">I</a> look forward to working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5655.784s">I</a> look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5657.427s">figuring</a> out what it means to be a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5659.548s">You</a> and I have already had some discussions about personal styles, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5664.171s">And</a> in my view, it is time to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5668.954s">But</a> in order for that to happen, you need to say something.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6844.869s">Before</a> we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion, which I thought Mr. Ruggiero might. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6851.436s">Today,</a> Mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information, and I think that there was <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6864.766s">One</a> piece, which I was uncomfortable with, which actually had to do with the ski trip, it didn't have names on it, but if there was names, I wanted that to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6873.793s">I</a> wasn't certain that I wanted everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going, what time they were going, whatever, just as a safety thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6882.961s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6884.042s">it's</a> long been a thought that I know other school committee members share, that some of our documents, rather than having this big stack of papers, could be online for us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6899.065s">And</a> so I think that we should take both things together, figure out, there were some questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6909.645s">afterwards,</a> which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6913.087s">So</a> it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6921.87s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to effectively put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6938.777s">minimize</a> the amount of paper that we have for our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6944.359s">As</a> a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist, and frankly, it's just way too much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6975.102s">OK,</a> I made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6976.183s">Do</a> we want to just officialize it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6989.769s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6990.349s">We'll</a> include that in the amendment.<h2><a href="../2017-12-19_TZU2d7XxyA0/2017-12-19_TZU2d7XxyA0.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 18, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=287.839s">So</a> Mr. Zigny, before you and the students go, first I want to tell you how much I was looking forward to hearing you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=294.485s">So</a> it's made our night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=295.406s">Thank</a> you so very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=297.087s">I</a> will also tell you it made our night when we went to the orchestra concert at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=302.672s">I</a> don't think you could get another student on that stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=305.574s">It</a> was unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=307.275s">As</a> well, myself and some of my colleagues, including the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=310.458s">And</a> Kathy Kreatz, we were able to go to the middle school concert as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=313.921s">And</a> it's just, I felt so proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=316.462s">And</a> so proud of our students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=318.143s">You</a> represent us so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=319.745s">And</a> it's so magnificent that we have this interest in our music program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=323.927s">And</a> it's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=325.148s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=326.049s">Now,</a> Mr. Zigny, though, I actually happen to have something I have to give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=329.451s">So</a> if you wouldn't mind coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=331.973s">This</a> is kind of funny, but I just happen to be given a donation of drumsticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=336.656s">and</a> from someone who was formally connected and did a student internship at Medford High, and he remembers us so fondly, so here's some drumsticks for you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=783.315s">So</a> if you would, Mrs. Cugno, I think that tonight it would be appropriate to just quickly say that we met at 6.30 on December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=794.462s">All</a> of us were present, as well as Michael Ruggiero, school committee elect, Paul Rousseau, school committee elect, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=801.197s">The</a> superintendent, deputy superintendent, director of curriculum, Bernard Riccadeli, and community members, Jen Graham, Michelle Ciccolo, and Franco Leary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=811.287s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to establish a process for the selection of the next superintendent, to identify the criteria for selection, to review application forms for candidates, and to initiate a process for selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=825.005s">The</a> superintendent spoke about different items, going over what our challenges would be, what its job description should be, giving us some information about the MASS, that's Massachusetts Superintendent Organization, salary information, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=842.152s">The</a> outcome of this meeting was that the mayor appointed a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=847.694s">She</a> appointed me as chair, Mrs. Mustone, Mrs. Kreatz, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=854.897s">It</a> doesn't say here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=856.258s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=856.858s">Jen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=857.678s">What's</a> your name? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=858.058s">Jenny</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=858.879s">And?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=860.179s">Michael.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=860.879s">And</a> Paul Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=861.66s">And</a> Paul Rousseau, sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=863.781s">And</a> we are going to meet this Thursday, December 21st at 715 up at the high school to carry forward our charge of coming up with a questionnaire and also a information document that could be given out to prospective candidates.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=888.743s">PM.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=890.485s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.827s">We</a> had talked about AM, so it's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=893.929s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1520.248s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1521.248s">A</a> couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1522.389s">I</a> just wanted to mention that in our folders, we also received all the other things, all the other plans, adding 15 minutes of math instruction daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1535.78s">Chromebook</a> practice so that we had a further report which covered additional in-school items that would be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1549.063s">It</a> also, though I just wanted to clarify, and Mr. Superintendent, I know we're being redundant here, but I understand that you're now committed to having a after school tutoring for the math students paid for by the district, because I'm just clarifying that, because earlier there was a rumor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1570.231s">And</a> so I want to put that to rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1572.253s">And</a> committed to working out transportation, after school transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1577.339s">It</a> sounds like so far, financially, you've committed to at least two days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.464s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1583.786s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1584.266s">I</a> know that your request would have preferred three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1586.969s">I</a> think two is probably a reasonable place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1589.852s">So,</a> okay, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1591.213s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1592.053s">And</a> I would like to thank you very much from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1595.734s">You've</a> been very, very concerned about this issue, Maureen, and I thank you for coming forth and addressing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1603.336s">And</a> see, I told you it'd be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1605.717s">The</a> other thing, too, is, though, I think that when I went and first met Maureen at the math night, one of the things that just stood out so <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1616.244s">much</a> that night was when I had a great discussion with some of the teachers, and they were telling me about all the different things our math program could do, but then admitted that not every student had access to that at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1627.95s">So</a> by providing this after school time, this gives them an opportunity to utilize those, our math program to the full. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1635.894s">So</a> thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you, Maureen.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.188s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4251.464s">Yeah,</a> so I think tonight we've seen, you know, heard about three different projects, which are very different, and I thank you so much for coming forward and telling us about your project, and girls also, about your projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4265.395s">When</a> you look at the project portfolio that the school committee members received, the scope of the projects is really just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4271.96s">And</a> it makes me, again, feel so very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4275.167s">Because</a> here we have kids coming up with projects, all sorts of different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4278.948s">What</a> a wonderful idea to have role models come in and speak to our students and for you to be interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4285.75s">And</a> then, you know, I read another one, one of our students, and I suspect we'll hear from her gladly so, is concerned about the styrofoam that we use for trays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4295.093s">And</a> I could go through each one because there are so many positive, wonderful projects that kids came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4302.195s">And</a> not just came up with, but then went forward and said, we're going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4305.878s">We're</a> going to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4306.939s">And</a> I think that you've already made a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4309.241s">And</a> I'm so proud that you're making a difference in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4311.742s">So</a> thank you very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4312.963s">And</a> I'm just grateful that the CCSR has flourished and taken off, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4319.769s">And</a> I know that the leadership has been extraordinarily positive and helpful in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4324.492s">And</a> so I thank them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4325.853s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.08s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.26s">Vander</a> Kloof? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5483.221s">So</a> just a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5486.602s">On</a> the front page, you say we'll cap the charges at three meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5491.105s">for</a> middle and high school students and five for elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5495.308s">But</a> then if I understand it, they can still take a regular meal.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5542.948s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out, first of all, in terms of the alternate lunch, are cheese sandwiches an option for all the time for everybody?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5555.515s">Okay,</a> because one of the things that we worked hard is not to signal students out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5582.163s">So</a> three days in a row is pretty short time, is what I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5589.348s">And</a> I'm just thinking about for a family who's got a sort of short-term crisis, I mean... In regard to
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5645.851s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5646.291s">Well,</a> you know, obviously my concern is for the student who might have not yet signed up for <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5652.657s">reduced</a> price lunch or something, but all of a sudden there's a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5657.519s">And</a> I just wouldn't want them to be in any way signaled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5661.501s">This</a> is consistent, you say, with other school districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5664.823s">And</a> we have to have- We have to have a charge policy, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5667.604s">Well,</a> I'll be curious, yeah, what other people think about it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.032s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.373s">So</a> I think that having some threshold where the account is followed up on, that's not a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5983.619s">I</a> definitely think that all of a sudden the kid goes through the line and they get a different meal is a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5992.005s">I</a> would rather them still be able to take their regular meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5996.188s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6001.94s">I</a> mean, because it still shows up, and there's still, the follow-up would still be necessary, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6008.487s">Yes,</a> they would be in a negative capacity going through the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6012.091s">I</a> mean, it says here, I mean, because there's a punishment instated in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6016.215s">The</a> child will be allowed to take a meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6018.138s">And</a> that meal will be continued to be charged to the account at the standard lunch rate based on their meal benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6023.986s">So</a> if the meal is three and a quarter, even though they're getting a cheese sandwich rather than chicken nuggets, they're being charged the same three and a quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6031.597s">To</a> me, there is a punishment there, and I'm not comfortable with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6080.264s">So</a> I understand that it's important for us to have some thresholds so that parents are contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6086.408s">And</a> I understand that the alternative lunch is <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6090.616s">meets</a> the same criteria, but I'm not comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6093.499s">So</a> I'm comfortable with saying, OK, flag the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6100.265s">We</a> need to talk to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6102.267s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6103.268s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6104.188s">But</a> I'm not comfortable with changing the lunch for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6109.974s">That</a> just doesn't sit well with me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8720.623s">Yes,</a> I just want to thank Dr. Perella for being proactive on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8724.305s">I</a> think it's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8726.066s">I</a> mean, I remember when vaping was considered to be healthier than cigarette smoking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8732.83s">And</a> so the idea was that you were stepping down if you were vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8736.192s">And</a> clearly when you presented the last time and mentioned jeweling and the amount of nicotine, I was shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8742.276s">And</a> clearly this has taken on a new concern for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8746.779s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8747.56s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8932.341s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8933.641s">So</a> I've been thinking about this for the last couple of weeks and really wondering what to say to my esteemed colleagues who are leaving us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8944.966s">First,</a> I'm going to turn to Robert Emmett Scurry, who's been sitting next to me for an awfully long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8953.727s">We've</a> shared many different instances, but amongst our colleagues from the back, and some of these names won't mean anything to some of you, but some of them will mean a great deal to others. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8965.733s">So</a> we sat with Bill Brady, Lena DiGiantomaso, the esteemed Fred Pompeo, Mary Alabirdy, Carol Sharpton, Fred Lasky, Jack the Bulldog Buckley, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8982.359s">Ed</a> Nolan, Ron Vining, Beth Fuller, Sharon Guzik, Bill O'Keefe, the Honorable Mike McGlynn, and now our current colleagues, Erin, Mia, Kathy, Anne Marie, and of course, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9000.068s">I</a> don't know if I got everybody, but I think I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9004.29s">And</a> through that, we've had a lot of different experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9011.692s">With</a> Lena, we were climbing on roofs of buildings to check out the roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9018.055s">And</a> then we had many, many long evenings as we prepared for building new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9024.899s">And</a> I suspect, Bob, like me, your proudest moments come when you go see your name on those plaques in the new schools, because those were incredible, an incredible period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9037.457s">Bob,</a> you and I haven't always gotten along. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9040.317s">We're</a> not always on the same page, but I know and have never doubted that your heart is in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9047.719s">And</a> this position here and your commitment to Medford and to the students of Medford has meant everything to you and that you have given a great deal of time and energy to the city of Medford and the children of Medford and our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9062.461s">So</a> colleague.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9065.102s">Almost</a> four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9067.211s">Colleague,</a> I'm not quite sure what it's going to be like sitting here without you, and I'm going to miss you, but I know that you will take your time and commitment and energy working on behalf of students in Medford will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9081.118s">So</a> thank you very much for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9084.599s">Now,</a> Mrs. Cugno, you've not been here quite as long as Mr. Scurry, but your impact has been huge over the last, is it 12? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9093.053s">12</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9094.194s">And</a> in that time, we also got to see your family grow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9098.775s">And</a> that was pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9100.996s">So</a> because those boys, they were in elementary school way back when, and now they're in college or beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9107.178s">And</a> it's really been quite an amazing ride, Anne Marie, hasn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9115.957s">Don't</a> do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9120.88s">So</a> in that ride, one has to say, I mean, through all of the different things, of course, like with Mr. Scurry, the building of the new schools was just an amazing project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9130.825s">And</a> so many meetings, so many, so many meetings that we spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9136.879s">talking</a> about the bigger picture and then the small picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9140.021s">And</a> the small picture was the color of the paint, the location of the switches, and then the bigger issues of equity, which was so, so, so important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9153.632s">And</a> you were part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9154.592s">You</a> were a very big part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9156.874s">And</a> it fueled your becoming a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9163.718s">And</a> we were all grateful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9165.758s">You</a> went on, though, to be very active on the state level, first by becoming the head of the division two for the MASC, Massachusetts Association of School Committee, and then working your way up to an incredible year as being president of the MASC and representing Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9185.982s">I</a> quite honestly believe that, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9189.918s">Most</a> of my colleagues here don't really realize what you did during the course of that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9195.444s">But</a> I was fortunate to sit on the board with Anne-Marie and be able to experience her leadership and the amount of work and travel that it took over that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9207.436s">So</a> Anne-Marie, maybe, luckily, my voice is giving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9212.575s">So</a> I just want to thank you as a friend and as a colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9215.856s">Thank</a> you for your time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9217.476s">And</a> I know that you will be continuing to give your heart and your love to the city of Medford.

attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=211.896s">The</a> meeting was called to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=221.71s">It</a> was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=225.336s">I</a> just added that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=226.557s">Superintendent</a> Dawson made the following remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=229.998s">The</a> evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=234.48s">It</a> should be Bernadette Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=237.441s">So</a> we addressed the four different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=240.823s">And</a> the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=245.104s">Director</a> of Administration and Finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report and it's attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=251.306s">And</a> principal, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=253.427s">Tucci</a> verified the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=254.967s">There</a> are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, and in the afternoon, there are between 45 to 50 riders daily, which is within its capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=264.309s">At</a> this time, there's no need to add another bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=266.79s">Administration</a> will keep the committee informed as demand increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=270.751s">The</a> next item was student concussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=273.972s">We</a> talked about this at length. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=277.253s">As</a> part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=283.098s">She</a> asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=290.764s">She</a> believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=294.367s">Her</a> son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=297.35s">The</a> concern focused upon safety at away games. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=303.523s">Members</a> of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=312.61s">Mrs.</a> Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=320.837s">Concern</a> was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=326.942s">The</a> superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=332.366s">The</a> next item under discussion was the field trip policy, and Administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=343.072s">CPAC</a> Chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=352.658s">There</a> was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=360.226s">And</a> among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=374.9s">If</a> we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately 7,500 and would not have made the trip doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.205s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.385s">McLaughlin</a> asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=389.471s">The</a> issue raised several points. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=391.274s">Can</a> field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=396.681s">Should</a> field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=400.186s">And</a> should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=405.673s">After</a> continued discussion, the policy was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=407.795s">Administrators</a> will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=411.718s">The</a> final issue of the evening was school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=414.38s">Headmaster</a> Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=421.126s">The</a> headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=427.331s">Mr.</a> Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=431.654s">More</a> will be done going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=433.296s">This</a> is a work in progress, but it is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=436.059s">Mr.</a> Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=439.682s">He</a> revisited his concerns from last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=442.805s">Administrators</a> asserted that the changes would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=445.268s">The</a> school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=448.351s">The</a> meeting was adjourned at 10.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=450.153s">Respectfully</a> submitted, Paulette Vanderkoot, Secretary.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=578.258s">I</a> can give it to you afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=581.98s">I</a> guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=620.472s">And</a> if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=707.654s">Right,</a> but we do have the student who this happened to, and we could have a follow-up with the student.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1705.657s">okay</a> so we'll give you that we'll give you that report I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation yeah this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment for <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1725.543s">where</a> kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1728.906s">Do</a> you have any insight into that number?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1758.23s">And</a> the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1764.251s">There</a> was only one school where there was a slight decline and I'm just want to make sure that we we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1777.915s">That's</a> why I think the classroom is <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1780.095s">environment</a> really is ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1783.097s">And</a> if it works at the Columbus, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1836.309s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.508s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.688s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4507.968s">Penny,</a> last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4520.775s">And</a> one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4526.458s">They</a> were both students who had previously attended Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4531.081s">And</a> one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4536.866s">They</a> were, you know, were popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4539.948s">They</a> were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4548.755s">And</a> one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive foundation here, but I'm totally worried about that transition off to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4560.599s">And</a> I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4564.301s">And</a> we see these incredible stories of the Fratt brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4569.022s">who</a> are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4573.644s">And</a> that's where I'm wondering, our last, we're touching the kids at 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4580.047s">I</a> don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4587.33s">I'm</a> just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4592.132s">For</a> some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college and then all of a sudden they get there and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4622.034s">Also,</a> I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4627.277s">I</a> know that they both expressed willingness to me and others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4638.663s">I'm</a> sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4986.4s">Betty</a> can give you more stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4988.16s">Can</a> I follow up on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4989.921s">But</a> actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was, one jewel contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5001.703s">It's</a> just so striking that it is time for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5005.203s">We</a> have a graphics arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5006.524s">We</a> can get some posters made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5008.784s">I</a> think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5052.814s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5053.254s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5053.434s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5054.034s">Yes,</a> no, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the graphic arts department and get some posters made.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.299s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.98s">Christina,</a> I had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6018.762s">Could</a> you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6066.265s">Okay,</a> so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6975.568s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.249s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.429s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6977.61s">So</a> Mr. Texer, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7003.664s">Okay</a> so and at Medford high school say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7046.227s">The</a> other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7059.811s">How</a> is that working out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7068.397s">Well,</a> I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7088.533s">Okay,</a> so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7514.2s">uh...</a> i'm happy to take any any questions uh... thank you bernadette so of the uh... corrections and changes that you've made i've noted that all the ones that i particularly had brought up the taking care of that of course now being said is my eyes lit on another uh... <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7534.369s">which</a> I think we need to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7537.271s">So</a> if you give me a second so I can find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7540.472s">It</a> has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7546.474s">And</a> it is on page four, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7563.064s">And</a> I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7566.105s">I</a> think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7574.389s">So</a> that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7585.417s">But</a> we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7595.74s">We've</a> had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7599.161s">Those</a> things, there was no time to give six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7602.022s">It's</a> not realistic to have our policy say six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7606.464s">So</a> I think we need a sentence which say, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7610.665s">For</a> other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7625.649s">Using</a> as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the timeframe.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7631.63s">Yeah,</a> prior to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7633.17s">But</a> I mean, it has to be reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7634.731s">We</a> really don't like the last minute ones that, I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7640.692s">And</a> there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7677.392s">Well,</a> there is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7683.835s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7685.776s">But</a> again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7690.879s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.26s">Travel.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.94s">And</a> then the second sentence need to say other, I'm just trying to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7699.083s">Other</a> trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee within an appropriate time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7710.757s">I</a> think we're gonna need to leave it a little bit unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7715.782s">Unless</a> someone else has a better wording.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7752.06s">So</a> you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford School Committee prior to payment.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.215s">May</a> I ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.975s">You</a> have the samples ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7950.397s">Is</a> there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7955.722s">Is</a> it gonna hold anything up in terms of? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7958.905s">We</a> have an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7959.666s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7976.568s">Well,</a> Erin, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7979.67s">No,</a> Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7988.236s">I</a> just asked whether there was any problem with that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8453.262s">There's</a> a motion on the floor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8454.382s">Vanden</a> Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8455.083s">So</a> you're gonna kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8461.425s">And</a> you just said something, you said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were gonna go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money, and that has nothing to do with payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8478.23s">So</a> if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8492.061s">Payment</a> is not the word that you want there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8497.706s">So</a> this is page four, number three.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8538.86s">I</a> didn't suggest payment, someone else did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.32s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.941s">Okay,</a> and I suggested that what we were doing was saying that teacher was going out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8550.626s">I</a> think if there's an overnight trip, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8555.548s">within</a> the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8561.451s">Okay,</a> I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying, if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8578.832s">I</a> mean, that's that's how I would line it out now, because payment, I think, is I think payment is arbitrary.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8588.218s">So</a> just recently, we had the Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.14s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.62s">Come</a> to New York opportunities to go to New York.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8594.662s">Well,</a> that was being funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8595.803s">I</a> mean, someone else.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8647.43s">We</a> had a new administrator.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8657.335s">So</a> let me just ask the committee, if we're talking about foreign trips out of country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8672.103s">90</a> days, here it said six months.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.1s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.401s">So</a> I think you should do three months, because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8725.043s">If</a> you're saying just a general blanket, and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8767.152s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8768.954s">Mrs.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8772.093s">All</a> right, Mrs. Cress. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8773.856s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8774.377s">Mrs.</a> Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8776.019s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8776.119s">Mr.</a> Scurry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8777.581s">Mrs.</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8778.262s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8778.642s">Mayor</a> Burke.<h2><a href="../2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s/2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 20, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1146.98s">Miss</a> Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1148.521s">So</a> is this then do we need to go before the City Council to ask for this match?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1155.847s">And</a> would this be part of a capital improvement plan or would this be a standalone item?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1163.052s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1163.592s">And</a> so we need to move on this relatively quickly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1167.715s">So</a> I'd make a motion for approval because obviously anything that we can do to improve our infrastructure <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1174.387s">is</a> absolutely worth doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1176.35s">And</a> so I make a motion to approve and to send this forward to the city council for their approval.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1767.933s">So</a> my question was, it's a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1773.414s">I'm</a> sure we're going to be very conscientious of making sure that we have lunches for all kids, no matter what their allergies might be or something like that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1785.457s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1785.817s">And</a> the second question I had to do had to do with <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1789.218s">In</a> the report, it said, as discussed, signs signifying Stop and Shop's donation will be placed inside the bistro, and we will receive content, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1796.882s">photos,</a> for marketing and media relations purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1800.063s">So</a> I just wondered what exactly the, I could certainly see other people approaching other <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1809.122s">food</a> stores for donations as well or for assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1813.184s">And</a> so I just want to make sure that because Stop and Shop has their sign that it is open to other perhaps generous givers in the future.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1842.222s">OK,</a> thank you, Chris.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2117.153s">I</a> just had a question about the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2119.054s">Is</a> this a Bus that a private bus for these no, it's not a private bus.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2131.003s">I</a> figured for the price it had to be but I just want yes I hope you guys have a wonderful time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2135.166s">I</a> wish I was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2135.846s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2522.65s">So</a> it's a motion of approval, sort of in retrospect. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2526.513s">But</a> it's a great thing, and we know that it's wonderful for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2529.355s">I'm</a> certainly glad that they're going, and I look forward to hearing from them on their return.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3997.846s">So</a> Roy, we knew this day would come, but it doesn't make the coming any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4002.488s">You've</a> been an exceptional leader for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4005.35s">Your</a> commitment and dedication is simply, it can't be, it's unparalleled. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4012.954s">I've</a> been on the school committee for a long time, so I've known and been able to work with you for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4018.036s">And</a> I have to tell you, the number of nights that I found you in your office <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4023.82s">night</a> after night after night, ready to respond to any question, ready to be there, is just unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4033.446s">And</a> also, as a school committee, we can get to pick up the phone and call the superintendent, and it didn't matter was it weekend, it didn't matter whether he was on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4043.611s">And</a> so some of us have talked to him when he was on vacation, and he was always there ready to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4053.597s">I</a> think of your great compassion to staff members who were under duress as something that was truly, you know, always unsung. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4062.881s">It</a> was always below the level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4064.442s">But</a> when we had a staff member who was going through some crisis, Roy was always there and compassionate for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4070.445s">His</a> dedication to our students and the whole child approach, I think on some of these things, you led the pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4076.227s">Early</a> childhood education, the Medford Family Network, so important in our world. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4082.925s">No</a> superintendent can be everything to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4086.887s">Yep,</a> superintendents piss people off sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4089.989s">They</a> say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4090.869s">And</a> you've done that, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4092.51s">And</a> I know that there have been people who've not always been enthusiastic about your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4098.133s">But</a> I, for one, as someone who has sat and worked with you, who've been on many different committees and worked with you, can only say that you have been a remarkable leader for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4108.359s">Your</a> work ethic is just the tops, and you have <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4113.001s">Your</a> dedication to Medford has been absolutely exemplary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4117.205s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2017-10-04_YlxkC9ZcZAw/2017-10-04_YlxkC9ZcZAw.html">Medford School Committee meeting Monday, October 2, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=237.187s">I</a> just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=250.219s">And</a> I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=255.785s">And</a> so I've noticed there were a lot that came in, probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent, and that's the line item you're seeing, but I have looked at every single one.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=620.723s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=620.803s">Vanden</a> Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=621.603s">Yes,</a> the only thing is, of course, some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college, so there is a timeliness issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=628.809s">And</a> I, too, have a different recollection than what's here, because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=642.039s">kids'</a> GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=650.441s">It</a> says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=656.522s">I</a> was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=661.963s">Mr.</a> Superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=680.346s">So</a> I would like to lay the paper on the table.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1541.501s">I</a> just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teacher's reaction was that he felt demonized and less so. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1549.985s">I</a> felt very, very sad because that was certainly, I don't think, our intention as school committee members or maybe even the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1563.431s">The</a> reality was that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1567.134s">gotten</a> a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1577.633s">And</a> this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1583.234s">I</a> still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1595.356s">And</a> for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1607.238s">We</a> want to keep class sizes reasonable, and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits, nor would we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1616.429s">So,</a> this issue of friends, and how do we, how do we, <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1622.836s">tackle</a> this issue so that we don't have an imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1626.418s">I</a> have been to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1628.119s">I</a> think you guys are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1629.68s">I've</a> had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1635.924s">I</a> certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1639.847s">And</a> because I have history, as many of us do here, we know <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1645.17s">that</a> there has been sometimes where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1654.515s">From</a> a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1661.438s">good</a> about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1671.682s">That's</a> why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1687.008s">I</a> know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1691.731s">Once</a> the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1694.993s">But</a> the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1698.915s">Anyway,</a> thank you so much for coming down and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2098.967s">I'd</a> say clearly you guys did a great job.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2580.25s">I</a> just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2582.892s">I</a> think we need to keep something in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2586.215s">Up</a> to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2595.743s">The</a> school committee members have been to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2598.565s">We</a> know many, many of the faces that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2601.467s">We've</a> gone to many different events. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2603.649s">We</a> celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2607.932s">It</a> is wrong to say that we didn't know that with 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2620.241s">Is</a> there a perception because <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2622.883s">of</a> that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2635.65s">Those</a> students are great students. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2637.811s">I</a> know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2641.012s">But</a> you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2646.375s">So</a> I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2652.281s">We</a> need to keep this into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2655.825s">We've</a> had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2662.849s">This</a> year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2673.375s">Because</a> all of a sudden we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2679.678s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2680.439s">Nobody</a> called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2681.981s">Not</a> one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2689.61s">Not</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2691.333s">What</a> I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2699.385s">And</a> it's that how do we block up then? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2701.466s">How</a> do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2707.968s">That's</a> what I've heard over and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2711.41s">That's</a> why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2720.973s">So</a> I just, I need to keep it in perspective, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2724.577s">I</a> need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2728.22s">I</a> appreciate the teachers coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2730.983s">I</a> need you to remember where this came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2733.665s">And</a> that's the problem we were trying to solve.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4198.313s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4198.513s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4199.554s">I</a> just really wanted to congratulate you on working so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4203.698s">I</a> remember so many times seeing you gathering signatures to make sure that this would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4209.723s">And</a> now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4214.346s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4214.846s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4217.028s">I'll</a> go along with the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4218.429s">That's</a> a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4220.59s">I'd</a> also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open, creative playgrounds for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4227.274s">And</a> I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4232.317s">the</a> creative space opportunity, which is decidedly different area than a conventional playground would be a very interesting thing to pursue.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4245.467s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4953.274s">I</a> just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop, who is selling 02155 gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4958.899s">And</a> because they're going to plan, they are planning a trip to Europe. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4962.681s">And</a> I just really want to support their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4966.384s">And</a> it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4967.866s">I</a> wish I had brought mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4968.606s">I</a> meant to, and I forgot it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4969.627s">The</a> bracelet?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4971.909s">No,</a> the hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4972.869s">The</a> hat, shirts.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5168.445s">We</a> also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips, and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5772.519s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5772.679s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5774.02s">I</a> wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2014-15 school year, there were 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5785.145s">and</a> then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5788.567s">So</a> we're going in the wrong direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5790.388s">But</a> maybe that's a better identification.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5794.991s">The</a> second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5814.051s">I</a> guess I'd like to trace it, too, because that's a concern if the kid has, you know, plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse and, you know, we're making, it's also across the board, not just sport by sport.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5895.977s">I</a> had one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5898.178s">So</a> I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6294.752s">VanderKloof,</a> did that happen <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6298.892s">Once,</a> was it a one time incident, or was it, it was when? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6304.814s">Multiple.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6305.375s">Multiple</a> times. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6305.915s">It</a> was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6308.856s">They</a> did not realize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6309.556s">They</a> didn't realize it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6326.143s">But</a> we should be posting it, and now we know.<h2><a href="../2017-09-20_gXzvDPklqhM/2017-09-20_gXzvDPklqhM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 18, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=11.201s">Mrs.</a> Kress. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=11.982s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=12.803s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=13.003s">Mestone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=13.684s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=14.324s">Mr.</a> Scurry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=36.845s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=38.066s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=38.286s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=39.146s">I'd</a> like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member, but our student representative, Sebastian Tringali, with us today.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=898.525s">So</a> please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=908.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=909.369s">It</a> would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=912.15s">The</a> superintendent wouldn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=914.21s">there</a> would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=915.791s">So</a> clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=929.84s">But</a> they were in North Andover last year, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.569s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.749s">Van</a> der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1402.137s">The</a> one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1442.433s">So</a> on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1447.939s">So</a> the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1969.748s">So</a> I move that the party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1980.198s">Seconded.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3037.025s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3037.225s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3038.185s">I</a> have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3039.405s">The</a> first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3051.689s">There</a> were lots of discrepancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3054.71s">And</a> I know that's a very timely thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3056.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3057.071s">Was</a> the information that you received so far this year more accurate?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3084.508s">But</a> I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3088.97s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3090.731s">The</a> second question has to do with the participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3094.054s">Are</a> we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3114.012s">But</a> we know who took the test and who didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3115.853s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3116.553s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3428.046s">So</a> as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3448.582s">Traditionally</a> it goes to the curriculum committee.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3709.581s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3711.483s">Motion</a> to accept and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3714.147s">And</a> thank you, Bernadette.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3940.637s">I</a> think that's such a great addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3942.499s">I</a> also, though, just need to take a moment to thank my colleague, Anne Marie Cuno, who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3952.365s">It's</a> been a long time of great successes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3974.944s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3975.324s">And</a> you do a great job, Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3976.765s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.068s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.248s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5178.649s">Beverly,</a> one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5187.694s">And</a> you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5193.457s">But</a> it was more than that, because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5203.402s">I'm</a> hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5223.42s">This</a> was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5235.837s">We</a> knew that... No, not in terms of that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5316.469s">Like,</a> I see that it says that we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5324.853s">And</a> the thing is, I think we need to do that right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5327.794s">I</a> want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5382.165s">I</a> think we usually plan for stipends to take place.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5634.822s">I'm</a> racist So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5720.558s">But</a> not to this level.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6138.347s">So</a> when we did it, it was very unpopular. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6142.509s">And</a> there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6146.492s">One</a> of the things which now is I hear so many positive things about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6166.723s">So</a> I just haven't heard that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6172.329s">The</a> ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6177.734s">I</a> mean, really positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6179.395s">And</a> Mia, you nearly took my breath away when you said, why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6184.28s">Well,</a> that might be something we're going to talk about, but we're going to make <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6187.943s">A</a> lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6194.412s">It's</a> a very difficult thing as a school committee member, because we are naturally people who want to please. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6200.717s">And</a> unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're going to not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6207.623s">So</a> what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6216.792s">And</a> how are we making sure? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6218.093s">And</a> one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6222.697s">that</a> they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a... because we were so concerned at the time of building them that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6242.041s">This</a> is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6249.503s">We've</a> never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6256.144s">But</a> we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6259.605s">And</a> in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6545.425s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6546.165s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6546.946s">I</a> think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6552.409s">The</a> teacher is extraordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6553.989s">She</a> does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6558.832s">I</a> don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by- She had a hundred last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6564.733s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6565.213s">So</a> either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she told us to do it at the other school as well, or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6579.076s">Because</a> to just say, okay, every student, if I understand the student that you're talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6586.358s">But</a> frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're going to have 25 calls of kids who hear this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6597.754s">So</a> perhaps we have to think about running a drama program.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6749.714s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6750.475s">I</a> just had one more question, a little bit back to earlier in your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6754.498s">You</a> mentioned to us the teacher changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6757.2s">And</a> I'm wondering if that's because are the teachers willing to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6764.606s">Are</a> we going to see grievances at some point? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6768.129s">I</a> just wondered.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6881.958s">I</a> understand, I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6887.299s">I</a> mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6931.725s">Okay,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6933.046s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7638.287s">So</a> we didn't spend enough money? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7640.527s">Oh</a> no.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8090.03s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8090.17s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8090.93s">Christine,</a> I just want to thank you for your diligence in sorting out all of these accounts, and this is good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8096.232s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8096.952s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=944.304s">There</a> is a saying which says that the devil is in the details and I sort of feel like that's part of what our discussion about the vocational school and the <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=955.23s">the</a> changes we had this summer, because while I'm having a feeling that perhaps the administration, it was all perfectly clear to them, all of these details, from the school committee perspective, as I had expressed to the superintendent, once I learned of some of the changes, was not clear at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=976.3s">For</a> example, I was not clear that all of a sudden, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=980.902s">guidance</a> Councilor would no longer sit in that particular office over on their side, or that the kids would not have an assistant principal with them in the course of where those SHOP programs are held. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=996.578s">Maybe</a> there's a good rationale behind a lot of the different changes, but quite honestly, I don't understand all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1003.403s">And</a> I think, I mean, as every, my colleagues have said, it's important for us to understand it in order to embrace them or to say, hey, wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1011.325s">does</a> that really need to be and how do we maintain that identity for the vocational program, which I'll say the vocational program, because it's important that we have that identity held strong so that in the future, not only are they Mighty Mustangs, but they're members of the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1031.909s">I</a> think it's possible to be both in a very positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1035.809s">So</a> I look forward to the follow-up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1038.27s">I</a> certainly have a lot of questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1040.89s">And</a> when I say that, I don't want to take away from the work that was done by so many in being able to bring some of the walls down, because there was a lot of work, and there are a lot of advantages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1052.901s">And</a> so we want to go forward being able to take advantage of all those positive things, but also really looking back and saying, wait a second, is that what we thought, and how does that work?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1329.819s">There's</a> none.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1476.487s">I</a> think we had a request.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2113.39s">Is</a> there no other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2114.85s">I</a> just have a housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2117.071s">I</a> didn't receive, attach the, I received one page of new hires, but not the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2122.573s">So</a> I don't know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2131.378s">And</a> then if we could take up that issue again about the Andrews-McGlynn when we're under enrollment.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2524.358s">I</a> just want to say thank you to both people and Mrs. Lasky for organizing the new teacher induction and the administrative meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2534.244s">I</a> had the opportunity to come up to the high school and say hello to the new teachers and of course they all look so young.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3073.858s">Yes,</a> my question, I heard something about there will be an action report, and I think that's in relation to the discrepancy of enrollment between the Andrews and McGlynn, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3085.783s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3086.604s">Okay,</a> and when are we to expect that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3093.377s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3094.417s">And</a> the biggest concern I have right at the moment, I think that there's a long term and a short term, but clearly we heard from some parents of students who did not get their first choice school and were very upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3110.023s">And</a> I just wanted to make sure that we follow those kids and make sure that their acclimation to the new school is in fact going well and they're not being adversely impacted.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3148.152s">Excuse</a> me, I read my packet thoroughly and I don't, did you just give us an action report?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3157.079s">Well,</a> maybe it's in someone's, but it's not in mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3160.001s">I</a> have the Yoki, I have the purple paper, I have the executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3165.104s">I</a> do not have that paper.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3167.386s">No</a> wonder, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3169.648s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3170.068s">I</a> still don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3171.308s">So</a> now I do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3193.245s">So</a> maybe perhaps we could put it on the agenda for follow-up at our next meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3204.868s">If</a> we have questions about it, I'd like to put it on the agenda, please.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3708.157s">John,</a> in your report, you attached information from an inspection from the plaster in this auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3715.247s">And</a> it's difficult for us to see because the lights are in our eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3719.693s">I</a> noted that you said that we made ceiling repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3722.517s">So</a> are the ceiling repairs consistent? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3724.939s">with</a> the recommendations in the report, and did we have our guys do that, or did we have professionals come in?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3738.688s">We</a> can't tell anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3739.808s">Right</a> above us, actually.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3747.373s">So</a> all of those were taken care of?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3764.006s">And</a> I guess the key part of that is besides the repair work, it sounded like any issues that allowed water in that might have caused this are taken care of.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5567.867s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5569.968s">I</a> would just like to say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5571.369s">I</a> don't know whether, and this obviously is totally up to you, because you're certainly free to make any statement you want to us, whether you want to make a public statement or you want to talk to our Attorney General directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5582.373s">So</a> I just want to put that out as to whether this is an issue you want aired publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5591.596s">I</a> just wanted to make sure.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6100.125s">That</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6105.868s">Mr.</a> Greenspan, does the school committee have the right to direct the superintendent to enroll the students or would that be in contempt of court?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6124.742s">I</a> haven't seen the document.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6128.364s">I</a> mean, this is a really difficult issue for us because I think that we have great sympathy and we certainly want to get the kids to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6135.627s">Frankly,</a> wherever they're going to school, we want those kids to be enrolled in school and resume their normal education path. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6142.91s">As</a> a one school committee member, I feel great sympathy, but I don't think this is in my purview as much as I might want it to be.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6656.887s">May</a> I follow up?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6658.549s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6659.611s">I</a> don't really... My feeling, too, is that I understand you're saying we may not have the standing, but if we don't at least try. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6666.821s">Obviously,</a> it's in the best interest of the students, of the children, that we make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6674.186s">And</a> so, I would at least want to petition them, even if it's for a temporary placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6679.69s">So,</a> could we ask you to do that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7789.291s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7789.451s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7791.12s">I</a> appreciate your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7792.608s">Dr.</a> Perillo, I have to say the only thing which is just, well, I have two different things that's just gnawing at me, and I'll vote to go along with this, but the other day I overheard a conversation between two parents, and one of them said, my son has already called or texted me six times, and it was only 10.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7812.651s">And</a> she said, I wish they wouldn't allow this, because it was clearly, where is that separation between child and parent? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7820.313s">And</a> I see that as a growing, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7822.508s">concern,</a> we talk about helicopter parents, we talk about, you know, kids, they're just, the advent of this ease in 24-7 technology has also meant for some kids not being as, gaining their independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7839.31s">And</a> so I <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7840.871s">And</a> at my workplace where I supervise high school students, I know that there's been a real issue where it's been very difficult to say, nope, you can't use those cell phones when you're, oh yeah, pushing a patient or taking them, you know, and having to make strict lines, especially because there's other than employees walking through the halls on their cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7863.566s">And,</a> you know, when you're in the kind of environment where I work, we need to impress upon <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7870.6s">our</a> students what's appropriate and they're just so used to having ready access that when that cell phone buzzes, they're thinking they can be there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7939.933s">Yep,</a> that shouldn't be the whole focus of your day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7943.256s">So</a> motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7944.778s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8098.317s">Dr.</a> Perla, while you're here, I'm just going to take this opportunity to mention that the school committee has been without a student representative for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8106.944s">Over</a> the course of years, occasionally we've had some students that we've done better or worse, but now for the last <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8113.81s">last</a> two years or more, we haven't had anybody, and certainly nobody consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8119.251s">I</a> think it's valuable when we get to a question like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8122.152s">This</a> is when, while you've done an excellent job defending your position and explaining to us the rationale, which I certainly appreciate, but this is so much a question when we should have our student representatives present. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8138.315s">So</a> I'm wondering if we could ask you to <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8141.863s">explain</a> to the students what the role is, explain that this is an opportunity for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8146.565s">We've</a> had some great, you know, vocal people in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8151.187s">We</a> like hearing from the kids, and I'm wondering if you could help arrange that so that we could expect to have students on a regular basis attend our meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8164.819s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10829.637s">Van</a> de Koot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10831.838s">I</a> had a couple of first nuts and bolts questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10835.099s">You</a> listed in your report Curtis liabilities and one of them was notification of rights and suggested that this could be easily resolved by adding a message to the school brains login screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10847.545s">Has</a> that been done?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10856.107s">It's</a> very easy to... Then it would just seem that we should try and take these liabilities off. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10861.516s">Another</a> one was the current ad hoc method of assigning user security roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10865.361s">is</a> unsustainable and may expose sensitive information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10871.927s">So</a> I would think that that would be another one that we would need to spend some time on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10877.631s">The</a> data storage, I understand, being an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10881.454s">So</a> those are kind of nuts and bolts issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10883.075s">Since</a> you've identified them, I'd like to try and resolve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10886.434s">The</a> bigger issue that is also brought up in this report is the whole GPA system and the weighting of courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10893.76s">And</a> I think that's a much larger conversation than certainly any of us have the wherewithal tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10900.565s">I</a> think that should probably happen within the course of meetings and probably in the curriculum subcommittee, perhaps, if my colleagues thought so as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10911.463s">I</a> think that there's a lot of input we need to get and a lot of information for all of those questions which were presented to us, really saying is that the best possible way to go in the future to determine student achievement and how we emphasize that, how we tell schools, colleges, when kids are applying, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10933.732s">what</a> sort of student this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10935.372s">It</a> also goes on and says, you know, how do we give out awards and is it based on GPA or is it based on other stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10941.734s">So</a> a lot of information in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10944.054s">And</a> something that I would suggest that we send to the curriculum subcommittee, which is my subcommittee, and ponder and work on that over some period of time this year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11372.88s">I</a> just have a question that I'd like to throw out.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11395.486s">Since</a> we're talking about next week's meeting, I have to tell you as one committee member, this has not been an ideal setup for me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11405.029s">It's</a> very difficult to feel like I'm having a conversation with my fellow school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11410.47s">The</a> lights are in our eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11412.694s">We</a> only sort of see the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11415.658s">And</a> I'm not sure whether the television was capturing the speakers who came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11422.128s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11423.089s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11427.135s">Oh,</a> good.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11429.976s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11430.677s">The</a> only problem is that as a body who is interacting with my colleagues, frankly, it's very disconcerting to be trying to have a discussion in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11441.561s">So</a> I'd like some thought put into this next week.<h2><a href="../2017-05-22_69E5Q7WOK_c/2017-05-22_69E5Q7WOK_c.html">Medford School Committee meeting replay from May 15, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3998.877s">I</a> noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4004.06s">And</a> one, we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4008.094s">broadcasts</a> on TV publicly, so I just want to read it for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4012.275s">Meeting</a> with Attorney General clarified the B-1, B-2 enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4016.997s">Schools</a> are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4021.598s">Therefore,</a> our schools do not have to remove any existing B-1, B-2 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4026.159s">This</a> was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4033.961s">Also,</a> as a question on... <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4036.286s">see</a> that there was discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4043.712s">And</a> I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those appointments yet.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4053.199s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4065.959s">We</a> did a motion, yeah.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6076.214s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6079.597s">I</a> just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6085.922s">For</a> students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6092.987s">Do</a> we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6132.949s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6177.412s">Whenever</a> we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Ann Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6185.615s">So,</a> just want to mention that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6229.466s">No,</a> I just noticed that in the form, it says that the summer fund program runs 7.30 PM to 4.30 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6236.631s">It</a> just needs to be corrected.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1582.826s">I</a> just think that it's important that we note that the different sorts of things that the money is being spent on, including <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1590.141s">five</a> foot wide concrete sidewalk and granite curbs, including ramps, pavement mill and overlay, signs and striping, landscaping, drainage, utility improvements, school zone, flasher, traffic control. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1603.525s">And</a> these are the sorts of needed improvements that will make our city safer for walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1609.847s">So</a> this is really fantastic, and thank you so much.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1973.318s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1974.32s">Anyway,</a> I think it'll be interesting when you compare notes after the trips to see how it worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1979.427s">And</a> how many students do you have participating?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1983.994s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1984.295s">And</a> you have?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1986.438s">It</a> doesn't make sense to combine them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1991.032s">I</a> mean, obviously not this year.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2014.086s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2014.467s">I'm</a> not meaning this year at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2015.908s">I'm</a> just, and I think that there were pros and cons, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2020.18s">The</a> question needs to be asked.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2072.439s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2072.839s">Anyway,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2073.459s">Thanks</a> very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2074.1s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2942.022s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2942.222s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2943.043s">Yes,</a> I just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2944.524s">We</a> have the list of where they are in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2946.907s">I'm</a> just sort of curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2947.847s">Is</a> there one in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2949.269s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2949.829s">Right</a> in the front lobby. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2950.93s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2951.671s">Just</a> in case, because sometimes passions get pretty heated here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5394.457s">I</a> just wanted to mention that I really love that after the AP exams, the students are going to go down to Kids' Corner and teach them some <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5401.923s">some</a> words and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5403.043s">I</a> thought that was a lot of fun.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6063.355s">So</a> if you have any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6065.316s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6066.197s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6066.437s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6067.598s">Could</a> I just ask, what was the date of the pathways?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6082.329s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6082.589s">There's</a> so many things that night.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6085.171s">And</a> that one didn't get on our list. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6086.572s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6087.793s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6089.491s">I</a> guess one other comment, I just wanted to, I really like that there's been so much interaction between our students and Tufts and many of the other MIT and whatever so that our students are seeing real world potential jobs in mathematics and what people do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6107.548s">So</a> I think that clearly your report listed so many of them and I think that's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6111.972s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6272.482s">10th</a> is canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6273.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6273.9s">And</a> that's rescheduled to April 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6276.943s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6277.684s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6278.484s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6279.605s">I</a> did wonder, when we were given the school council reports, my colleague earlier asked about the PTO representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6287.172s">And</a> I wondered if we might combine those two, because often the school council reports reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6293.758s">We</a> can.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6305.285s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6305.685s">Sometimes</a> we hear about them.<h2><a href="../2017-03-07_J5xdcQvg5bk/2017-03-07_J5xdcQvg5bk.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 6, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=261.873s">the</a> conference room. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=262.917s">Professor</a> Carter, Ann Marie O'Neill, or individuals at SFS, me and the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=271.114s">President</a> Superintendent Roy Belson, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Vocational Principal Director Heidi Riccio, Director of Finance and Administration Christine Patterson, and Director of Buildings and Grounds John McLaughlin, parents Sarah O'Grady, Melissa McGinnis, Carolyn Montello, and Michelle Ciccolo, all rose to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=294.71s">Vice</a> Chair Cunha stated the purpose of the meeting was to continue our discussions on capital planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=299.96s">projects</a> for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=302.402s">Vice</a> Chair Cugno called upon the superintendent to begin the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=306.685s">The</a> superintendent reiterated the importance of understanding the difference between capital planning projects and general repair and maintenance issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=314.551s">Capital</a> planning is usually a multi-year group of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=317.837s">Such</a> projects generally require a mix of bonding, grants, and revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=322.084s">The</a> superintendent listed the capital projects that have been completed since FY 2000, which are attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=328.173s">Secretary</a> Van der Kloot pointed out that the pool and the boiler project should be added to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=332.812s">The</a> superintendent stressed the importance of getting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=335.314s">Capital</a> projects often take multiple years to get approval from the funding agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=340.039s">Additionally,</a> there are many non-school projects that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=343.342s">There</a> must be a balance between city and school priorities as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=347.026s">Mayor</a> Burke joined the meeting and assumed the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=348.988s">The</a> mayor was attending a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=353.986s">Each</a> committee member was provided with a packet of materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=356.669s">The</a> superintendent identified capital plan proposed on August 5th, 2016 for the committee's reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=363.877s">This</a> discussion then reviewed the statement of interest, which was approved by the school committee at their last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=369.951s">This</a> is only the first step toward acquiring MSBA funding assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=374.754s">Dr.</a> Heidi Riccio then detailed three grant awards that are moving forward to enable major improvements in program development. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=381.278s">They</a> are attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=382.239s">The</a> three grants are the Massachusetts Life Sciences Grant for $98,516, which will support the development of our robotics and engineering programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=391.993s">Number</a> two was the capital skills grant for $500,000 to support the development of our culinary and hospitality program. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=399.118s">We</a> will match this funding with both in-kind assistance from our partners in industry and labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=404.222s">Also,</a> we will use funding that is in the reserve contingency from the science labs project. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=409.005s">This</a> will require council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=410.987s">Third</a> is regional services grant for $200,000 to expand our shops to accommodate enrollment increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=418.312s">The</a> focus of this grant will be <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=420.493s">on</a> our electrical program and related areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=422.894s">It</a> will facilitate the inclusion with students from Everett who will pay a tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=428.076s">Currently,</a> we have 25 Everett students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=430.397s">We</a> expect to increase the number of tuition students to 100 over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=434.379s">We</a> are also recapturing tuitions from Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=437.66s">The</a> grants will be supplemented by in-kind work by the laborers and Wynn, as well as the other industry partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=443.242s">The</a> development of our shop spaces will also enable us to serve adult learners and to maximize the use of our facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=450.11s">The</a> laborers will also help increase handicap accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=453.794s">The</a> discussion moved to the high school roof, see infrared roof survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=457.998s">The</a> high school roof needs some small repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=460.333s">that</a> could be accomplished for about $25,000 to $30,000 this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=464.277s">We</a> would expect to consider roof replacement beginning with 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=467.019s">This</a> would be done in sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=469.862s">The</a> outside schools are still in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=472.084s">They</a> have another 10 years before possible replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=474.807s">Mr.</a> McLaughlin was present to ask your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=477.629s">Mr.</a> McLaughlin then discussed the emergency repairs to the heating system pipes in A building. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=483.355s">which</a> is attached, a financial account was provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=486.478s">Member</a> Mia Mastone asked how we could find funding for this type of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=491.302s">Also</a> why we are not finding money for building appearance projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=494.926s">The</a> superintendent explained that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=496.635s">he</a> would have had to shut down a building if the repairs were not made. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=500.316s">It</a> is not uncommon to divert funding for emergency repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=504.957s">He</a> also reiterated his plan to add additional funds to the operational budget next year for general repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=511.779s">Member</a> Erinda Benedetto asked that the hanging wires in the conference room be removed from sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=516.7s">Mr.</a> Scurry urged more cosmetic work be done, and members Cugno and Van der Kloot recognized the need to do more with appearance, but supported the priority of emergency repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=527.08s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=527.28s">Van</a> der Kloot asked for a report on the bleachers at our K-8 schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=531.242s">The</a> superintendent referenced the report from Mr. McLaughlin regarding the need to repair air conditioning compressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=536.685s">While</a> the schools are functional, there could be better efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=540.667s">There's</a> also an attached listing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=542.849s">Curb</a> replacement and parking lot resurfing was discussed with emphasis on the high school McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=548.291s">A</a> report is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=549.875s">Playground</a> replacement at the elementary schools was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=553.216s">Pricing</a> is now being sought. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=554.776s">There</a> is some possible mitigation linkage from a developer to assist with the Roberts playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=560.437s">The</a> committee received the draft executive summary for our school technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=564.698s">As</a> we move forward, technology is central to our educational and operational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=569.278s">Testing,</a> state, federal funding, reporting, and instruction are more and more dependent on a robust and reliable technology, sorry, infrastructure and tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=580.318s">We</a> are eligible for substantial funding from the e-rate program under Tier 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=584.9s">This</a> will require a 40% match. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=587.101s">Technology</a> capital investment must be an essential part of our capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=593.024s">Almost</a> made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=593.965s">On</a> the motion of Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=595.625s">Cugno,</a> the meeting was adjourned at 8.55 p.m.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1071.778s">I've</a> asked the students if they could just stay up here so perhaps we could do a photo. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1078.584s">The</a> other thing that I would like to do is I would like to put forth a resolution that the Medford Public Schools pay for our students to attend the competition in North Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1090.653s">And</a> if Mr. Eisner is willing, we certainly would certainly appreciate his accompanying our team in doing whatever we can do, because I am so, so proud of you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1154.954s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1587.361s">We</a> all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1592.165s">She</a> was a remarkable woman, both in her life and also as she was approaching the end of her life, and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1601.113s">This</a> is very fitting, and I'm thankful to her husband, Thomas, for making this a lasting tribute to her on our school grounds, which she loves so dearly.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1836.138s">Beverly,</a> I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1842.944s">So</a> I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1847.548s">I</a> would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1859.079s">So</a> I'd like the superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1884.656s">Yes,</a> I guess I'm looking at it a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1886.497s">If</a> I'm a parent thinking about making plans, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1890.282s">If</a> you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1896.385s">If</a> you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1906.49s">I'd</a> like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1913.814s">to</a> two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1918.835s">I</a> think it's an expectation thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1921.676s">What</a> do others think?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.097s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.517s">If</a> we just did some further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1951.798s">Okay,</a> fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2068.727s">So</a> we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2072.249s">And</a> in fact, many families preferred it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2074.27s">Um,</a> and certainly the teachers did. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2076.031s">The</a> fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2080.748s">too</a> far into June because we were getting more snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2083.23s">We</a> went through a period of years where we're getting a lot of snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2086.473s">And</a> so with the cooperation of the teachers union, we then moved it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2091.937s">Is</a> it preferable? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2092.918s">Well,</a> not necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2094.259s">It</a> depends on who you talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2095.34s">But</a> it's because of, I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2101.105s">And</a> if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2108.811s">So</a> that's why.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3057.803s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3059.624s">Also,</a> if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3093.313s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4230.882s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4231.062s">Van</a> der Klooten. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4232.403s">I'm</a> not quite sure what you said in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4234.585s">So</a> a freshman can't take art and band together?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4291.313s">So</a> is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4297.016s">So</a> if they wanted to take <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4298.747s">So</a> if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4303.29s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4314.896s">And</a> the pro of this is? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4316.077s">I</a> mean, the advantage?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.122s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.482s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4328.289s">The</a> opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4336.78s">So</a> there's pros and cons.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4366.562s">Um,</a> will they get graded in that CTE exploration?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4374.743s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5075.82s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5079.862s">I</a> know you're saying you're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5082.184s">I</a> was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5086.366s">And</a> at that point, there was no school nurse present. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5088.767s">There</a> was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5095.665s">So</a> that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5125.826s">Mr.</a> Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5130.589s">I'm</a> thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.<h2><a href="../2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA/2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 23, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=350.55s">Yes,</a> I would urge the superintendent as he considers this not to choose the third option all students proportionately share in the cost which was what was originally presented to us last week in reference to when the band trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=367.022s">To</a> me it just felt like that by doing it that way it could make students feel like their trip was more expensive because one of their <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=376.948s">fellow</a> students needed a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=379.57s">Instead</a> I think that it would be much better for either us for us to decide that on whatever field trip there was a uniform every student puts 25 bucks into the kitty or whatever I mean just so that it was a uniform <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=393.64s">a</a> cost to help offset the district's cost because option number one is the school system pays for the cost outright and that of course would be my choice but I'm also understanding that it is there's an expense and it could so by having some <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=412.948s">amount</a> of money, but it would be uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=414.971s">So</a> it wouldn't be for just one field trip or the other would be across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=418.896s">Every</a> time there's a field trip, every student would have as part of the cost, a small charge.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=440.098s">So</a> the idea of having the kitty, if you would, would be so that money would be thrown into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=447.222s">to</a> help offset the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=450.064s">And</a> it would be proportionate to, let's say it's a, if a, you know, $5 a day or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=456.709s">I'm</a> just speaking off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=458.351s">So</a> if it was a five-day field trip to Florida, the kids might put in 25 bucks.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=488.998s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=489.818s">So</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=490.899s">I'm</a> recognizing that, and I'm also proposing a way to help offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=494.482s">And</a> I certainly think that we're smart enough to come up with a way to do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=524.169s">If</a> I could follow up, are you saying that if there's a field trip, let's suppose we're having two field trips as we are this year going to, or next year, Disney. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=533.05s">So</a> on one there's a student who has medical needs and needs a nurse, but on the other one there are no students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=540.432s">So,</a> in that case, what you're saying is that group of kids where the parent is having, where there's medical needs for one student have to share that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=550.739s">But</a> that other group of students, just because they happen to have none. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=555.141s">So,</a> in my mind, I would rather say, hey, let's develop a policy where everybody kicks something in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=561.265s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=562.106s">Everybody</a> would benefit if there was a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=564.588s">Everybody</a> would, I mean, I just think it's more equitable and I think it takes away the onus or the burden of a student feeling that they were costing their peers more.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=682.59s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=683.971s">But</a> I just, the point of information is that we just had a field trip presented to us at our last meeting where this issue was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=694.297s">And</a> so, uh, one, maybe it was a general, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=699.107s">It</a> was a general idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=701.129s">OK,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.069s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.249s">I</a> mean, again, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=704.231s">But</a> I just, you know, the superintendent, I think that the motion is a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=708.554s">We've</a> asked him to develop something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=709.855s">I</a> personally have feelings that I wish to express tonight and have done so.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.172s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.332s">Vandekoot?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.792s">I</a> should hasten to add, though, that if my colleagues were in agreement, I agree 100% with you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=871.655s">Mistone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.455s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.916s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1997.577s">are</a> we going to take a are we going out for a photo yeah
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2231.056s">Kirsten.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2231.316s">We're</a> going to get you out of here before it snows.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2251.61s">Yeah,</a> but we'll do it at the beginning of the meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2833.022s">Yes,</a> I think this actually is for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2836.283s">As</a> a school committee member, I was not aware that we had sustained urgent repairs due to pipe leaks at the high school and bursts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2844.605s">Was</a> that over the holiday break or was that in December when we, on that one cold snap we had?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2889.92s">So</a> at this point, is that area repaired?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2905.172s">Has</a> any section had to be closed down?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2950.883s">Dollars.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2955.906s">Yeah,</a> I'm just thinking what's a minor versus an extraordinary repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2959.868s">So</a> that's what I was asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2962.769s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.05s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.17s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3646.29s">I</a> wanted to go back to the discussion about the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3649.531s">At</a> the time we were doing the walkthroughs, Kathy Kreatz, my fellow school committee member and I, went to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3657.812s">And</a> we submitted to the superintendent a list, including the bleachers, the clock, the things that you guys mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3665.974s">And</a> also at that point, because I don't remember, I'd gone to some other schools too, some of those very same things, the bleachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3672.935s">were</a> on multiple. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3673.936s">So</a> I'm thinking that that's part of the capital plan, because that's when we already talked about some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3683.043s">I</a> think we sort of got to the point where we were going together, and then the superintendent said, because it was difficult to bring us all together, go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3690.909s">And</a> Kathy and I just both happened to do that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3695.952s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4619.098s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to, I think the breakfast actually would be going up 40 cents per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4624.662s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4625.222s">Is</a> it $1.10 to $1.50? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4627.804s">So</a> $2 a week times how many weeks are there in a school year?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4636.87s">So</a> 30, 40 weeks, general 36, you know, times two bucks, 72 bucks in the year just for the breakfast increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4644.116s">So</a> it's certainly with multiple kids adds up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4646.612s">if</a> your student is having breakfast at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4651.255s">I</a> think at this point, it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4654.358s">You're</a> not asking us to take any action tonight, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4656.94s">You</a> can if you want.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4767.75s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4772.773s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4774.515s">I'm</a> not asking for a subcommittee meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4778.452s">on</a> the rate hike. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4779.733s">However,</a> I am asking, it was traditional that we met somewhere along the line during the school year with the school lunch people, and it seems like it's been a long time since we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4792.646s">I</a> don't know whether at some point or another there used to be an advisory committee or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4797.01s">Does</a> any of that exist anymore?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4809.878s">Again,</a> I'm not asking on it from a financial level.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1586.006s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent recently the D ESC put out some new I don't know they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1604.867s">Um,</a> and if the teacher, uh, had a elongated time out, there was an option other than, uh, attacking on school days at the end or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1613.349s">Um</a> I haven't read it completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1615.989s">I</a> was thinking that we would be talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1619.51s">I</a> definitely think that I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1630.732s">tricky</a> in our community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1640.021s">You</a> know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1649.19s">If</a> you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1656.698s">I</a> see this not so much for the one or two day absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1659.601s">I</a> see this in the how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2124.032s">under</a> X. Means he'll be nice and close.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3067.561s">So</a> I have first the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3073.105s">It</a> also included all of those booster clubs or Athletic support groups as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3081.032s">I</a> Think September 1st is a bad day to pick Because it's you know often Labor Day weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3087.157s">I</a> think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th Okay <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3095.121s">I</a> understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3101.868s">However,</a> I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like Mr. Superintendent, micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3113.22s">Can't</a> do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3114.681s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3115.141s">We</a> just can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3116.202s">We</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3117.263s">And</a> if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3122.726s">But</a> I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, or of which I, you know, belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever, that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3138.777s">So</a> I just want to put that out there and say, it makes me real nervous when you went down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3144.922s">And</a> I don't think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3147.364s">I</a> think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3155.01s">Because</a> for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3159.846s">We</a> have a principal sign-off sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3161.927s">However,</a> we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3172.835s">And</a> when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3179.44s">Because</a> we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3186.746s">Now,</a> how formally you play them out is another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3189.088s">But</a> somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3192.631s">Because</a> if you're a 501c3, you needed to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3196.134s">You</a> needed to specify how the offices worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3201.738s">So</a> even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3212.54s">any</a> way otherwise than that I think that we can send it to send it off but those were some of my initial concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.255s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.657s">Mister</a> zero.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3320.283s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3325.175s">Are</a> there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3330.801s">Certainly,</a> if you'd like to step forward.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3593.026s">It</a> would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to raise money for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3612.553s">I</a> know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the money is raised, that the kids get the opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3633.894s">And</a> so I just think that it's really important <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3636.456s">You</a> know, many of you won't remember this, and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3652.321s">And</a> that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3658.543s">Because</a> way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3667.707s">And</a> they were all, blessedly, that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3675.471s">And</a> sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3680.653s">So</a> within all of this in this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3684.095s">By</a> putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4587.352s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4588.573s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4588.733s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4592.135s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4602.534s">that</a> you meant to be speaking up for parents and, in fact, were responding to parents' requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4609.835s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4610.916s">And</a> I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4615.056s">I</a> have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4618.877s">I</a> don't think you meant to be heavy-handed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4620.577s">I</a> don't think you meant to be, cause this uproar. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4623.378s">I</a> don't think so at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4625.278s">I</a> do think you were inexperienced and, frankly, you learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4630.645s">Because</a> you see, you know that it's caused great upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4635.367s">That</a> was very evident the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4639.409s">We</a> agree that we've now got some new things that have come out of this maybe and maybe that's all for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4646.112s">But</a> there were some really hurt feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4650.274s">The</a> treasurer has asked for an apology. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4653.215s">Saying</a> I'm sorry doesn't cost you anything and it would help to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4659.325s">I</a> understand that you didn't mean to hurt, but frankly, you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4666.93s">It</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4668.391s">It's</a> happened to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4670.173s">I</a> didn't mean to, but it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4672.394s">And</a> I said, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4674.035s">Sometimes</a> those two little words are just the easiest thing to say if they're heartfelt and meant, because I truly believe, I truly believe that you meant no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4685.097s">I</a> look forward to working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4687.998s">I</a> look forward to figuring out what it means to be a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4691.76s">You</a> and I have already had some discussions about personal styles, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4696.362s">And,</a> you know, in my view, it is time to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4701.184s">But</a> in order for that to happen, you need to say something.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5683.83s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5877.057s">Before</a> we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion which I thought mr. Ruggiero might Today, mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information and I think that There was <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5896.966s">One</a> Piece which I was uncomfortable with which actually had to do with ski trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5902.209s">It</a> didn't have names on it But if there was names I wanted that to be posted I wasn't certain that I wanted Everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going what time they were going whatever just as a safety thing I think that it's long been a <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5918.138s">thought</a> that I know other school committee members share that some of our documents rather than having this big stack of papers could be online for us as well and so I think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5936.475s">I</a> think we should take both things together, figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5939.416s">There</a> were some questions about afterwards, which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5945.34s">So</a> it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5954.126s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5964.053s">effectively</a> put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can minimize the amount of paper that we have for our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5976.601s">As</a> a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5985.367s">And</a> frankly, it's just way too much.<h2><a href="../2017-01-11_TQ69v4m8ftY/2017-01-11_TQ69v4m8ftY.html">Medford School Committee meeting January 9, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2281.873s">No,</a> I just wanted to thank the parents for coming down and bringing the kids tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2285.775s">My</a> favorite part was hearing the kids tell us about their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2289.336s">Obviously,</a> there's a whole lot going on at the Columbus School, and it's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2294.219s">I'm</a> very familiar with the Little Free Libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2296.4s">I</a> first ran across them in a Chicago neighborhood when I was visiting, and so I'm so proud that we have one now right outside the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2304.544s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.104s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.264s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=527.084s">I</a> just did have a question about the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=529.366s">I</a> thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=545.365s">Well,</a> I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=589.12s">So</a> Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=807.719s">So,</a> you've said a lot of things and I need to tell you that as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=813.961s">First</a> of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=819.647s">because</a> of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=824.131s">That</a> in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=830.436s">And</a> in fact, if you would, divorce myself from the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=835.439s">The</a> statute says that we should be telling parents that there is a option for sanitation, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=845.484s">Sterilization.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.185s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.525s">Sterilization.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=847.826s">Period.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.346s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.947s">That's</a> what the statute says. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=850.108s">And</a> what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=854.631s">And</a> then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, um, uh, that they should be, um, that, that there is this option and it is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=867.021s">That's</a> what I'm voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=868.282s">If</a> I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=875.144s">I</a> think it's, for me, it's a clear cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=877.665s">There's</a> a statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=879.006s">It</a> says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=883.969s">I</a> don't have any hidden agenda.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1386.821s">The</a> one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1391.214s">us</a> that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1398.59s">I</a> think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1404.152s">I</a> don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1410.455s">I</a> think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1417.118s">So</a> I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1418.438s">I</a> haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1427.422s">I</a> want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1543.758s">I</a> was going to suggest we move the question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1623.201s">Madam</a> Mayor, may I ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1625.462s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1625.602s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1626.143s">Does</a> it make any sense to suspend the rules to pick up the adoption of Medford Conversations Project?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2472.495s">And</a> I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2479.08s">And</a> that's why we're going to go ahead and say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2481.662s">I</a> have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2487.206s">But</a> I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents that were so outrageous to me personally of <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2496.635s">discrimination</a> and, uh, inappropriate hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2500.176s">Um,</a> and one was, you know, I went to a craft show and I don't want to go into it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2505.218s">Although</a> if anybody wants to know, I'll, I'll talk to you personally about what happened and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2512.821s">And</a> somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it is unleashed a firestorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2518.523s">And</a> so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2950.812s">Madam</a> Mayor, thank you Beverly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2953.275s">I</a> called Mr. Cieri today and unfortunately he didn't get back to me and now I know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2958.721s">Because</a> I wanted to let him know that also in addition to that the Medford Educational Foundation just approved our grants and our grant cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2967.1s">One</a> of them is for materials for Medford's youngest learners in the kindergarten, for owl pellets across the kindergartens, across the city of Medford in every school, which if anybody hasn't done an owl pellet, you take the pellet apart and the kids find the things that the owl has eaten and it's all very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2985.954s">And</a> we've also approved one at the high school level, the remotely operated underwater vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2990.957s">So</a> those are two things that will be added to the list and we've actually got one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2995.37s">that</a> we're going to be talking to Mr. Cieri about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2997.531s">So</a> he better get back here quickly, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2999.152s">Well,</a> you know, let him recover.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3740.11s">Vanderclute?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3741.23s">So,</a> Beverly, would these be courses that a student is doing at home or during school time?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3774.253s">If</a> I can continue, does this particular product allow for a different usage? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3780.559s">Say</a> a student didn't fail the course but they got a D and now they're a senior and they're realizing that that D is really going to hurt them or that they really need the content of that course. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3793.431s">Is</a> there a way to use it as a review or possibly to improve their grade?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3896.767s">And</a> the other question I have, the only thing that makes me uncomfortable in the protocol you've put forth is the absolute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3904.651s">No</a> outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3908.993s">My</a> preference actually would be no outside of district programs will be accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3912.618s">for</a> credit recovery unless approved by the assistant superintendent or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3919.483s">We</a> could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3920.043s">The</a> reason for that is because I think that you can't foresee everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3925.207s">And</a> there might be a reason why it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3927.749s">And</a> if we're going to adopt this as a policy, my preference is for oversight and for the unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3937.256s">So</a> I would move if it's acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3942.497s">will</a> be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by, and you can decide whether it's the assistant superintendent, the superintendent, the department head, whatever.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3999.353s">Director</a> of guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4000.093s">Director</a> of guidance, that sounds good.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4701.984s">I</a> think we just need to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4704.485s">I</a> did not hear that this is happening in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4708.326s">We</a> are hearing that there is a concern about it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5058.967s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5059.568s">One</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5060.769s">I</a> was surprised that you picked a Monday.<h2><a href="../2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE/2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 21, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=971.712s">All</a> the major ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=973.394s">Is</a> the Zika virus an issue in the Dominican Republic?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1014.758s">My</a> last question is, I'm just curious, it looks like you're going to be staying in the Central Mountain region at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1020.843s">Where</a> are you staying? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1022.765s">What</a> sort of accommodations are the kids in?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1080.3s">Okay,</a> as you're doing that, I'll just mention that I also went on a service trip to the Dominican Republic about five, six years ago, and it was an incredible experience.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1163.203s">I</a> believe there's a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1165.645s">I'll</a> second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1168.467s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1168.627s">Cuno.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3354.441s">As</a> you know, I was at the conference and spent quite a bit of time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3357.944s">I</a> think that the only thing which was unfortunate was that more members of the committee were not able to come this year, because it's not only about talking about the <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3369.441s">The</a> issues at hand are attending the different conference sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3374.43s">It's</a> also about networking, talking to other school committee members, talking, giving, having a chance to talk about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3382.213s">with</a> your colleagues while you're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3384.897s">It's</a> difficult because for me it was three days off from my own job, but it is really worthwhile in the long run and I hope that next year that more people will be able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3400.757s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4492.217s">–</a> Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4493.357s">In</a> looking at the data, there's one thing to me which is a little unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4497.618s">It</a> uses the entire population, 4,529 students, but it doesn't break it down into levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4505.481s">I</a> mean, so you could assume or jump to the conclusion that all of these things are taking place <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4512.247s">at</a> the high school, which there are not many. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4514.127s">I</a> want to be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4516.228s">But</a> that's not necessarily true, or perhaps I don't have the data that tells me whether they're high school or middle school.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4532.271s">So</a> the data, as far as I'm looking at it, would be more helpful if we were to break it down between elementary, middle, and high. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4539.772s">We</a> can do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4548.307s">Aye.</a>

I believe it's 4.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5883.124s">And</a> what, how long do you expect it to run? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5884.926s">It</a> will go till 7.<h2><a href="../2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo/2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 7, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1559.938s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1560.899s">We</a> did have a meeting on October 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1564.121s">I</a> was the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1566.363s">Subcommittee</a> members Mia Mastone and Robert Scurry were present. <a

of Science, Rocco Sieri. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1585.934s">Director</a> of Pupil Services, Kathleen Madaglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1587.975s">Director</a> of ELL, Leslie Trotta. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1590.177s">All</a> of our principals, teachers, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1592.199s">Cole</a> Sanford, and parents, Alexandra Laurie, Alicia Karen, Melanie McLaughlin, Michelle Ciccolo, and Jen Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1601.466s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the 2000 state test results. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1605.91s">We</a> were each provided with the reports on the test results in all areas which are attached to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1612.821s">Deputy</a> Nelson and Assistant Superintendent Caldwell discussed the state testing and the variables affecting the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1618.305s">They</a> explained that the discussion would focus on subgroup data for park rates 3 to 8 and MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1625.471s">Deputy</a> Superintendent introduced Nicole Chiesa, Caroline Joy, and Rocky Cieri. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1630.675s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1632.296s">Caldwell</a> gave a brief history of MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1634.197s">It</a> was also stated there was no state data available this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1638.093s">Vi</a> har en overview av ELA MCAS grad 10 result. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1644.796s">Superintendent</a> Belson clarified the Asian subgroup population. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1649.379s">It</a> is not homogeneous. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1650.759s">It</a> includes a wide range of groups from across the continent, and it varies from city to city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1656.382s">We</a> continued with an overview of the MCAS grade 10 results, and then we went to the science results for grades 5, 8, and 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1664.263s">Discussion</a> was held about the difficulty of disaggregating grade 10 science as students were taking different content areas and are in different grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1672.665s">They</a> also discussed the low scores for grade 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1675.646s">Mr.</a> Cieri said that grade 5 scores were low across the board and he plans research programs this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1681.127s">They</a> also need to look at the budget for material supplies and additional professional development for elementary students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1688.218s">A</a> view of PARC ELA Mathematics for Grades 3 to 8, PARC N to ELA Mathematics for Grades 3 to 8 followed with a review of the highlights and the subgroup data. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1697.803s">Discussion</a> was held regarding computer-based testing at the Andrew School and paper testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1702.965s">It</a> was determined that more time is needed for elementary staff to learn how to use computers when testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1707.808s">Dr.</a> Riccadeli explained the PARC assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1710.449s">This</a> is Medford's first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1712.17s">Students</a> are required to not only answer the question, but also to explain how they got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1717.207s">Mr.</a> Benedetto asked about comparison of like districts to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1721.249s">A</a> report will be generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1722.75s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1722.93s">Nelson</a> described the five-point scale park uses and the four-point MCAS scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1728.153s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1728.313s">Nelson</a> also reviewed student report inconsistencies around the following changes in numbers between levels, plus or minus <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1735.925s">7.4</a> range and the explanation of the legend. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1739.367s">I</a> asked what was the takeaway from the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1741.989s">Superintendent</a> Belson said that we need to get better, improve science and math scores, review and purchase a new elementary science program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1749.151s">and</a> look hard at our specialized population. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1751.632s">There's</a> a lot of transition statewide, and the state is still sorting it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1755.814s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1756.034s">Mastone</a> would like to look at the Brooks School to collaborate on effective teaching strategies around science. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1760.977s">The</a> number of ELL students at the Brooks is much less than the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1765.299s">Testing</a> in 2017 was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1767.48s">The</a> high school will continue to use MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1770.061s">MKS</a> 2.0 is untimed, no long compositions, and will resemble park questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1775.947s">Grades</a> 4 and 8 will have online testing of all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1780.051s">The</a> Andrews will be online testing for all grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1783.414s">A</a> meeting with Revere and Burlington Public Schools is planned to look at infrastructure needs for technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1789.58s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1789.8s">McLaughlin</a> raised concerns around students with disabilities taking MCAS 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1794.982s">It</a> will be discussed in the weeks ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1796.963s">Our</a> meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1799.264s">Respectfully</a> submitted myself as chair.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3228.3s">I</a> think committee of the whole is the way to go initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3232.262s">Melanie,</a> just to respond to your big ask, I think we should start that way because I know one of the concerns is when we get into who's going to be on the subcommittee, and we all want to be, or we have a subcommittee and then we all show up anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3245.43s">But</a> then some people aren't really voting members versus whatever, so I think by starting <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3251.233s">this</a> with a committee of the whole makes a lot of sense, and then perhaps we can move to decide whether a subcommittee makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3259.376s">I'm</a> not anti-subcommittee by any means, focused on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3264.018s">I</a> just understand what some of the challenges are. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3267.959s">It's</a> a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3270.98s">And</a> I think everybody's interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3272.32s">That's</a> one of the things, is we're all interested.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3612.645s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3613.466s">I</a> just wanted to mention that, in fact, that this is only a small part of the grants that we gave out in these funding cycles, and President <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3623.554s">Ann</a> Frenning-Cassooth and David Sayers, who's been the head of the Grants Committee, will be coming forward in a couple of weeks' time to tell you about some of the other grants that we funded either in the spring cycle or we are collecting grants right now and the applications are open. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3640.478s">We</a> decided to extend it to the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3644.92s">It's</a> very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3645.7s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3647.221s">It's</a> really kind of fun to do something positive like this and we really, really appreciate all the teachers who write the grants and also it's been very, very helpful to be working so closely with the school district so that when <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3663.408s">There</a> is a question about is this consistent with our goals, educational goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3667.791s">We</a> have great people and great support, including helping everything work, so I really appreciate that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4539.169s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4539.329s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4541.306s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, I'm wondering if there's any way that we can advocate for that a five-year graduation rate also be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4551.931s">We've</a> talked on multiple occasions that everything has been based on a four-year graduation rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4559.135s">but</a> we have had, as well as many other school systems, additional students who might take a little bit more time, but they do reach the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4567.717s">So</a> I'm wondering if, it mentions the high school graduation rates will still be, you know, part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4573.319s">I'm</a> wondering if there's any way that both the four-year and the five-year graduation rate could be included in when we provide data so that we can look at
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4616.697s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, my question is how do we move along the discussion of including the five-year graduation <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4623.865s">at</a> the state and federal level.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4719.152s">Yeah,</a> I think that's something that our school committee could take as a responsibility of talking about this and bringing it forward when we attend meetings outside of Medford, and also within Medford too.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5214.406s">I</a> think the best is if we could just get to the core of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5219.174s">I</a> think we can do so in one or two sentences.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5355.614s">Is</a> there a way that we should amend this resolution so that it covers our concern? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5362.66s">I'm</a> just looking as I read it, having heard your point.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5880.739s">So</a> there's obviously many, many different levels of conversation that we could have on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5885.701s">I'm</a> going to strictly take mine to the financial. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5890.002s">Right</a> now, it costs Medford approximately $4 million to fund our charter school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5896.843s">We</a> have 10 students less than last year, but it's costing us $270,000 more this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5906.413s">Why</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5907.594s">It's</a> because the state has underfunded the charter school account by $57 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5916.094s">This</a> comes to one of those unfunded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5919.675s">It's</a> not a question of how good charter schools are or how not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5922.856s">Right</a> now we're simply talking about a funding mechanism and the number of charter schools that would be potentially approved by this would only have a greater impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5931.838s">Therefore,</a> I certainly personally have been urging people to vote no on two because of the particular way the funding works. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5940.78s">And</a> I would urge the school committee to take a stand and say vote no on two.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5955.289s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7226.751s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7226.951s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7227.572s">While</a> we're under suspension, I also just <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7229.563s">In</a> our packet, we received a reminder that our next meeting will be on October 24th at the superintendent's conference room to discuss the capital plan and it will begin at 6.30.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7310.967s">In</a> the foyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7311.647s">In</a> the foyer, the lobby. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7314.856s">is</a> that it's also the National Honor Society Information Night, which is 6.30 to 7.30 in the Karen Theater.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7330.004s">Okay,</a> that makes much more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7331.705s">Great,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_P8GypPJIZKM/2025-03-21_P8GypPJIZKM.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Sep. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1014.673s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1015.854s">So</a> that was exactly my question, because I've also received calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1019.477s">And</a> I just spoke to Diane about it, and I'd like her to come forward and give a clarification, because I was told that there were classes where there were 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1028.724s">And</a> I believe it was grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1030.706s">And</a> also, I think it was the kindergarten as well, or 24 or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1036.25s">And</a> it does look, I do have to say, I do have a concern <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1039.49s">If</a> you look at the numbers in kindergarten and look at the numbers in grade one, it looks like the average class size in kindergarten is higher, quite a bit higher than in grade one across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1053.203s">And,</a> you know, it's always been, particularly in kindergarten, that those were the places where we're looking, you know, for low numbers and in, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1063.708s">At</a> the Roberts, even with average class size, 21.5, so there's 22 kids in the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1069.09s">That's</a> a lot of little five-year-olds all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1072.451s">So</a> I am concerned about our kindergarten numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1075.912s">Diane,</a> could you address the concern about the numbers at the Roberts specifically?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1137.045s">But</a> there is 24?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1144.249s">Are</a> the teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1146.673s">Do</a> they feel that's a very amenable way to divide the children fairly, or is that causing... I mean, I understand, but clearly there were parents who were reacting to it, so I'm somewhat curious about the staff.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1189.564s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1191.205s">I'm</a> not quite sure what to think yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1192.866s">I</a> guess part of it depends on <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1195.131s">How</a> many more kids come into the district in those classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1200.475s">Have</a> you been receiving concerns, Diane?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1238.849s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1856.766s">So</a> I just wanted to go back to some of the numbers and if I could ask Diane to come forward again. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1863.158s">So,</a> Diane, there is a difficulty here because we're sort of seeing numbers and, you know, it's kind of us second-guessing the principles, which we understand the fallacy of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1871.77s">I</a> could probably make a strongest argument supporting the way that Mr. Johnson divvies up kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1877.941s">saying</a> it may be in fact the most equitable way, because we all know that one very difficult student, a teacher might prefer three easy students in comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1889.45s">But</a> it does raise some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1891.512s">One</a> of the questions I see elsewhere is that at the Columbus on the first grade, we are as class size as low as 14 students, while the kindergarten is up to 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1900.779s">And</a> playing around, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1904.081s">I</a> almost wondered, gee, would we have better off to have an extra kindergarten teacher and divide it up in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1911.586s">So</a> I'm curious why that decision was made.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1963.153s">Do</a> all of those teachers at the Columbus School have full-time aides?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1972.597s">So</a> three out of four. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1973.537s">And</a> does the fourth teacher have the same 21 kids?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1987.083s">Well,</a> you know, again, looking at the number, I think that that's where we might be saying, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1992.742s">I</a> understand the superintendent saying, look, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2005.956s">We've</a> got great class sizes, and I've certainly spoken to other people in other towns, and I know we have great class sizes, but still, my expectation was more that they're in the 17-18 range. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2016.26s">When</a> I see going up to 22, that's definitely concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2021.622s">In</a> the Roberts School, one of the things I want to ask you about the kindergarten class specifically, since the principal told us that, you know, are there any kindergarten classrooms with 24 or 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2033.487s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2034.668s">Okay,</a> so they're divided equitably? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2037.631s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2049.44s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2050.04s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2050.621s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2052.122s">Well,</a> I mean, if I look at this sheet at the second grade, it says average class size 22, but you've told me that there's some with 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2061.409s">And</a> if I look at kindergarten, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2062.938s">It</a> says average class size 21.5, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2066.639s">So</a> would one kindergarten class have 20 and the other have 24? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2069.099s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2069.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2072.46s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2077.341s">Well,</a> I really think that looking at the numbers, we might look at how that Columbus, that one class which doesn't have a kindergarten aid in equity seems like a need there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2090.184s">At</a> the Columbus School, you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2090.924s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2091.264s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2250.552s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2250.732s">Vanden</a> Heuvel? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2251.472s">No,</a> it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2252.332s">You're</a> all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2252.832s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4683.081s">Yes,</a> I just also think the report was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4685.183s">I</a> think this is one of those good news reports, and it's important that we that we hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4689.727s">I</a> particularly also liked hearing, you know, that there was a challenge and that's and we're looking at our summer school for grades six and seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4698.034s">I</a> think that's very valuable for us to hear as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4700.536s">So</a> I appreciate the delivery of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4703.318s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Skerry.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5288.055s">No,</a> I have it at home, but I don't know which of the three days the delegate assembly is. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5292.538s">It's</a> Wednesday.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5307.528s">I'd</a> like to be the alternate.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5625.472s">I'd</a> also just like to add a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5627.513s">Tonight,</a> before the school committee, the members of the school committee were down at the McGlynn and Andrews property, which, as you know, is on Freedom Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5639.848s">And</a> it was named Freedom Way because our schools opened in 2001 on 9-10. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5649.932s">And</a> on Tuesday morning, I happened to be there dropping off my child and, you know, doing those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5657.155s">And</a> it was sitting outside of the Andrews School that I had my radio on and heard the report and went into the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5664.318s">And</a> so as I sit there and sat, and of course this being such a, you know, important anniversary <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5670.0s">The</a> schools to me are also so very closely tied to that memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5674.141s">And</a> our commitment to each and every one of our students and families in Medford to have a free, wonderful education, because that is what I think is the most important thing in our democracy for all our kids.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gUPvnttl-cs/2025-03-21_gUPvnttl-cs.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Aug. 29, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=756.473s">Can</a> I ask a question about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=757.913s">Sure,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=758.233s">Vanderhoof.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=760.234s">Could</a> you please tell us what you're replacing the curbing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=762.914s">I</a> thought that was a higher cost item that was going to be looked at in terms of the capital improvement plan when we spoke about it last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=772.617s">So</a> I'm curious, since we've already seen that curbing had a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=779.058s">I'm</a> wondering what you're replacing it with.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=804.832s">So</a> how are we correcting it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=812.718s">But</a> the same type of curb?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=814.46s">It's</a> a stronger material though.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=817.422s">Because</a> what, obviously my question is what's going to prevent that, the same thing from happening again?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=823.347s">And</a> I definitely thought we were looking at a different material completely, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=827.11s">I'm</a> a little concerned about that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=831.113s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.035s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.996s">Well,</a> we'll discuss this, I guess, with capital improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=840.079s">So</a> in essence, this is step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.36s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.841s">A</a> temporary fix.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1182.441s">Madam</a> Mayor, I just want to request that when that happens all the school committee members are informed of when there might be an opportunity to view it so that it's not, so that we can all have access to that information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1371.284s">Just</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1372.204s">You</a> just mentioned dye lots, and that hit upon another concern I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1376.967s">I'm</a> really glad painting is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1379.868s">You</a> mentioned the McGlynn in particular, but I was concerned because we spent hours and hours and days and months when we initially picked out colors, and I'm under the impression that there's no longer existing paint from the original project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1397.518s">So</a> I just wondered what paint you used, how you match colors.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1411.547s">And</a> they still make them?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2302.972s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2303.152s">Van</a> der Kloot, so, you know, obviously it makes sense to go through this tonight, but I think that as a committee member, my expectation was that we would be visiting the schools and walking them and looking at them perhaps more intensely. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2316.755s">So</a> that's my first comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2318.135s">My</a> second comment is when we hit, if you just kind of look at some of the money in the columns, you know, a lot of the, I always thought that if we were going to do a capital improvement plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2329.997s">We</a> would be putting more money in year one and not waiting until year four to get to playground surfacing or some of these other things, which we've talked about for quite a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2340.463s">So</a> I'm a little surprised at how they're skewed so late.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2693.543s">I</a> thought we were going to have to go through the list.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2785.15s">As</a> I look down the list, perhaps I thought we were going to read through the list first, but one of the questions that pops out to me is skateboard area deconstructed and modular units installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2800.273s">and</a> you know we've not discussed that, why are we installing modular units, why would we be doing that, why is it on a priority list, etc.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2858.452s">Right,</a> so I don't even know how to address all of that in the context of this plan right now because there's many, many different questions embedded in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2866.555s">So</a> I see it as one of the things that administration has put down on this capital planning list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2875.338s">But</a> as a school committee member sort of understanding that the whole impetus or urgency or not or whatever, that's just simply not clear at this time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3372.461s">I</a> think the appropriate thing to say is that we appreciate her very much and so we're not going to let her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3376.282s">We're</a> going to tie you up and we're just going to keep you here because we need you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3380.644s">You've</a> just been so fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3382.805s">We</a> adore you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3506.869s">Great,</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3508.35s">So</a> you just heard us talk about capital planning and putting together a capital planning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3515.736s">What</a> experience do you have in doing something similar and what were your thoughts as we were discussing it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3567.589s">You've</a> already seen we're talking a bunch and we all have our own concerns and agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3574.975s">And</a> obviously you would report to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3578.118s">But</a> we're here too and we're very interested in what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3581.44s">How</a> do you handle that balance for the need of school committee members who approach you for information, which we do with Pat all the time, versus your report to the superintendent?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3626.269s">What</a> would you do if you disagreed with him?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4313.3s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4663.42s">My</a> question was actually going to be on the mayor's follow-up question, which is if we had a situation where here in the city of Medford your role would be part of
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4758.855s">So</a> I guess I'm going to go back to the superintendent school committee relations and I'm going to ask you what your expectations of both the superintendent and the school committee is and and how you've worked with them in your previous positions.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4817.762s">At</a> this point, have you seen our budget books, like for the budget for this school year? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4822.883s">Not</a> for FY17. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4823.984s">I</a> have reviewed prior budgets online. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4827.905s">And</a> is it similar, was it similar in your previous position that you would put together, be responsible for
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6150.565s">What</a> do you see as the most challenging part of this new job?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6183.052s">And</a> have you had experience in collective bargaining?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6251.911s">And</a> lastly, was it typical for you to attend, I don't, in Fitchburg, is it town meeting or? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6259.253s">Council</a> meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6260.434s">Council</a> meetings?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6272.898s">You've</a> heard that here it's very typical for our Director of Finance and Administration to attend every school committee meeting, multiple other meetings, and to stay late often. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6282.485s">That's</a> fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7958.586s">Diane,</a> do you attend every school committee meeting in Arlington?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7995.758s">That's</a> interesting that that's something you negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7997.82s">Here</a> it is customary, more often than not, that our finance director is at our meetings or at our beck and call. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8005.645s">So</a> that sort of leads me to the second question is, what are your expectations regarding your relationship, both with the superintendent, your boss, if you would, and the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8016.488s">And</a> how has that worked? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8019.071s">I</a> know in Cambridge, I'm not sure whether you had direct contact with the school committee?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8052.773s">Can</a> I ask why this position in Medford interests you and why you would be leaving Arlington? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8058.496s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8180.166s">Well,</a> I have heard about town meetings in Arlington, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8184.208s">I</a> did want to ask you one thing about your resume, and I'm not even sure if you know this, but under every single job experience you've had, it says, please do not contact this employer.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8224.197s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8224.718s">But</a> it's a funny thing because on it, it feels kind of negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8227.359s">So</a> that was why I was curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8230.221s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8239.766s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8240.286s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8240.727s">Thank</a> you very much for explaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8241.787s">Robert</a> Evans, Scary Junior.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8785.947s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8790.089s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8791.85s">You</a> gave us a number of students in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8793.951s">What</a> is their budget?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8816.39s">And</a> I just wondered, in terms of the transportation routes, you mentioned special ed, which I'll set aside.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8856.411s">Okay,</a> and I guess the last question is I'd like you to tell me about a difficult situation which you faced in Arlington and how you resolved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8865.6s">Fiscal?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8866.961s">Behavioral?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8868.042s">I'm</a> going to let you pick. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8869.203s">Oh,</a> boy.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9072.255s">Well,</a> I'm not going to make that mistake a second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9075.318s">Diane,</a> you know our motto, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9077.6s">On</a> time and on budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9079.221s">Love</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9080.702s">After</a> my own heart.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo/2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo.html">Medford, MA School Committee - June 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=491.482s">So</a> prior to our budget night, I had no idea that we were moving in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=498.687s">We</a> hadn't really been apprised of this along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=502.289s">So</a> I don't really understand whether this requires a vote of the school committee to affirm the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=509.353s">I</a> don't know if it's a decision or it's just what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=513.536s">Could</a> you perhaps explain that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=534.087s">So</a> just out of curiosity, are there other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=537.048s">Or</a> is this the option?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=559.657s">Yeah,</a> I know.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=562.278s">So</a> I guess I'd like to ask, uh, Mr. Maloney, whether any sports will be impacted, for example, uh, will right now our swimming season is during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=574.382s">Um,</a> but I know some schools have different swimming seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=579.163s">So</a> does anybody, anything change for us?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=612.681s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1533.64s">And</a> just one, on the registered MPS booster organizations will be allowed available times, times not otherwise booked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1541.444s">And</a> so, booked by when? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1544.025s">Are</a> we talking a week in advance, two weeks in advance? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1546.406s">How?</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1565.349s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1609.252s">We're</a> not paying for field workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1611.032s">And</a> the money is going directly to the programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1613.393s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1613.893s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1614.593s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2568.544s">I</a> just want to thank the superintendent for putting the report together. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2573.869s">I</a> think it gives us a, it's good to have this outline for us and in our records. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2580.374s">I</a> make a motion to accept the paper and place it on file.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3076.34s">So</a> in the past, it's been customary that the superintendent has sent us out a report on or about <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3083.713s">August</a> 1st to 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3085.595s">And</a> that actually is not specified in this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3089.078s">So</a> while it says that you will give us updates, I'd like to formalize it and say that there will be a midsummer report will be sent out to the committee by the superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3249.102s">My</a> feeling about it is I've always found that sort of mid-August report really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3255.984s">So</a> I'm not really looking for a meeting to happen August 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3261.186s">I'd</a> be more inclined to have a meeting the third week of August or, you know, the next week before, you know, either right prior to school or now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3272.629s">Of</a> course, we start school before vacation, but I think we're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3276.128s">before</a> Labor Day, but not necessarily midsummer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3279.771s">August</a> 1st is, you know, I think it should be a little bit later than that, personally.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3847.37s">I</a> just want to say that I think one of the things that was very clear was that there was such an agreement when your name was brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3858.469s">you</a> know, amongst the parents, amongst the faculty, and amongst the school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3863.513s">We</a> had, as school committee members, had the opportunity, well, in some ways to watch you grow personally, but also to have you present to us on any number of times and to see you actually working. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3875.982s">So</a> if you would, it was a classic no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3878.064s">Congratulations.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4307.356s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4308.497s">I</a> spoke to Pat on the way in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4311.751s">and</a> noted that in the letter that it specified to be spent on new musical equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4317.915s">And</a> I think it would be better to deposit back to the school department to be used by the fine arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4328.521s">Some</a> of the needs that we heard last week from the band director was not necessarily musical equipment, but there were other needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4335.646s">So</a> I just wanted to give us more leeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4344.094s">Music</a> department? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4345.457s">Music</a> department is fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4465.168s">So</a> I wanted to address the budget modifications that the superintendent has given us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4471.47s">In</a> my mind, the superintendent has met the concerns that the school committee seemed fairly much in unison, as different as we all are, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4486.287s">there</a> was a theme and these were definitely the ones that I was most concerned about and heard others speak to as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4492.868s">So</a> I'm very, very happy to see that money has been found for these, what I consider to be necessary items. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4502.97s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that the school committee affirm the Medford Public Schools budget for the year 2017 <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4515.197s">with</a> the inclusion of these budget modifications.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6068.561s">Thanks,</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6071.822s">I</a> guess I just want to add one thing in that for the Paris that <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6075.435s">are</a> brought in from special education, that's also part of the IEP process of determining whether a particular student, what they need or how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6088.184s">So</a> that's where it's sort of spelled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6091.986s">I</a> guess I just really wanted to say that the other night when we did our budget, I think that there was some level of frustration because obviously we had needs or desires that we thought were <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6105.095s">essential.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6106.256s">And</a> I know, Mia, at some point you said, what is the point of all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6111.48s">And</a> kind of said, you know, there is a level of trust working with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6119.145s">But</a> the point of all of it was we went through the budget and we identified key areas that we believed were critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6127.051s">And</a> that there was a real purpose to that work the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6131.854s">And</a> now you've seen the fruition of it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6135.8s">And</a> I think that we're also saying and realizing, you know, again, this budget is a, you sort of set the bottom line, but there was movement with it depending on what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6146.525s">It's</a> not a static document.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6836.042s">I</a> think it would make more sense if the fourth quarter, is it the third quarter, would be part, would be the budget report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6846.766s">So</a> you're not preparing five, you're doing quarterly reports, and one of them is with the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6857.486s">I</a> see, okay.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6937.225s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7252.5s">So</a> given the adjustments that were made, I'm not quite sure why my colleagues now have voted against it, the two that did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7262.864s">And</a> I, too, was looking for unity because that is what we want to go into and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7271.108s">I</a> do understand that people might have preferences, and I'm sure, for example, that many of my colleagues would, in fact, like to have <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7279.007s">said</a> we're going to do kindergarten aides across the city all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7284.852s">This</a> is a very large budget with many other things, very important things to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7290.816s">We've</a> added an English teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7292.838s">We've</a> added lots of different elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7299.283s">I</a> think that the committee has spoken and said, yes, there is a desire in the future to add that we're starting out with the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7306.608s">It's</a> a level three school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7309.123s">justification</a> for why we're starting in this particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7312.848s">I</a> hasten to remind everybody that when we get to kindergarten aids, the money, the dollars seem short, but the obligation of the city in terms of the additional finances for healthcare are significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7327.354s">So</a> I think that the beginnings of this budget and on that particular issue have been addressed, and it's clearly been heard that there is a desire to increase as we go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7347.682s">So</a> I share with the superintendent frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7351.064s">I</a> know the other night, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7355.111s">I</a> had hoped to have a unified budget, and there were some levels of consternation because there were so many things that weren't clear, and tonight we've now clarified those in, I think, a very, very positive manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7373.74s">I</a> for one would ask my colleagues to reconsider their vote, and I would like to have a discussion and see, because I'm not quite sure if that's the only issue that's outstanding, and I'm not understanding something else for that negative vote by my colleagues, that I would urge you to reconsider, because a budget is a huge <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7398.108s">Entity,</a> it is not a one issue question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7402.211s">We</a> are here for the good of all of our students, whether they're in kindergarten or whether they're in a high school senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7409.697s">Every</a> student is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7411.558s">And</a> to hold up that unity on a budget because of one issue, especially when so much progress has been made, I believe is not in the best interest of the public schools and the children and families we serve.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7746.873s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7748.474s">Madam</a> Mayor, I wouldn't want anyone to think that we couldn't vote, certainly as we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7753.939s">And</a> it's just that, quite honestly, I was surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7757.041s">I</a> want to make it clear, by the way, that there have been years where I have voted against the budget because I was concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7763.919s">that</a> the entire budget level was short, and that we were not meeting the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7770.623s">So</a> please understand that it's not, that I've never, that I've always been in agreement with the bottom line, but that's really the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7778.068s">In</a> some ways, it's the ultimate bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7780.87s">I</a> didn't understand why my colleagues voted against it, and that's why I said what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7785.372s">I</a> am wondering, since the superintendent has made a statement sort of saying, geez, I'd rather go in with a unified force, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7794.777s">whether</a> there was a point in my asking for reconsideration so that we could vote it again if any colleague had a feeling that they were persuaded for some sense of unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7807.872s">But</a> if there's not, then I respect your votes, and I'm not going to bother for a reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7813.621s">So</a> I was just trying to sort of feel out whether either of my colleagues who voted against the budget wanted to reconsider their thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7828.953s">If</a> you're willing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8103.692s">So,</a> Madam Mayor, just to conclude the discussion, then, I certainly want to express to my two colleagues that I appreciate their due diligence, and I respect their votes, even if I disagree with it and would have preferred it a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8116.019s">However,</a> even though, Erin, you've asked many questions, and I can know some of your areas of concern, I still was surprised, because I thought we were more on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8126.806s">Now</a> that you've articulated exactly where you're coming from, I appreciate it, I understand it, and I now understand the vote better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8134.439s">So</a> thank you and we'll, if we could, did we call the vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8138.385s">No.</a>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2653.306s">But</a> even in general, talking about a disability such as autism,
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2712.086s">But</a> I've also seen, you know, on TV stories about, you know, classrooms of kids who once they understood <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2719.918s">the</a> disabilities of a child in their class, what a team they became with that child. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2725.341s">So</a> I think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2726.622s">Now,</a> just to get to one question, on your indicators graduation rate, I just want to ask you whether you use the four-year graduation rate for Medford or the five-year graduation rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2737.527s">We</a> used whatever DESE had on their site. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2739.908s">Because</a> I think that there's a big difference for us between four-year <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2743.979s">Okay,</a> in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2745.02s">Oh,</a> interesting, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2745.98s">Right,</a> and so students, if I recall correctly, I mean, it does take some students longer, but that doesn't mean that they're unsuccessful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2753.843s">In</a> fact, it means they're very successful and they've stuck to it and really, and so when we look at that, I think it's a, that particular detail is important in our understanding overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2765.247s">Yeah,</a> I would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2766.847s">Obviously,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2767.468s">I'd</a> like to compare them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2768.508s">Yeah,</a> and I don't remember exactly, but I remember at some point looking at that and saying that was interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2775.695s">In</a> terms of your call for the DSAC technical assistance, I thought, are we already having a DSAC team come in, or where are we?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2790.611s">Mr.</a> Superintendent.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2833.212s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2833.732s">Um,</a> I think, um, the other thing that the PAC called for was the endorse inclusion and endorse an inclusion subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2841.514s">And</a> I think that that would also be a valuable thing to discuss that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2844.815s">And</a> I agree that that would be an appropriate follow-up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2875.688s">Oh,</a> and the last thing I just had jotted down was robocalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2880.572s">It</a> would seem that we ought to be able to include PAC meeting information in a robocall <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2888.348s">You</a> know, it might be a standalone call or it might be something that other things are being announced at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2895.191s">So</a> I certainly think we ought to work on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3897.633s">You</a> know, I certainly applaud the desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3900.856s">I'm</a> a little concerned about the fact that right now the timing is so tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3905.239s">We're</a> scheduled to go into a budget meeting next Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3908.601s">We</a> have to be cognizant that the superintendent and the administration are <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3917.44s">preparing</a> that budget and that takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3919.941s">So</a> I'm not quite sure where we manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3922.721s">We've</a> got graduation on Wednesday of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3925.182s">I</a> just, I'm just not quite sure where we're going to put it in.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3966.191s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3966.451s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3966.511s">Maybrook.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4959.734s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4959.914s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4961.154s">At</a> one time, I recall when this was an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4964.358s">many</a> years ago, we started tracking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4968.721s">And,</a> of course, it was a bloody pain in the neck for the teachers, but it did enforce what the policy was and that they had to inform the principal when recess was withheld from a student just for tracking purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4986.811s">Now,</a> of course, over the <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4988.608s">period</a> of time, then it sort of fell by the wayside, but at least temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4992.031s">I</a> keep on hearing this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4994.053s">I</a> think we're clear on our policy that it is the exception, the exceptional exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4999.999s">It</a> is not supposed to be something that is done frequently, but yet I keep on hearing it, so we clearly have an ongoing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5009.488s">I</a> am wondering, one of the things you just said, Mr. Superintendent, is recess, part of the problem is recess is not part of time and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5017.232s">It's</a> not considered by the DESC to be important, and maybe what we should do is to write <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5027.456s">motion</a> this year to go before the MASC and start advocating for recess minutes to count as an indication of how important those are when we're talking about our whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5041.505s">And</a> that would be an active thing that the Medford School Committee could talk about and take to a statewide level.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5049.581s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5050.101s">That</a> the MASC, I mean, sorry, that the Medford School Committee craft a motion regarding recess being part of time and learning, which would be brought before the MASC committee, the resolutions committee, which is coming up pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5067.549s">It's</a> a good thought.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5113.136s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5115.058s">I</a> think, Mia, that it needs to be not just for the Roberts Handbook, but it needs to be our Medford Public School Committee
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5130.55s">So</a> what we need to do as a committee is to look at the four handbooks and see what is actually in our online handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5141.998s">And</a> we've talked about a couple of other meetings, and if we need to define some wording and make sure that it's clear, that is what we should be doing in terms of... <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5153.794s">putting</a> out clarity from the school committee, a policy from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5157.777s">And</a> I agree with you that, obviously, if Ellery's saying to us, you know, it's really vague, well, we hear that and we need to make it clear.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5405.689s">I</a> just want to thank you for this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5407.15s">I</a> thought this was great, an important step for us, and I just was really pleased to read what we're doing, Tony.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6828.317s">So</a> this clearly is an issue not only for the school committee, but the city of Medford overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6834.74s">Right,</a> so at some point as it becomes refined, that needs to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6839.082s">I</a> also see that there is a reasonable, a city or town may charge a reasonable fee, and I would think that they would need to have some discussion about what a reasonable fee is for this request.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6852.448s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6854.081s">So</a> when this is, when everything is settled, I would certainly want to have it on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6863.266s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6864.266s">Motion</a> to accept.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6887.007s">What</a> is the?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7201.792s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7202.992s">I</a> also just wanted to mention that over the time, the opportunities that I've had seeing the assistant principal interact with parents and with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7212.495s">Again,</a> as you said, she did a great job answering questions and fielding questions when the school council reports were submitted both this year and last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7225.438s">And</a> I would very much concur that it seems like there's wide <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7231.608s">spread</a> support from the people I've spoken to, and I think that this would be a very good move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7237.49s">I,</a> too, don't wish to do a process, which is, you know, you said dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7244.272s">We</a> don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7245.193s">I</a> was curious, were there any other people who had come to speak on this tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7252.975s">Oh,</a> okay.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=707.058s">So</a> tonight, I was so excited because I knew that when I came to the meeting that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=713.001s">Chang</a> and the students would be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=715.081s">And</a> you know, we've watched each year asking for them to come and perform at our school committee meeting because there's no better reminder for us of what excellence we have in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=735.634s">I</a> am so, so proud of these students, the work, the determination, looking at their faces, looking at the concentration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=745.801s">And</a> also, one of the other privileges that I've had is to watch them go on, go on to the high school, talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=754.706s">They're</a> siblings that I've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=757.708s">One</a> family member moves on up to the high school, but another family member comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=762.531s">I</a> want to thank the parents for making sure <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=765.153s">that</a> their students get to all of these performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=768.214s">I</a> want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=770.696s">Cheng</a> for her amazing dedication to these students and to the music program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=777.059s">And</a> students, I want to commend you on your excellent performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=780.66s">It</a> is wonderful to achieve at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=782.941s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1886.486s">I'd</a> like to ask for suspension of the rules so that we could have community participation prior to the report of committees.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1897.023s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2236.025s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2236.205s">Vanden</a> Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2238.187s">I</a> just want to thank Anne and David for being here today, because I am part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2243.43s">I</a> know how hard they've worked to make this successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2246.973s">I</a> think many of us have heard about some of the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2249.554s">Actually,</a> I read about some of them in the newspaper and whatever, and I knew that they were also projects that the Medford Educational Fund had funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2259.741s">So</a> thank you to them for being here, and we appreciate the support of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2266.14s">I</a> should also, I'd like to quickly add that it's been incredibly helpful to, Pat Vili has guided us on some of the financial things that we needed help with, and we really, really appreciate Pat's help and direction.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3777.475s">So</a> I just want to back up for a second and remind everybody here that actually I've been through two superintendent searches already, but first for Superintendent DeVoe, an outside candidate, and secondly for Superintendent Belson, who was an internal candidate at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3793.655s">So</a> I've actually got a little bit of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3796.677s">Also,</a> I just want to assure everybody that there is no way, and I kind of recoil from your word haphazard, that I would allow this to be a haphazard process for picking the most important job that we have in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3813.75s">In</a> fact, if you go back, when I ran for school committee this time, one of the things I talked about was that we will be entering a transition period. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3822.617s">and</a> it will be vitally important that we take our time and we do due diligence and we have a very successful transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3832.863s">And</a> that's particularly because I am involved and have been involved on the statewide level at the MASC and we've talked to our colleagues from other districts who've done superintendent searches and we've gotten, Anne Marie and I have gotten some pretty good feedback <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3848.632s">We've</a> also had the opportunity to talk, you know, they will do superintendent searches. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3855.156s">There</a> is a process with them that we could choose to, at the time, ask for their assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3862.1s">Of</a> course, no decision like that has been made, but we are well aware of that as a potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3867.182s">By</a> the way, Angela, I did want to tell you that I did not receive an email from you, and that's been a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3871.925s">Somehow</a> emails that are sent directly to the school are not coming to me, so use my Gmail address. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3877.814s">please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3879.135s">So</a> again, no way would I allow someone with 26 years of experience on the Medford School Committee, who lives and breathes this job, would I allow this to be a haphazard process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3892.781s">I</a> also want to remind everybody that this year, we've had three new school committees join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3899.044s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3899.244s">Kreatz,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3900.477s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3900.697s">Mostoni,</a> and in fact the mayor, is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3903.7s">They</a> joined us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3905.602s">That</a> was not the time to spring into action to do the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3911.167s">They</a> needed an opportunity to work with the superintendent and find out for themselves what kind of man he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3921.419s">You</a> don't just go and evaluate somebody who you've only worked for for six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3929.748s">So</a> our evaluation process is a little later this year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3933.432s">It</a> is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3934.954s">The</a> evening with the superintendent is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3937.977s">I</a> would have it no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3943.498s">Sometimes</a> it feels like there's another elephant in the room, and certainly there are some citizens that would prefer the superintendent not to perhaps indicate that he would like to stay another year or so on top of his current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3959.544s">And</a> it's all very interesting, this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3962.118s">The</a> superintendent is a man who has to make some tough decisions, and he has to lead, and he's been our leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3968.6s">He</a> has a backbone, and so he's spoken out about things like the drain of finances that was caused by our students going to Minuteman, and he worked hard to end that procession out and to, in fact, then booster our own Medford Vocational School so that it would be the jewel that it is growing to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3989.624s">We're</a> so proud of that, such a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3992.525s">He</a> talks out on a statewide level about the inequity of charter school funding and the problems of the funding formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4000.469s">And</a> every so often, he gets really pissed off, and he speaks inappropriately, perhaps, to a citizen, and that's my view, and I can tell every single one of you that when I feel he's crossed a line, I'm the first one to tell him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4016.397s">But</a> he is a magnificent leader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4019.125s">he</a> will be hard to replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4021.988s">We</a> will also need to look about and think very strongly about, and I've actually already had some discussions with the superintendent himself, which at some point along the line when we sit down, the whole school committee will have to consider not only his role, but what is the role of the other people who might, because he's leaving, decide to go with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4041.466s">It's</a> a bigger picture than just the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4044.978s">Now,</a> you said to us, why didn't we say anything to you in April? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4048.321s">We</a> were coming up cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4049.401s">I</a> didn't know you were coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4050.762s">I</a> hadn't looked at the date on the superintendent's contract that night, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4054.985s">We</a> had a school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4056.707s">We've</a> gone through incredibly busy weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4058.888s">I</a> don't know if people realize how busy this school committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4062.651s">One</a> week I was out so many nights, and look, this is just, we're here today, May 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4067.735s">We</a> have a meeting on May 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4069.096s">We</a> have a meeting on May 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4070.277s">We</a> have a meeting on May 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4071.558s">We</a> have a meeting on May 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4073.34s">We</a> have the M Club dinner on the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4075.481s">We</a> have 6th, 7th, 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4077.243s">We</a> are incredibly busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4079.224s">It</a> is, we have to get all of us together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4081.666s">Now,</a> should this be a priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4083.027s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4083.908s">But</a> I would hold that we are taking our steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4086.791s">The</a> superintendent will give us his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4090.936s">We</a> will deliberate on that evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4093.499s">We</a> will ask him for his preferences regarding a contract and we will deliberate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4099.045s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4100.245s">We</a> will go through the extraordinary busy time of getting the budget, and we need to realize that the superintendent and his, everybody in the administration needs to spend time to put that budget together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4115.008s">That's</a> the time of year it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4116.688s">I</a> assure you that this will not be a haphazard process, and I want to add, over my dead body.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4736.203s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4736.843s">I</a> think that the contract reads that we have to inform the superintendent by June 30 if our intention is not to rehire him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4744.728s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4745.829s">It</a> doesn't say not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4747.99s">Do</a> you have a copy of it before? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4751.012s">I</a> brought it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4752.493s">Could</a> you just read the first sentence or that sentence?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.338s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.478s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.598s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4868.579s">So,</a> you know, I don't have any problem voting for the motion, but the superintendent has just told us that he's going to provide it to us by Friday, and he's just told us that we've got a meeting on the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4879.624s">So,</a> in fact, my colleague is, by putting it in motion, is making it sound as if <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4884.006s">You</a> know, she's doing something like a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4886.767s">But</a> I just have to be clear that we've already put out and said that we're going to be doing these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4891.769s">I</a> have no problem voting for it because we just said we'd do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4894.69s">But,</a> you know, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4898.772s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4900.292s">Well,</a> it seems redundant to me.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4975.663s">I</a> am afraid that by saying, oh, we're going to have the whole thing done and created by June 30th is inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4983.371s">The</a> piece that we need to do is we need to let the superintendent know, after he lets us know what he wants, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4991.34s">what</a> our intent is with his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4993.482s">But</a> there are many, many pieces, and to just define it by June 30th, when you know how many meetings, I mean, some of you have yet to go through a budget meeting and what other meetings we might have in the end of the school year business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5005.573s">I</a> have no problem meeting during the summer and working on a succession plan if we need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5010.899s">I</a> have no issue with that to tie us into a June 30th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5017.564s">So,</a> I think it would be more appropriate is to inform the superintendent upon our intent and then subsequently, I mean, to make, to create and affirm a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5035.671s">I</a> just have to tell you, I mean, there's many pieces to a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5039.405s">And</a> there's going to be many, many parts of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5041.846s">So</a> I'm a little concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5043.387s">Absolute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5044.387s">Oh,</a> we're going to have the succession plan by June 30th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5049.629s">Um,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5052.73s">Uh,</a> so that the, uh, could you just say how it read right now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5099.904s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5100.165s">So</a> that's why the word saying a process would be more appropriate because it gives us then the leeway of understanding the superintendent's role in informing us at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5111.693s">However,</a> there is certainly no harm in us having discussions about <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5115.969s">all</a> the different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5116.79s">And</a> by the way, just one thing I do want to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5119.191s">You</a> know, someone brought up their concern, and I absolutely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5123.134s">What</a> if something happened to the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5126.216s">And</a> for years and years and years, the biggest criticism I had of the superintendent, we used to say, delegate, you have to delegate, you have to delegate, because he seemed to be the guy who knew everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5137.903s">But</a> one of the things, he's been very successful, and I have to say that he really, you know, he really listened to us, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5145.765s">He</a> also speaks a lot shorter than he used to, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5148.546s">But</a> the thing that he does now is he is delegated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5152.489s">And</a> so I know that, God forbid, something happened to the superintendent, that he has so many strong administrative people working for him and our principals and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5162.614s">It</a> is not, I mean, I hope you understand in my saying this, Roy, that if he all of a sudden had a terrible accident that we would be left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5170.958s">without</a> leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5172.479s">That's</a> not the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5174.02s">We</a> have very strong leaders across the board, so many talented individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5179.583s">And</a> believe me, that has been one of the things that, as I've watched the process over the years, has really changed, that I feel confident that we would not all of a sudden be rudderless in a storm.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5450.167s">Yes,</a> that's right.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5451.387s">I</a> mean, you're a taxpayer, so you don't have to keep on saying, I don't have kids in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5455.028s">You</a> are a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5455.908s">You</a> are a citizen of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5457.069s">You</a> have every right to be concerned about the schools in our community as any other person, any parent, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5463.891s">Well,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6074.747s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6074.947s">Van</a> der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6076.067s">So,</a> Bob, one thing I just want to mention to you is that our thinking actually isn't that far apart, because recently I attended the National School Board Conference, and I said to Anne Marie, who was with me at the time, come on, come on, we have to go down and talk to these people, because the topic was how to successfully survey your school population so it's meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6099.796s">And</a> so that's very much been part of my thinking of sort of saying that it is time <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6103.65s">I</a> believe, to reach out and to send a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6105.911s">But,</a> you know, surveys can be useless and they can be powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6110.814s">And</a> that's, so that was my thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6115.177s">I</a> do want to mention to you also that we do establish goals every fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6120.92s">We</a> talk about them publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6122.601s">We</a> argue about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6124.422s">And</a> those are our guiding lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6126.763s">Again,</a> personally, I think now we're clearly at the place where we need a succession, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6131.807s">to</a> talk about this and I will just assure you that it will happen.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6137.574s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6140.577s">I</a> certainly think they should.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6145.478s">Well,</a> Bob, you know, every year we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6148.338s">Every</a> year, you know, we have three people in the audience.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6571.862s">So,</a> as my colleague said, we had a meeting about a curriculum subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6576.926s">Now,</a> I need to clarify something, and part of the problem is this is very, very complex, and if you just go on and you just look at a ranking, it will totally lead you in ways that are not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6588.856s">First</a> of all, my colleague mentioned we're level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6592.279s">Well,</a> we have one school which is in level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6595.441s">We</a> were one point away from being level two. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6597.442s">They</a> can't tell us what we did wrong so that we get level two, but that's part of the complexity of it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6602.366s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6602.666s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6603.206s">We</a> are a level one high school and have been so for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6606.949s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6607.569s">So</a> we're doing awfully good somehow or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6610.051s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6612.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6614.789s">when</a> you look at these you do have to look at if you there so much uh studies have been done and information is sort of like uh the the uh level of uh of your socioeconomic and your economic standard throughout the city hey i know i know you're gonna you know you know more about your area right now and you can you know you can talk to me and i don't i don't know what you're talking about my point is
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6644.814s">And</a> for years and years and years, one of the things which has been so difficult for me is I see young families have leaving because they think there's a holy grail someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6653.716s">And</a> that's what I've worked for on this committee for all these years of saying that we've got it in Medford and we can do great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6660.317s">The</a> biggest difficulty is when we have a meeting, we discuss these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6665.682s">and</a> nobody shows up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6667.363s">And</a> so how do I get the information to you so that you can talk to your neighbors and friends about how we're getting out? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6676.706s">And</a> one of the things we did was, with great controversy, we just brought in a person to do publicity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6683.308s">Because</a> we understand that one of the biggest problems we have is there are so many good things happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6689.25s">If</a> you were here earlier, you saw one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6691.51s">But</a> getting it out is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6693.91s">The</a> publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6695.233s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6697.477s">What</a> was your question?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6701.244s">What</a> was the good thing?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6707.249s">Many</a> school systems have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6708.87s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6709.671s">Many</a> school systems have.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6712.993s">One</a> of the things that she does is she has a blog because we realize, I mean, how do we reach parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6719.256s">Well,</a> we have to do it with the way that parents are looking at media now, and that's through a blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6724.059s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6726.72s">You</a> know, the highlights of Medford is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6729.301s">Does</a> not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6730.501s">So</a> we are trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6731.282s">I</a> mean, we're trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6732.142s">The</a> communication is key.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6736.723s">Well,</a> I would look forward to talking to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6738.964s">I</a> didn't get your information, but I'd love to further conversation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6744.226s">P.</a> VanderKloof.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7405.043s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7405.263s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7406.604s">I</a> just want to mention that in terms on page three, where it gives the list of changes, there should be eight that a four-hour open house requirement once per season was added. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7426.896s">It</a> is added in the document, but it's just not added in that numerical list.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7435.661s">So</a> in the list that Anne-Marie just read on the third page, it's mentioned on the second page, but it's not included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7445.029s">The</a> following represents the changes made by the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7448.912s">So</a> that should be number eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7454.757s">So</a> if I could ask for a correction on that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7995.079s">I</a> was thinking about things like a birthday party is a good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8000.002s">If</a> all of a sudden it's canceled in the last 48 hours before, we can't go out and rent it again, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8007.467s">And</a> any other place where a parent would be going to have that kind of function would have a <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8015.012s">have</a> some kind of cancellation policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8020.157s">I</a> wasn't thinking about a field and it rains. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8023.541s">I</a> mean, that seems like a different sort of contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8027.024s">So,</a> again, how we define this in here, we might need to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8033.27s">But</a> if we have a theater group <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8035.386s">you</a> know, who's renting the Caron Theater, and all of a sudden they decide not to hold the performance, should we bear the entire cost of their cancellation, of their last minute cancellation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8047.069s">I</a> think any place where you go would expect some remuneration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8052.851s">Not</a> necessarily great, but some.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8084.667s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8086.048s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8086.649s">From</a> my reading of it is if we do a correction on number 2 on page 1 of 11 and say a non-refundable security deposit may be required upon acceptance of rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8099.089s">That,</a> right now, puts it in this document, and then if we need to be more specific in terms of which of the, if we want to spell out which of the, when we might require a... So it gets canceled within 48 hours of event?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8122.366s">to</a> prevent people from saying they were going to rent a place and then willy-nilly just turning around and not showing up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8135.957s">Well,</a> when we did it, we had done 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8138.939s">I</a> don't necessarily know if that's enough, but that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8144.684s">Mr.</a> Benedetto.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8383.16s">So</a> I just, since we're having that subcommittee, it would be a fine time to also discuss when we should require a non-refundable security deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8392.084s">And</a> I think it would be, we didn't have Mr. Maloney there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8395.466s">And</a> I think that would be very helpful to have that discussion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8465.61s">We</a> recognize that completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8467.011s">The</a> reason for putting in a statement which said Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by the Hormel Commission contact information is so that people who are looking online would get to that because they're trying to rent Hormel and they would see in our document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8481.193s">Oh,</a> so we just really put that as a direction so that you wouldn't be flooded with questions or that somebody would know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8489.335s">It</a> was really a courtesy quite honestly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9340.067s">What's</a> the projected cost?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9361.7s">I</a> know you were successful last year, and I'm sure that we'll see some of your fundraising that we can help support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9368.882s">I</a> would like to invite both students here to commend them for their achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9373.363s">That's</a> really fantastic.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9378.604s">It</a> may not.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9381.326s">We'll</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9382.847s">We'll</a> hope.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9568.402s">It's</a> terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9569.682s">Thank</a> you so much, Heidi. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9571.223s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.109s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.289s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.95s">So,</a> Heidi, I know you like a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10048.172s">And</a> this is a pretty great challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10049.893s">This</a> is fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10051.174s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10051.794s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10069.729s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10069.969s">Is</a> there a way that we can publicize that we're looking for, industry level? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10075.873s">I</a> mean, might there be other businesses you particularly want to attract?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10219.022s">So</a> one of my friends said to me, did you see the Times? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10222.784s">Did</a> you know that the Medford Vocational School is featured in it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10226.126s">Which</a> I didn't, and I still haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10228.427s">Do</a> you have a copy of the article? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10230.328s">Yes,</a> you have it actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10232.149s">I</a> could not find it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10237.112s">Uh-huh.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10770.109s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10770.289s">Vander</a> Kloof? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10771.751s">Amiya,</a> since you mentioned the PSAT funding, I just wanted to ask you, are the AP tests funded, are they, does guidance organize those, or are they organized by department?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10786.88s">And</a> do we provide any funding for AP students?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10807.052s">I</a> guess I'm a little concerned that for a student taking multiple, I heard my students talking about this, who I oversee, and they were talking about if they were taking multiple tests, if they're not on free or reduced lunch, it's just so expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10822.317s">And</a> somehow or another, I would really like to see some funding <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10826.338s">towards</a> AP exams, because I think that it's such a great thing for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10830.879s">We</a> like them doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10832.88s">But</a> the funding is prohibitive for a lot of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10836.841s">So</a> I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit more.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10931.169s">One</a> of the schools of the students told me that they pay for all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10934.872s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10935.173s">And</a> I was really impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10936.413s">So</a> anyway, I'd like to explore it a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10939.896s">I</a> know it's another budget item, but it's something we should think about.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11690.245s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11690.385s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11692.026s">I</a> just want to say that, of course, how wonderful all the concerts were. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11696.249s">They</a> really were outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11697.73s">Unfortunately,</a> the one I missed was the hand chime, but I think it's so great that we have that as an offering in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11705.735s">And,</a> you know, my hat is always off to Mr. Zigny and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11709.717s">Rello</a> and the other teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11712.159s">Perhaps</a> they're the luckiest teachers because we do see <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11715.225s">the</a> results of their work, but it was really outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11718.746s">And</a> of course, tonight was a great example of the work in our fine arts department.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12825.492s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12825.592s">van</a> de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12827.253s">So</a> this is just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12828.914s">I</a> should tell you that my daughter develops, works for a company which develops iOS apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12833.738s">And</a> so I, you know, I have firsthand experience of sort of knowing what an incredible career potential this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12841.803s">And</a> so I guess my biggest concern is after the grant ends, what we do, because this is something that we would like, I would like to see continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12851.21s">And</a> again, like you say, it's going to be very interesting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12855.052s">where</a> the kids who are being exposed now, where they go with it, and what they do at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12860.896s">So</a> I just want to commend you for all your work and thank you for your work on this project.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Httzg9o9WVA/2025-03-21_Httzg9o9WVA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - May 2, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=77.153s">I'd</a> like to ask to suspend the order of business so that we could take up items 1, 2, and 3 before we have the report of committees.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=382.279s">So</a> first, Mr. Coates, I heard that this was in the wind when I went to a historical meeting and society meeting, and I cannot believe how great the finished product looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=393.768s">Years</a> ago when I first started on the school committee, there was another book <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=399.195s">and</a> it was very weak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=400.896s">And</a> this is so wonderful, and the fact that you've included students in the, also highlighting some of the students, how proud they must be to be authors as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=413.423s">So</a> thank you for all of your dedication, for bringing Medford history to light, and for including our students so that they can look back and think about the time that they've been in a published author. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=425.329s">Mr.</a> Sloan, thank you for your generosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=427.79s">We</a> really appreciate your support of everything you do in Medford, and this is just a terrific testament to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=433.451s">Thank</a> you so much for being here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1058.947s">I</a> just wanna mention not only congratulations to this fine young lady on her achievement, but also as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1068.215s">Liu</a> slinks away, she was the, last week was the National Honor Society, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1075.181s">Liu</a> is the advisor for that club. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1077.162s">She</a> did such a lovely job, though she never wants to take any credit, so I'm outing her and saying thank you very much, Mrs. Liu, for your work with our students.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2356.956s">No,</a> I would actually prefer not to waive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2359.678s">It</a> was a very important subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2362.901s">It</a> was a great meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2364.735s">And</a> so, I'd like to review some of what we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2369.417s">So,</a> we called the meeting to order at 7.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2372.578s">In</a> attendance was myself, Mr. Iscari, Mrs. Mastone, and committee member, Erin DiBenedetto, who is not on the subcommittee, but joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2383.581s">Also</a> in attendance were Superintendent Belson, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2386.672s">Deputy</a> Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, and Director of Curriculum Bernadette Riccidelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2393.314s">In</a> addition, and most thankfully, I was very grateful that we had five parents who attended, Kate Carson, Michelle Ciccolo, Jennifer Lewis, Cheryl Rodriguez, and Ellery Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2405.297s">On</a> the agenda were three items, the park opt-out situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2409.689s">Then,</a> parent concerns regarding homework policy and practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2413.414s">And</a> lastly, the state accountability system and Medford performance, with specific discussion around the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2420.904s">Superintendent</a> explained the roles and rules governing the subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2425.89s">And</a> we began by talking about the state DESC guidance on opt-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2432.694s">Deputy</a> Superintendent Nelson provided a handout that identified the state's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2437.537s">And</a> I think that we're going to be updated with that later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2440.999s">And</a> so I'm going to skip down now to the part of the meeting where we talked about the parental concerns about the homework policy and practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2451.371s">Parent</a> Jen Lewis made an initial presentation, and there's items attached to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2458.517s">And</a> she raised issues of quantity, quality, and variation among teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2462.76s">There</a> were particular concern regarding homework in the early grades, and in fact, in kindergarten as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2468.785s">Also,</a> there were concerns about some teachers using homework as a punishment, which might include the loss of recess time for students not completing homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2478.722s">Parent</a> Kate Carson, a teacher herself, talked about the stress that homework places on young children and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2485.189s">And</a> she brought an exchange that she had with Tufts professor Martha Potts, speaking about homework and what really is the point of homework and how to have homework that's really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2500.933s">Parent</a> Michelle Chickalow felt that the nightly homework that her student was getting was too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2507.02s">Parent</a> Ellarie Klein said that the students showed that homework for early learners is not effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2513.588s">However,</a> parent Cheryl Rodriguez was more pro-homework and felt it played a valuable role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2520.19s">Assistant</a> Superintendent Diane Caldwell spoke to us and she said that the goal for homework was 10 minutes per grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2527.815s">In</a> kindergarten, maybe just reading with the student, but in first grade, 10 minutes, in second grade, 20, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2535.861s">And</a> it seemed like that was not consistent with the parents that we were hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2541.364s">And</a> so for the parent who was happier with the homework, it seemed like it fell within that reasonable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2549.94s">But</a> overall, parents talked about the stress of homework in their lives and saying that it became such a <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2558.603s">very</a> negative thing rather than a positive learning situation for their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2563.888s">You</a> note that I embellished that a little bit on our written minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2568.572s">Superintendent</a> Belson spoke on the need to be developmentally appropriate and that using homework as a punishment is not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2575.558s">He</a> emphasized that homework well done can be important, but that is not to be just a make work activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2582.083s">And</a> again, reference back to Diane Caldwell talking about the new K-2 program, which is going back to a more developmentally friendly classroom, which should include homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2593.91s">I</a> talked about our experience with homework from one particular teacher at the fifth grade level who had flexible homework, which was to say all the assignments needed to be done by a particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2607.394s">But</a> during the week, the student and family could pick which days they might spend time on homework, as long as it was done by a certain date. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2614.977s">And</a> that kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2616.225s">flexibility</a> in today's chaotic world for parents who are both coming home from work really, really would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2624.75s">The</a> committee will study the parent proposal and report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2628.412s">Meanwhile,</a> the administrators will reinforce best practices with our teaching faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2634.556s">The</a> meeting then moved to the topic of the state accountability system and the Medford performance in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2639.859s">There</a> was particular emphasis on the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2644.644s">Superintendent</a> began by saying that we should begin the review with the accountability status focusing on the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2653.029s">Medford</a> Public Schools has eight schools that are eligible for accountability ratings by DESC. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2659.132s">Only</a> one school has been designated as a Level 3 school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2661.893s">That</a> designation was one point below the Level 2 threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2665.882s">Medford</a> High School and the vocational school are both designated as level one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2669.948s">And</a> the superintendent goes on to give us some comparisons to neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2676.839s">For</a> example, Waltham Elementary, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2680.571s">Waltham</a> High, Woburn High, Quincy High, Peabody High, and Malden High are all level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2685.856s">And</a> if we look at elementary schools, many communities in Redding, Somerville, Waltham, Quincy, Framingham, for example, all fall in level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2695.704s">However,</a> that really was not what we were concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2698.807s">We</a> were concerned about trying to make sure that all of our students <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2703.576s">were</a> being educated in the best possible way and how we could improve because we are in the business of improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2714.62s">So</a> Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson made several points about the accountability system and Medford's performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2722.683s">And</a> then there was a discussion on the population distribution among the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2728.145s">The</a> superintendent pointed out that the Roberts had a substantial population of ELL newcomers <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2733.213s">However,</a> it would be difficult to move them to all other schools because of staffing concentrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2738.157s">And</a> also, we're not interested in just moving students around to improve score levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2742.74s">What</a> we're interested in is to make sure, again, that we're meeting the needs of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2748.745s">So</a> Assistant Superintendent Caldwell spoke on our current and planned interventions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2755.47s">For</a> current and past activities, we're mass supports in grades three, four, and five, and directors working with teachers to disaggregate data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2763.797s">Moving</a> forward, in ELL, we've got two more staff positions for growing ELL population, two paraprofessionals as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2773.584s">And</a> as you know, we have a very transient population where we have kids who arrive any time during the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2779.728s">But</a> moving forward, we discussed the hiring of two math coaches for the elementary schools for grades level two, three, and four, and to continue to work with DSAC for professional development opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2792.706s">Envision</a> our math program is going into the third year and we hope to see more positive results. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2797.971s">We're</a> going to intensify classroom review and have grade level meetings and it was suggested and confirmed that we would have more math nights at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2807.421s">The</a> discussion turned to the value of coaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2809.663s">Mr.</a> Benedetto had concerns about whether the coaches would be considered teacher evaluators and the answer was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2815.408s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2815.588s">Mistone</a> commented that coaching was not evaluative, and I spoke about coaches as being as models for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2825.051s">The</a> general finding was that the state DSAC was not providing real assistance, and they were short on answers, so it was a little frustrating, but we'll continue to work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2834.213s">The</a> subcommittee concluded that we have challenges ahead, but there were several concrete measures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2839.295s">The</a> meeting was adjourned with the understanding that we would come back for a further discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2844.836s">and</a> report on the homework policies.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2861.09s">Yeah,</a> I just want to again mention how valuable it was that the parents came and participated in the subcommittee meeting, and I was very grateful for that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3070.616s">It</a> was a great presentation the other day, and I was very honored to be able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3075.279s">I</a> think, you know, you can't help but feel proud when you realize that what we have in Medford is the goal for the rest of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3084.405s">And</a> that was very, very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3086.846s">That's,</a> you know, part of the reason why the speaker came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3090.343s">was</a> because we were being held up as the exemplary program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3094.486s">It</a> would be remiss if I did not happen to mention, since I'm old enough to remember, but the superintendent was key in developing the Medford Family Network, and it was through his work that it came into being.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3360.019s">I</a> just wanted to thank my colleagues, Irwin DiBenedetto and Bob Scurry, for their work on this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5015.939s">How</a> are we going to communicate it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5194.079s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5195.719s">I</a> noted where you said four pre-K students with complex medical needs registered in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5203.243s">Are</a> those students in the same classroom?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5240.743s">position</a> maintained in your budget for next year, so the two additional is on top of that, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5248.445s">It's</a> always amazing to me when I see the list of students, you know, 336 diagnosed with allergies, you know, the number with diabetes, the number with, you know, such complex medical needs, and know what great dedication your staff has to keep all the balls in the air safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5268.28s">It's</a> a juggling game sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5270.303s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5490.074s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5490.314s">Vander</a> Ploot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5491.455s">Personally,</a> I don't think it's good practice to have a meeting on Halloween.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5497.537s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5501.31s">Well,</a> no, because I believe that there are certain members who need to be home with their students, uh, their children and the other members who need to be at home giving out candy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5510.736s">So</a> if we could please, uh, look at the calendar again and change that October 31st meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6210.157s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6210.357s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6212.299s">I</a> am concerned about number eight, access to the main school building should be limited to emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6218.985s">That</a> assumes that someone's going to have a key or to the main school building.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6262.89s">But</a> doesn't that put a responsibility on us to always have someone in the high school who can open it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6267.971s">I</a> mean, I think it's clearer if there is no access to the school facility.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6281.674s">Well,</a> to me, it's clearer because if we put in except limited to emergencies, it seems that it puts on to us a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6291.24s">And</a> I think the responsibility has to be with the people who are operating the facility to use our emergency in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6303.55s">Also,</a> you did not include, we talked about provisions for snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6314.859s">Because</a> my concern was that all of a sudden there'll be pressure <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6318.978s">for</a> us to do snow removal when our snow plows are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6328.042s">So</a> I've written this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6331.464s">The</a> facility will be closed during snow days unless the vendor arranges snow removal acceptable to the school department.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6352.341s">But</a> it's not always clear, because sometimes it takes us two or three or four days.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6369.384s">We</a> could replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6370.025s">The</a> facility may be closed during snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6372.646s">But</a> also what I'm saying is, hey, if you want it open, then you pay for the snow removal.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6383.551s">On</a> school cancellation days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6385.072s">I</a> mean, we talked about it last weekend, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6387.893s">So</a> the facility may be closed during snow emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6392.746s">unless</a> the vendor arranges snow removal acceptable to the Medford School Department.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6828.541s">I</a> just want to make sure, because it's very crowded at that time, the lots were fully used, and in fact, I was driving around looking for a parking space for quite a while, that in that case, and I'm certainly assuming that a Saturday morning would be a very popular time to use this facility, that that <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6849.997s">lot</a> in the back that the vendor is using the 100 cars would be for the vendor's use during that period of time, and that there would be no conflict with our existing contract with the Japanese language school.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6895.15s">I</a> just have one further question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6897.072s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6898.613s">What</a> is the date of the meeting for us to discuss community schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6902.737s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6903.458s">What</a> is the date of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6904.919s">It's</a> the 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6907.762s">May</a> 9th, which is next? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6910.965s">May</a> 9th, OK.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7601.445s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7602.326s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7602.586s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7602.766s">Vanden</a> Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7604.087s">I</a> was just thinking that it would be very helpful if the superintendent sent to members a draft, his next draft, rather than waiting until May 16th, because there may be edits that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7619.56s">And</a> if we wait all the way until the 16th, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7623.302s">I'm</a> afraid that we'll be at a meeting like this where we're sort of saying, you forgot this or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7629.167s">So</a> I'm not quite sure how to do it, but I think it would be advantageous to see it in between.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7677.958s">But</a> on the other hand, we could communicate directly with you one-on-one.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7683.36s">On</a> the other hand, we could give you feedback directly one-on-one.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8034.15s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8034.31s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8035.05s">Um,</a> I note that they have not updated the change of our esteemed mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8040.715s">And</a> so perhaps one, somebody should communicate with them about, sorry, it's listed as mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8048.733s">They</a> haven't updated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8050.016s">I'll</a> talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8050.898s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_b-cJrtai7oA/2025-03-21_b-cJrtai7oA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Apr. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=132.385s">The</a> superintendent, it was my understanding that at some point there was some money that was put aside for art projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=138.729s">Um,</a> and this would seem, uh, without knowing too much about it, uh, uh, to be the perfect candidate, uh, for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=146.115s">Um,</a> so I wonder if you could, uh, let us know how, uh, the PTO, uh, the Roberts could go about getting this, this, uh, project funded.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=166.114s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that after review by the superintendent that the funds be appropriated for this project at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=177.658s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=457.244s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=458.045s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=458.285s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=459.546s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to ask one question about the timing of this project again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=465.89s">When</a> were you hoping to do it with the kids?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=480.505s">So</a> this means if the committee approves my motion that the superintendent needs to review as quickly as possible so that we can put this on the fast track.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=936.629s">Dr.</a> Perrella, we, the school committee, were concerned and expressed our concern about the possibility of some students being very nervous once they were informed or uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=946.332s">And</a> I am curious whether, in fact, any parents came up to get students, and these students expressed the desire to go home, or whether any students were particularly bothered by this information and how you followed up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1004.489s">Great,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2005.563s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2005.703s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2007.444s">Sam,</a> I was just curious about how many classrooms come to visit the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2013.849s">I</a> know that my daughters receive library cards when they came in that we had to sign in advance and they went down to the library and they were all so excited and they came home with their library card. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2025.838s">So</a> how many, you know, is there schools who send all their first graders or <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2032.408s">Well,</a> how does it exist now?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2065.972s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2066.353s">And</a> probably, I mean, part of it always is the cost of transportation, the buses, but it would seem that it might make a whole lot of sense, and again, it's just the cost of the transportation, but to do a drive, I mean, there's been some good suggestions here about other ways to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2085.212s">I</a> think that there is value in getting the kid actually into the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2089.396s">and</a> having you talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2091.937s">So</a> I think that I'd like to also throw about and discuss the possibility of making it consistent, like in the fifth grade, all the fifth graders go <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2104.481s">on</a> some field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2105.442s">Well,</a> maybe this should be the field trip for all the kindergartners or first graders or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2110.187s">So</a> I just want to think about that as a potential, too, so that it's not just this kid at this school, but this is one of the things that the Medford public schools do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2120.818s">All</a> kids are going to go to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2122.239s">visit</a> the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2123.96s">And</a> I, of course, am understanding your timing, you know, before the summer, so that they've got the resources during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2130.424s">We</a> might not be able to get all of those kids to do it, but maybe if we look at that towards the future, it would make a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2136.528s">Lastly,</a> Sam, I just would like to thank you for your incredible energy and enthusiasm that you bring to everything that you do at the library.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2749.079s">I</a> don't know where we could get funds for that, but thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2753.463s">A</a> couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2754.364s">I</a> couldn't quite figure out what the cost of the trip would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2758.088s">It's</a> around $4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2758.548s">It's</a> expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2761.35s">And</a> also, I was curious, last time you went to both Italy and France. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2768.315s">This</a> time you're doing a more in-depth trip in Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2771.857s">Was</a> there any particular reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2773.218s">Was</a> that because of political concerns?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3356.838s">I'm</a> wondering, Anne, whether in your award you were awarded money to help cover the cost of your travel to Arizona.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3376.906s">By</a> the way, my daughter went to WPI, and she absolutely loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3380.547s">Great</a> place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3381.407s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3382.148s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3382.388s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3447.245s">to</a> the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3448.046s">We</a> just want to be in the picture so that when she wins the Nobel Prize, we can say we remember when. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3554.79s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3558.863s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3562.397s">It's</a> also remarkable that so many of our students did well getting into the top 43 and being recognized with cash rewards. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3571.24s">We</a> met many of these students earlier, but it certainly would make sense for us to send out to them a letter of congratulations from the school committee for their achievement at the regional science fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3583.323s">I</a> remember going many years ago, and to have this many Medford students is definitely a very welcome sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3590.852s">Congratulations,</a> Mr. Seery.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4199.705s">You</a> know, I'm somewhat taken aback only because I didn't quite realize that was, I didn't quite grasp that it has been, will not, and in the past, the most difficult, one of the most difficult days of my life was the day when some sweet young ladies called me and they were going to be removed from social probation and not being able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4224.175s">And</a> one of the problems, of course, is that they were sweet young ladies with much less body weight than their male counterparts, but they were not allowed to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4233.818s">And</a> at the time, the principal, Dr. Kruger, headmaster Dr. Kruger said, you know, Paulette, I'd much rather have you have a hard time doing this than having to go to a funeral. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4245.481s">And</a> that was pretty, you know, what could you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4251.442s">My</a> concern here with this is that, of course, we're coming up to that time when we all get very nervous because there's so many events for our students, which traditionally we've done very, very well in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4265.37s">But</a> since Dr. Perel is here, just to please ask him to remind the students that this is a very important time in their lives for our seniors who are coming up and that they would not want to have a blight, even with <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4279.477s">You</a> know, now if we're saying, well, we're going to be a little bit more thoughtful about giving out the punishment of will not attend graduation for the students we want them, we don't want it to even be a question for them to have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4296.192s">So</a> it's just so important and so very difficult for families if a child is not able to attend graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4302.978s">So</a> I don't want to even think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4304.239s">I</a> want them to go smoothly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4983.596s">You</a> know, I think many of us have worked with Anne over the years and she has really is distinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4989.302s">I</a> mean, we have many, many parents who volunteer for long periods of time, but Anne has put so much energy into that up all night party and is <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4997.149s">really</a> stands out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4998.21s">I</a> remember there was one year when she actually had a hiatus, I think, between children for a year, but it didn't stop her at all from making sure that that group of kids in between, before her next child entered into ninth grade, was well taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5013.165s">I</a> think that she definitely is deserving of an honor, and if we would ask her, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5019.851s">We</a> have other parents on stage, the parents of the valedictorian, the salutatorian, and the student from the vocational school, so we probably could fit two more seats up there.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5564.129s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5564.949s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5566.97s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5568.251s">This</a> year we were blessed because of a warmer winter to have savings, just as many of us were at home too. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5575.453s">I</a> noticed that our bills were down as well, almost comparatively to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5580.934s">But</a> it's just that when we're planning for next year, we have to remember not this winter, but the winter before, just to make sure that when we do our budget sessions, we're not the incredibly optimistic, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5595.718s">of</a> this year, but we are realistic to the year before. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5598.781s">So</a> I'm just mindful of that because it looks so good this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5603.586s">On</a> the food service, I just want to, I think, reiterate that of the $88,000 surplus, that that money then is taken and will fold over into <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5614.117s">needed</a> upgrades of different things in our food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5619.619s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5620.159s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5621.08s">Because</a> I think that's very important for people to realize, because if you say 88,000 surplus, then you're asking, oh, why did we raise the cost of lunch? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5628.862s">We</a> raised it because we need to cover, it's a self-funding program, and it needs to cover other necessary items. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5638.305s">And</a> that's the way we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5640.066s">So</a> while it's a <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5643.208s">that</a> money was generated because there are expenses that need to be paid out of that money to keep us in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5652.319s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5652.88s">That</a> is correct.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5675.377s">Yes,</a> it sounds like he has some great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5677.519s">I</a> am also glad to see in the report that you attached that we're going to be able to continue the food service program during the summer that we began last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5685.884s">So</a> thank you very much, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5687.085s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5823.938s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5824.098s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5824.578s">I</a> was just wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5825.779s">I</a> noticed that Mrs. DiCarlo is here, and we received a report on our desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5831.463s">Perhaps</a> before we go on to the lead counsel in school rentals, we might want to turn to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5836.866s">Are</a> you presenting this tonight?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5844.157s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5845.898s">We</a> received in our packet a wonderful, this is more good news, Medford High School students of Italian win first prize in contest at Northeastern University. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5857.404s">Do</a> you want to take over?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6015.163s">Mrs.</a> DeCarlo, you missed the best line, though, which is Medford High School won first place, Lexington High School won second place, and Everett High School won third place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6028.366s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6673.772s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6675.873s">I</a> would put in a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6679.356s">Because</a> I sat on the committee that was going through the policy handbook, I need to, just for those of you who weren't there, to tell you it was an extraordinarily arduous task. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6691.326s">We</a> met night after night after night with Jim Hardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6694.749s">going</a> through all of these different policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6698.211s">And</a> when you see SOURCE, M-A-S-C, those were ones that he brought along and said, this is the M-A-S-C policy that many school districts have adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6712.845s">When</a> Jim went to that place, and we posted this, since we had worked on this for so long, and it was finally time to post it, it's very clear to me now, looking backwards, that this must have just been set aside, probably to go to the subcommittee, and it was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6729.468s">So</a> I think to answer your question, Mrs. DiBenedo, is that unfortunately the two MASC policies would be, in my recollection, ones that Jim brought in for our <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6741.19s">purview,</a> and the other ones were ones that we found in our paperwork that had existed over some period of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6748.413s">What</a> the superintendent is recommending, and is clearly the logical thing to do, is now to sit down, take a look at all four, and develop our own, along with the fee structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6758.517s">I</a> will note that Mrs. DiBenedetto and I were able to attend Fiddler on the Roof this past week. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6764.579s">It</a> was excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6765.639s">We</a> really had a very enjoyable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6767.8s">But</a> afterwards it was, when we had a discussion with one of the teachers, it was clear that they had had to work around a rental that took place the previous weekend, which, to an outside vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6779.489s">And</a> that didn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6781.11s">Our</a> kids needed that space to be able to prepare for their yearly spring musical. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6786.814s">And</a> we were both disheartened to hear that that had happened, because I think that the committee as a whole is of the priority that our Medford High School kids take first priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6797.462s">So</a> it would seem that this would be the logical thing to now send to a subcommittee and work out a new policy and a new fee structure and then finally be able to post this as our new policy.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7099.765s">I</a> was just simply going to say that I did not think that we needed a motion because we had already had a motion earlier for all the things that Mrs. DiBenedetto mentioned, and I think we're all in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7110.414s">Also,</a> in the report that the superintendent gave us, it says very clearly we have been working on a new policy and free structure since our last committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7118.981s">We</a> would expect to have it ready for your review by the first meeting in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7122.905s">Any</a> new policy should be carefully studied and approved for the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7125.887s">So</a> I definitely believe we're on the right track and appreciate the Attorney Greenspan for coming out tonight.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7166.869s">So,</a> which organizations exactly? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7170.272s">Our</a> Medford Little League, Babe Ruth, and our softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7173.776s">With</a> the fee structure or not?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7554.947s">it</a> would be appropriate to add an amendment on to the main motion that, and I forget the exact wording of the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7563.835s">Okay,</a> but that the superintendent will follow up with the organizations to make sure that adequate supervision and custodial services and insurance will cover, are in place.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8010.811s">But</a> if you want to send that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8012.573s">The</a> motion with the amendment had to do with the outside groups using the cages for the next short period of time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8051.406s">A</a> further one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8051.906s">And</a> we have a citizen who's been waiting to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8054.568s">Are</a> you wanting to speak on this?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8711.77s">I</a> certainly understand what you're saying, um, Mr. Superintendent, but the only concern I have is that our May 2nd meeting is three weeks off. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8719.314s">So</a> in three weeks off, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8720.815s">you</a> know, right now, I mean, part of the, I think that part of the intent initially was that you go on record and you say, at least for the, the intent of the motion would be that we're against any legislation that raises the current <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8738.405s">current</a> cap on charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8741.246s">And</a> then secondarily, we are for full funding of the foundation budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8746.626s">I</a> really think that that's what it comes down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8748.847s">I'm</a> just concerned that we're now talking about saying you're going to bring us back something in three weeks after the debate is all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8755.988s">Perhaps</a> it would make more sense to, and you know, I don't know whether what the vote of this committee would be on those two very simply put items. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8766.97s">Because</a> I put it very simply.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8776.335s">Right,</a> we still happen to have vacation week in between this then.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8808.642s">Okay,</a> well, we obviously all can still talk to our legislators separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8814.425s">So</a> I think that bringing it forth to us the week sooner at the Committee of the Whole would make a lot of sense.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_jdwHjtwlKYA/2025-03-21_jdwHjtwlKYA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Mar. 28, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=955.512s">So</a> thank you, Ann Marie, for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=958.434s">That</a> makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=959.475s">So</a> technically, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to vote on it, but if my colleague wants to vote on it, there's no reason not to just vote on it and take it off, get it off our deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=969.523s">So</a> I'll second her motion so we vote on it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=992.431s">I</a> had a question.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=994.611s">So</a> at this point, our principals have all been informed about how they should respond to a parent who requests that their child should not take the test.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1026.102s">Bernadette,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1027.462s">I</a> just, I guess, I just want to make sure that if a family does come forward and not want their child to take the test, that it's handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1034.485s">And</a> I did appreciate the line, you know, with sensitivity, so that neither the parent or the child is made to feel guilty about their choice not to take the test.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1053.632s">Do</a> parents need to put it in writing that they don't want their child to take the test?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1102.239s">OK,</a> we don't have a form that they sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1107.041s">So</a> I understand how important it is and we encourage parents to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1111.985s">I</a> also understand all the arguments of the opt-out people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1116.468s">So</a> I just want to make sure that students and that it is handled appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1121.332s">And</a> I would also like this committee to receive <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1125.775s">after</a> the testing cycle is done, obviously not names, but simply numbers at each school, if there are opt-outs at the schools, if we could receive a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1138.581s">And</a> at grade levels, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1142.983s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1748.008s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1748.188s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1749.309s">So,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1750.15s">Rich</a> here, once again, you have brought us to the point where you have just pushed us forward and now have us... <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1757.738s">headed</a> into a direction for the future of our students and the well-being of them and what we offer in Medford or the possibilities of what we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1768.302s">Obviously,</a> this is just the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1770.343s">First,</a> a technical question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1772.063s">When</a> do you have to file this statement of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1776.945s">What's</a> the first deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1778.986s">April</a> 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1781.347s">And</a> could you need our approval on saying, yes, we're interested in moving forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1787.189s">There</a> is no, obviously, no dollar amount or anything at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1791.534s">It's</a> just simply we're interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1795.438s">And</a> what is the next step?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1819.318s">Does</a> this need to go before the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1821.779s">Eventually.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1822.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1823.4s">Eventually,</a> but not before the letter of intent on April 10th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1865.487s">But</a> right now, simply for tonight and to be able to move on, it's just, we can vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1871.028s">And</a> so I make a recommendation, a motion to approve.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2676.654s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2676.974s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2679.321s">No,</a> I just wanted to express my thanks to Heidi once again for bringing forth our report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2685.646s">I</a> think that the proposal from Mr. Biglioni sort of almost goes outside of the school committee purview at this time, because right now our project and our sites are really looking forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2699.358s">what</a> we're doing at the school and the educational benefits to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2703.381s">And</a> I don't want to throw something together even if it has merit that we're not really quite ready to do at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2714.13s">know</a> how quickly the rest of the school year will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2717.611s">And</a> while I know it's been very, very frustrating for you and many in the community who are looking forward to a broader access TV, I think that, you know, I'm really putting, I want to put my eggs in this basket right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2734.777s">Again,</a> I don't know because there's a lot of things I simply don't know about the proposal, how much a van would cost, who would drive the van, all of those sorts of issues, and I think that goes actually beyond us right at the moment.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_S2_JZKlpB_Y/2025-03-21_S2_JZKlpB_Y.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Mar. 8, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4573.803s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4574.003s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4575.664s">So</a> I've been thinking about this since our last meeting, and there's just, there's a phrase which I find awkward, I guess, and that is non-public safety personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4586.13s">Now,</a> maybe it's one that's used all the time, but I wondered, like, when I read the sentence, I was, I just kept on playing with it and saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4595.035s">just</a> feel right, can you write the sentence a different way and say the school environment is sealed off from the public and only appropriately public safety personnel be able to enter until the situation is stabilized? <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4607.227s">What</a> was the term you wanted to use? <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4609.382s">And</a> then the second, so the school environment is sealed off from the public, and only appropriate safety personnel, designated safety personnel, will be able to enter until the situation is stabilized.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4624.633s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4629.879s">So</a> safety personnel.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4631.86s">And</a> in this, in the second one, it says no non-public safety personnel can enter the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4637.184s">And</a> it would make more sense to say only public safety personnel can enter the building.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=4645.89s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=5156.702s">I</a> would be comfortable postponing it, either doing it earlier to the 14th or putting it off for a week to the 28th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=5179.635s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=5188.365s">So</a> I make a motion that we move it to the 28th?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1059.241s">Yes,</a> there was a parent in the audience who had written us, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1063.003s">Valdez.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1821.403s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1821.583s">Van</a> de Vliet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1822.724s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1824.265s">So</a> when a student goes on a trip like that, there is a risk, and the risk is that it's canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1830.509s">And</a> it is fairly clear in the policy that 75% would be refunded from the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1839.835s">However,</a> on the evening that this happened, I remember distinctly that the tone was definitely that we would try and work something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1847.962s">And</a> again, part of it, as my colleague alludes to, was definitely something for the kids because of their excitement and interest in wanting to undertake this activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1858.27s">But</a> there is the other piece of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1860.843s">Personally,</a> I don't think that we can refund the whole thing from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1866.066s">I</a> actually don't think it would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1867.667s">I</a> do think that if I were looking at it in addition to whatever we do, I would be inclined to at least refund $100 to each parent, possibly $115, which would be half of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1881.535s">And</a> then it needs to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1884.016s">And</a> the reason I would do that is because it's never happened before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1887.218s">It's</a> never happened since I've sat on this school committee that I remember that we had a similar case, certainly which involved as many students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1896.935s">However,</a> I think it's one of those things where <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1900.314s">the</a> parent knows that they're taking somewhat of a risk, and so we're sharing the risk, if you would. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1904.998s">Gives</a> people back a little bit of money, certainly shows good faith on our part, but then becomes a very clear precedent of saying, you know, in the future, if trips are canceled, the only money which is, I mean, refunded will be the 75 percent from the company, because now we have such a clear indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1926.477s">My</a> thinking would be, and I'm not going to make it a motion yet because I know other people might have other thinking, but my thinking right now is that I would recommend to refund 100 or 115, I don't know which, whatever my colleagues think, and split the difference between us and the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1946.37s">And</a> in addition, we would like to see, I'm just sure that if there was an event locally, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1953.955s">You</a> know, it's not like we're saying that money covers the cost of the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1957.517s">We're</a> trying to put together an event with other people just to, so the kids have an opportunity to talk to other people in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1966.781s">Any</a> thoughts?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1973.244s">I</a> guess, let's say half, 115.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2648.057s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2648.257s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2649.418s">I</a> think that it makes sense to go ahead and vote on this tonight and not hold it, because I think it would be a wonderful thing for the kids to go down to the day on the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2659.473s">it's</a> certainly not going to cost that much for a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2663.614s">And</a> if it is there a bus, I think that's something that, you know, the school department can cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2668.736s">So</a> I would ask that we go ahead and vote for the refund to the parents and while at the same time trying to ensure the kids have that opportunity.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2733.47s">In</a> a past event, I had the opportunity, as did the mayor, to attend on Friday morning the high school candidates forum, where our students portrayed the different candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2746.94s">It</a> was so exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2748.321s">I</a> really wish all of you had been able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2750.503s">And</a> again, it was just one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2751.904s">The</a> kids did such a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2755.228s">members</a> from the League of Women Voters there, and I kept on glancing over at them as they were historically falling off their seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2762.172s">The</a> kids did such a great job impersonating, knowing the candidates' positions, and going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2768.815s">And</a> of course, it's been such a highly unusual year in some ways that it certainly lent itself to a fabulous presentation, and our students just did us really proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2779.941s">It</a> was a lot of fun.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3166.818s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3166.999s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3168.079s">Is</a> there parking set aside at each of the elementary schools for voters?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3196.187s">So</a> where will voters park? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3199.889s">Usually</a> people vote park <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3204.13s">There's</a> a stretch along the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3205.972s">That</a> will be open?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3209.475s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3209.795s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3210.375s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4089.741s">I</a> did because, you know, it doesn't surprise us because Pat goes above and beyond for everything she does. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4093.942s">We're</a> very, very lucky.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5242.427s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5243.844s">Um,</a> so the superintendent alluded to the fact that in fact, in the fall, there were other concerns, a concern about a group using the McGlynn on weekends and also posting pictures of the McGlynn auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5257.112s">And</a> at that point we raised this issue and it was simply because of the timing of the election and whatever that it was put off, but it's definitely time that we take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5266.377s">It's</a> not just about the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5267.778s">It's</a> about the entire, uh, uh, process of, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5272.905s">school</a> facilities being used by outside groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5276.909s">And,</a> you know, it's just to be clear, we have had in the past contracts and rates and everything else set up in the past very clearly demarcated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5288.819s">I</a> sat on those committees for years, but clearly something is not now being utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5296.445s">So</a> I think this needs to be a committee of the whole, the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5300.371s">And</a> I would ask, I certainly would support Erin's amendments, if you might repeat them, but I think that we're all on the same page that this is something we absolutely need to look at sooner rather than later.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nRt_3AXXILY/2025-03-21_nRt_3AXXILY.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Feb. 1, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1255.306s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1256.867s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1258.108s">The</a> first thing is there's so many wonderful different activities here, but I was concerned because when I looked at these I thought of a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1266.092s">a</a> group of very motivated students who would be interested in these. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1270.675s">How</a> are we making sure that we're outreaching to other students and widening the circle?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1284.562s">Do</a> we have any idea how many kids have participated?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1295.713s">That's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1297.134s">And</a> the other thing on this symposium, which is taking place, it says there's limited spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1303.7s">Is</a> that limited by the number of people who could fit into the little theater?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1322.555s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1324.577s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1783.618s">Mr.</a> Scorger, thank you for all of your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1786.98s">One</a> of the things which I know is that doing an event like this takes a lot of work, and turning out people is not always <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1794.967s">the</a> easiest thing because there's always so many different other commitments that people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1800.312s">Are</a> you releasing this to the different Rotary and different groups in town? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1806.136s">And</a> I'm just wondering what your outreach is.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1852.731s">That's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1854.411s">I</a> also was wondering whether teachers who attend would be eligible for a PDP point or is there any way? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1861.813s">I</a> can't do that.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1906.602s">And</a> we do have the paper present. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1909.265s">And</a> I do think doing the robocalls really does let people know in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1913.849s">So</a> thank you very much for all your effort and that goes as well to the students.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3457.742s">If</a> we were going to do that, I'd much prefer it to be at a committee of the whole and a different, this environment is not conducive to the sort of data analysis that we would need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3470.751s">So</a> I would suggest a committee of the whole if we were to go that path.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3992.418s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3994.119s">I'm</a> too troubled by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3995.959s">Partly</a> my biggest concern is how does it, how is it going to be interpreted by the parents of the Roberts? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4002.888s">because</a> as a parent of the Roberts, I would assume that, you know, it would be, it's very complex information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4009.694s">We</a> sound as if, you know, we're trying to make excuses because after all, this is the, you know, report we're getting, but we understand all the technicalities involved, but that's hard to translate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4024.826s">And</a> so I would, I know that a letter needs to go out to the parents of the Roberts, and I just hope that that is well crafted and that, <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4032.628s">If</a> there needs to be subsequent meetings with the parents to reassure them, that you will obviously do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4038.47s">I</a> have no doubt that you will.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4055.38s">Will</a> you let us know when that's going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4057.462s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4060.584s">Again,</a> totally concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4063.147s">Does</a> this rating now stand for two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4065.629s">Is</a> there still a two-year cycle that there used to be?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4085.411s">And</a> the other concern, of course, is the one you mentioned about the cohorts of the number of kids changing and that a child can be in multiple cohorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4092.883s">If</a> you have a child who's truly struggling, that means, you know, if there's only 20 kids, that's a significant change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4099.525s">And,</a> you know, if you have one or two kids, that is going to change your numbers significantly.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4518.582s">By</a> the way, I just want to mention that last week I did have the opportunity to go visit two of the kindergarten classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4523.827s">It</a> was a wonderful experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4525.249s">I</a> walked through the building as well and talked and stopped and talked to a couple of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4529.527s">I</a> saw the students working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4532.831s">I</a> was at the kindergarten classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4534.293s">I</a> think the most interesting thing, again, they were very much similar to classes that I was used to when my children attended at the Hervey, except that there was a higher caliber <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4546.947s">of</a> learning going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4548.988s">When</a> we hear kindergarten is more like first grade, I saw that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4553.029s">I</a> saw the material that they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4555.89s">And</a> it was just both teachers who I visited who had been here one night, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4561.171s">Goss</a> and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4561.712s">Skiffington,</a> and the whole experience was so wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4565.653s">I</a> do hope that the other <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4567.043s">ones</a> of you who can take advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4570.125s">And</a> you don't want to be disruptive in the classroom, but if you get a chance to go in, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4576.15s">And</a> by chance, I was at the Roberts, and I went into an ELL classroom where it was just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4583.316s">So</a> it's funny that the words of the superintendent saying, there's an awful lot of good things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4591.122s">And</a> when I was there personally, I saw those good things going on.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4859.799s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4859.98s">Van</a> de Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4860.681s">I</a> just want to mention, I didn't get to it this year because I had gone two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4864.065s">Um,</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4865.788s">You</a> know, it's funny, sometimes I catch myself being distracted, and I visualize that pink wristband. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4871.032s">So</a> even two years after, that program has an impact on me, an adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4876.596s">So</a> it's really excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4878.217s">It's</a> on my dashboard.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6247.643s">The</a> other question I have is within, obviously, we have some great programs and expansion of our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6254.145s">You've</a> just indicated that Waltham is doing the same with themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6262.148s">Is</a> there, yet somehow Minuteman has managed to say, yes, there is a need for our school, a continuous need. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6272.014s">Is</a> there, within Massachusetts and the other vocational schools, more capacity so that students could be absorbed in a different way?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6503.838s">Motion</a> to accept and place on file.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6712.711s">Madam</a> Mayor, we do not have the costs associated with the... <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6718.727s">We</a> do, okay.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U/2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 25, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=838.883s">Have</a> you got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=839.423s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=841.965s">You're</a> being presented with $1,700.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1245.898s">Just</a> hold it for a minute.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1881.713s">While</a> I was not able to go this year, I did attend last year, and altogether this year there were 20 Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1887.437s">And</a> I know last year when the kids spoke, it just blew everybody away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1891.78s">And</a> I happen to know one of these students, and he's such a fabulous kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1896.543s">And</a> these are the sorts of things which, again, makes Medford awfully proud when our students go out and speak like this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2687.102s">So</a> I'm really anticipating my visit tomorrow morning with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2692.245s">I</a> have to tell you that interestingly, way back when, when we had the Hervey Developmental School, this reminds me very, very, very much of what my students, my own kids had at the Hervey for developmental education. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2706.211s">In</a> fact, one of the greatest differences actually is when I got to the last page and I saw some <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2711.353s">emphasis</a> on phonics, which is one thing they didn't do particularly well back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2715.455s">But</a> the small group and like you said, you know, the kids doing the most amazing projects and working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2721.378s">It's</a> a joy and I'm really anticipating seeing your classrooms tomorrow.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3009.233s">Thank</a> you for being here.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3012.574s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5042.485s">Madam</a> Mayor, at this though, it looks like the first opportunity is April 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5050.872s">Is</a> that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5055.156s">For,</a> on the yellow flyer, building bridges to kindergarten.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5080.72s">So,</a> again, when I heard parents talking, they were asking it for earlier because they were trying to make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5088.125s">And</a> so, for me, April, that late in April actually feels late because they wanted it
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5119.215s">I'm</a> just saying we can't do that session any earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5121.436s">We</a> can't do another one earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5124.178s">I'm</a> not sure about that, but I can check for you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5563.494s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5564.474s">Um,</a> I was wondering if perhaps what we might do is invite our, uh, legislators to our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5571.295s">We</a> always have to be careful to avoid, um, uh, not having the open meeting law honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5578.457s">And</a> so all of us might like to go on Thursday night, but we can't because of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5582.938s">Um,</a> and so perhaps, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5585.803s">As</a> a follow up, it would make a whole lot of sense to sit down with our legislators as a committee and follow up on those items which are important, not just to one member, but to all of us.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5656.748s">So</a> I think I'd like to put that in the form of a motion that we have a set up a meeting with our legislators so that the committee as a whole can sit down and speak with them about our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5668.432s">Just</a> one follow up to your thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5670.293s">Of</a> course, the governor also has a strong liking of charter schools, which is difficult for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5677.395s">And</a> I think that's extremely important that we're always making the distinction of an <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5682.77s">and</a> explaining our concerns, why that's problematical for the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5688.436s">And</a> I think we stand, you know, to really say these are our strengths, look what we're doing here, look what our vocational school is, look at our class sizes, look what we're doing, because this, you know, when you listen to the charter school proponents, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5703.456s">While,</a> of course, there were some charter schools that perhaps are strong, they certainly are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5708.781s">And</a> I believe that is the cornerstone of the great values of this country is public education for all kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5716.908s">And</a> I don't define that as having a dual system of education.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5790.995s">So</a> charter schools are public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5794.098s">I</a> also noted it was a dual system of education.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7962.111s">Pat,</a> I just had a question about the school breakfast expansion grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7966.173s">So</a> I see a decrease for fiscal year 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7970.275s">How</a> is that going to impact our school breakfast programs?

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=167.895s">Motion</a> of approval.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=560.121s">It's</a> the last page on the motion.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=568.029s">Mr.</a> Mayor, I just wanted to say, I think this is a terrific thing for us to be doing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=898.349s">Yeah,</a> I kind of think it's sort of neat in a way just because it brings the two communities together as our, you know, arch rival on the football field at Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=907.493s">But</a> I do have the concerns of making sure and I'm glad it's going to be revisited yearly to see whether it works.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3014.349s">So,</a> I liken this to a shell game, and I agree with my colleagues, because, you see, I think Mr. Chester must be laughing all the way, oh, we don't want, they don't want the park, okay, so we'll call it MCAS 2.0, and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3032.663s">The</a> big question is, what money were they getting before, was PARC getting before, and what money are they getting now? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3038.548s">I</a> sort of figure that it's probably they're doing just as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3042.171s">I</a> hate tricky questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3044.012s">I</a> think the math question, when you look at the math question, that's a tricky question, because obviously if a student looks at it, they're going to see two different lengths and lines, so you can fall for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3053.519s">So</a> what we're going to be educating our children is not to fall for a tricky question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3058.984s">So</a> which goes beyond just understanding the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3061.605s">It</a> goes beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3062.346s">It</a> means don't fall for a tricky question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3066.389s">And</a> so we'll spend a lot of time now teaching them how to answer these questions rather than, I think, doing what our real mission in education should be, is educating a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3079.751s">about</a> and fostering a level of learning and not just simply preparing them for a test. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3084.857s">It</a> is not to say that, of course, these are things that students need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3088.362s">They</a> need to know fractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3089.483s">They</a> need to know how to compare fractions, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3092.627s">But</a> there's a way to do that with <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3095.529s">out,</a> making it a tricky question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3097.651s">We</a> have, I think, no choice, because, by the way, if I want to make a prediction, I'm going to predict that the school districts who did park last year are going to magically do better the second time around than the school districts who are doing them for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3114.707s">Mark</a> my words, guys, that's the way it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3117.31s">We</a> have no choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3118.751s">We</a> need to do this.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4224.822s">Mr.</a> Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4226.751s">I</a> had a question about utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4231.653s">So</a> on this, my question was that it seems like there's quite an increase, and you mentioned that it's partly because of the warmer weather, but also that the pool was open two additional months. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4243.436s">How</a> much of the increase does that, if it was a 76.6 thousand increase, how much does the pool <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4252.614s">account</a> for?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4262.623s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4262.843s">I</a> mean, just because it is, you know, 76,000 is significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4265.886s">Now</a> I see that it's offset a little bit by the savings so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4269.889s">Um,</a> but you know, it definitely is a concern given that there was no price increase.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4688.184s">I'm</a> just saying that I just want to remind you that it's already been requested to Erin, because earlier this fall, I very specifically went and spoke and asked for the same information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4699.87s">And</a> I think the superintendent is saying that he would get to us at the beginning of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4705.132s">I</a> certainly don't want it to wait until March. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4707.393s">I</a> know, but I want to have a meeting regarding it and know everything.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=5166.092s">I</a> haven't seen them yet.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=855.796s">I</a> had the opportunity to see the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=858.038s">I</a> went on the web page and I noticed it and I clicked on it and I just have to say I was so proud of these students when I saw the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=866.305s">Tears</a> came to my eyes and I was really, really felt very proud of our students winning this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=871.69s">So</a> thank you very, very much.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1222.776s">Mr.</a> Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1223.697s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1223.957s">Vertu.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1224.357s">I</a> would also like to thank the three teachers who went along for the presentation.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2057.617s">Mr.</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2060.147s">I</a> noticed that in the report that we got and it said under false state leadership skills USA we were seeking approval to attend this overnight leadership experience for six students and one advisor and that's on November 23rd through November 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2077.015s">So</a> in the report it says that they are seeking they want the school committee approval for attendance at the skills USA fall leadership conference which is coming up.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2090.894s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2091.494s">The,</a> um, we have to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2094.057s">Uh,</a> it's a weekend of November 23rd.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2097.079s">So</a> I think we need to take a, I don't think that's really, uh, I'm sure with the, uh, I'm sure with what the death of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2105.407s">Riccio's,</a> uh, mother, this may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2109.851s">So</a> maybe just to be on the safe side, if we, we, I don't think there's any controversy in it at all.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2120.348s">So</a> if you look in our folder, on the left-hand side, it said Medford Vocational Technical High School, the school committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2129.231s">And</a> I'm referring to the first paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2131.612s">Yeah,</a> Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2135.233s">So</a> in the first paragraph, it says we are seeking approval to attend this overnight leadership experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2143.035s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3077.921s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3078.442s">Seconded.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4057.356s">So</a> this is a real tough one because, to me, it suggests clearly a weakness. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4069.078s">And</a> I'm grateful that in this particular case, the weakness only resulted in a theft of some money and nothing more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4076.141s">I</a> am very concerned from the report that I received to understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I have to lay it at your feet, Mr. Superintendent, that you were informed of this on Friday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4089.867s">You</a> directed Principal Garino to file a report with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4094.073s">And</a> it wasn't until Monday that someone looked at the videotape. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4101.477s">Now,</a> I understand it was Friday night, but I can't believe that someone didn't go in and arrange the proper people to look at the videotape so that on Monday morning, all of our principals would have been assessed of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4118.806s">All</a> of us, everybody would have been alerted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4120.987s">I</a> understand that there was a concern of keeping <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4123.868s">the</a> identity and the incident under wraps so that police could start. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4129.953s">But</a> wouldn't the police have wanted to see the video on Friday night as opposed to Monday morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4135.577s">Could</a> you please address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4136.498s">Because</a> I can't fathom it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4173.272s">Well,</a> I can't, I mean, I for one say, you know, take the criticism, you drop the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4178.734s">And</a> I truly believe that there was not a sense of urgency, it seems to me, on this incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4187.19s">Again,</a> I'm grateful that the incident stopped where it stopped, and it wasn't something more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4192.071s">I</a> understand that we've had protocols in place, and I do understand the human error part of it with the people who allowed the individual to go about the building without being escorted down to the office, which is what our policy calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4207.436s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that once there was a known incident, it needed and deserved immediate attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4214.811s">need</a> to be sent, wait until Monday morning to figure out that it was, in fact, someone from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4220.916s">And</a> I am deeply disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4223.117s">I</a> was reading this and sighing and groaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4227.02s">And</a> my husband said, you know, that's what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4230.042s">The</a> problem is it always hurts the most when it's people you really respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4233.985s">And</a> I really respect you, but I really think you blew it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M/2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M.html">Medford City Council - October 20, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=632.603s">So</a> I'm wondering, this has not yet been announced to the students, correct?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=638.628s">So</a> I'm wondering, and maybe there's a few dollars that could go towards this, whether we could do something fun to celebrate it at the high school with all the teachers and administrators and the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=649.157s">I</a> don't have anything off the top of my head, but it seems like this would be worthy to <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=656.845s">I</a> would request that the superintendent be find some perhaps there's a few extra dollars here or there that might go for having some sort of recognition at the high school that everybody can share in.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1859.42s">So</a> was it sent out to the entire student body?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1896.26s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1897.421s">Thank</a> you for explaining that a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1899.102s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1900.423s">So</a> 60 is the maximum number of students you expect to be able to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1903.805s">For</a> this year, yes.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1905.366s">And</a> these courses, and I'm speaking specifically about one-grade graders, they will be taught by our current staff.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1968.717s">Now,</a> it seems when I've been up at the vocational school in the evening, I see many cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1974.282s">And</a> so, I'm somewhat surprised that Gould has pulled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1978.383s">Was</a> that because of a lack of students or, well, can you give us any better understanding of that?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2003.052s">And</a> it's at a greater distance so that us offering it here will have enough potential.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2691.058s">So</a> first, Mr. Cormier, I have to say it's delightful to see you here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2694.199s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2694.659s">And</a> we're very happy that you're back. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2698.101s">In</a> fact, now, if you take a day off, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2700.85s">or</a> two, there's no safe place, there's no hiding. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2704.433s">And</a> this gives us sort of a new perspective to, you know, they say, so teachers somehow know it's like they have eyes behind their head. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2710.819s">And</a> now you've got them all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2712.86s">So</a> a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2714.582s">Hunter,</a> thank you for taking the initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2717.384s">And</a> because I actually think, you know, I mean, if you think about it, we've talked about, you know, students being home and I've read some articles, but this is now <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2725.872s">when</a> a teacher has to be out, what a great potential here. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2728.716s">So</a> thank you so much and it's great to see you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3361.628s">So,</a> Pat, what I'm understanding is that this is basically the federal government is moving this and saying we need to change our price. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3372.477s">I</a> have to tell you, when I got to this paper, I was shocked at $1 to $1.50. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3379.542s">And</a> so they don't, they don't, you know, they don't, you know, they don't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3393.977s">They</a> don't qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3395.899s">And</a> that just seemed like a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3399.962s">So</a> I was surprised at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3401.683s">When</a> I got to the second part, I thought, 310, what an odd number. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3406.387s">Couldn't</a> we just do $3? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3408.248s">Do</a> we really need to do that dime? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3412.672s">I</a> have to tell you, it is a long time, because I was thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3415.974s">It</a> has been a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3417.776s">But</a> it sure did. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3421.118s">I</a> laughed at where it was, because we had all this good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3424.499s">And</a> sometimes, you know, the superintendent mentioned something to us that's coming up or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3429.18s">He</a> didn't mention this thing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3431.08s">And</a> so all of a sudden, we got to this paper, and she was like, whoa, shocker here, trying to slide it in, thinking we wouldn't notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3438.262s">Well,</a> we noticed.

 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5245.937s">The</a> second just comment I wanted to make, and this is totally about my places right now, okay, but down in your goals, one of your goals is increase MCAS performance by three percentage points. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5257.725s">I</a> would be much more comfortable if you identified <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5262.288s">increase</a> the geometry strand or pick out two or three different strands and say further students' knowledge of these particular stands rather than saying increase it overall by three points. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5274.034s">And</a> it is about my feeling about the testing and if we change, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5278.216s">I</a> just don't want people looking at our paperwork and saying, well, you know, we're driven by the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5284.459s">I</a> want to be driven by the subject.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5315.422s">So</a> I understand that this is a shorthand.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5318.004s">But</a> unfortunately, it's an uncomfortable shorthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5320.866s">That's</a> the overall piece of it, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5322.967s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5323.708s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7379.488s">This</a> is very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7380.809s">Rachel,</a> thanks for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7381.97s">There</a> were so many interesting things that you touched upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7384.972s">One</a> of them, though, I just want to ask you, you mentioned making a 10-minute video that the kids could watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7389.935s">Is</a> it posted someplace? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7392.237s">It</a> is not, but I can get you a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7394.018s">I</a> just was thinking that it could also be a nice introduction for other teachers at the elementary level and whatever, because I'm thinking so much that we're going to need to incorporate this somehow into our curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7408.287s">ways</a> to help kids relax and teachers relax, but I'm thinking about the anxiety that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7415.592s">So,</a> yeah, if it's possible, I'd love to see it.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8317.22s">Following</a> up on that is I thought that we should at least invite her to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8321.186s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8519.916s">I</a> just want to comment, I mean, I sort of got lost in some of the handouts you gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8523.897s">They're</a> great, very much like the PowerPoint that you'd mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8528.099s">And</a> reading the kids bring up very cute.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8532.541s">Yeah,</a> I definitely, it would be very, very nice to be able to provide that because clearly that's something that they enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8538.703s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8938.256s">Thank</a> you Bernadette. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8939.077s">How</a> many students can be included in the middle school computer science camp?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8970.881s">I</a> just note, because it's free, that parents looking... Right, it's free.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8998.351s">But</a> they do that for one week and then go to the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9001.833s">I'm</a> just saying that because it's free, it definitely stands out. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9007.756s">Anyway,</a> thank you for providing us with all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9011.317s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9012.358s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9098.163s">I</a> guess my concern was also just the change because I really kind of like the idea of being on the Tufts pool outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9105.965s">I</a> guess there's always pros and cons to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9110.005s">And</a> also, you know, at the elementary school there was a playground and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9114.406s">So</a> it changes the nature, again, whether it's a positive or negative, I'm not quite sure.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9209.293s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9211.335s">Yeah,</a> no, I just, I appreciate the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9213.737s">That's</a> exactly what I wanted to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9215.639s">Yeah,</a> and.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9985.808s">That's</a> what the invitation says. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9987.169s">May</a> 7th, do you have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9988.771s">No,</a> May 8th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9993.515s">That's</a> what was in our packet the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9996.778s">So</a> it was changed.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9999.661s">Well,</a> no, no, Roy, that's what was in our packet when you gave it to us at our last school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10005.987s">We</a> each had a letter, and it said Thursday, May 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10010.378s">And</a> the 11th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10014.942s">May</a> 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10016.063s">May</a> 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10016.484s">Thursday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10017.324s">Thursday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10017.725s">7th.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10017.845s">7th.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10028.678s">So</a> Roy, in terms of dates, you had the school council reports on the 11th.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10034.86s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10045.783s">We</a> have a meeting.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10049.323s">But</a> you changed it from the 11th, which was fine.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10295.636s">So,</a> Mr. Belson, can I just clarify that there's no possibility to hold any meeting on Monday? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10304.838s">It</a> was that because you thought it was the National Honor Society?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10313.304s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10313.524s">I'm</a> just wondering if we could have this subcommittee at PR on Monday.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10318.967s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10322.209s">On</a> the 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10323.13s">The</a> only reason I asked-
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10327.71s">The</a> only reason I'm asking is we had that date set aside and now, and I asked for that meeting months ago and now it would be thrown into a week where we already would have multiple meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10342.02s">It</a> would make more sense if there is no other conflict to do it on Monday.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_C0nvMKTnl38/2025-03-21_C0nvMKTnl38.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=85.066s">Robert</a> Emmett Skerry, Jr.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=627.352s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=629.272s">I'd</a> like to ask that a letter be sent out to Martinez Von Schor. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=634.234s">Dr.</a> Von Schor has been incredibly generous year after year supporting this, so please express our thanks from the Medford School Committee to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=643.197s">And</a> I'm thankful for the students who made a point of coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=646.798s">Thank</a> you very much, and we hope to see you again.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1310.068s">I</a> just was, Mr. Superintendent, when we looked at the kindergarten list, the one that does jump out is that one is a full-time and one is a part-time, and they've got the same number of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1322.096s">So</a> maybe we could have a further explanation at the next time.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2192.621s">So</a> I wanted to mention that I've received quite a number of inquiries about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2197.202s">People</a> being disappointed that in fact that the school committee made the decision to have Park administered this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2204.444s">And</a> I think I just wanted to be clear because when I wrote back to the people and explain that, you know, to me this is a shell game. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2213.953s">Mitchell</a> Chester at the DOE was getting a lot of flack about PARC, and so very simply he said, oh, we won't do PARC, we'll do MCAS 2.0, but the questions are going to be very PARC-like. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2228.741s">I</a> feel as a school committee member, I made that vote because we would be doing our students a disfavor not to <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2237.148s">at</a> least acclimate them to the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2240.952s">It's</a> one of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2242.253s">It's</a> parked by any other name. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2243.895s">This</a> name is now MCAS 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2246.297s">So</a> when I had the discussion one-on-one with people, I think that they understood where we were coming from, but it's frustrating to some level. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2257.023s">I</a> assume as usual that this letter will be sent out and it will be translated as necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2264.768s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2265.389s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2265.769s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2266.75s">Thanks</a> very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2267.49s">I'll</a> take a motion to put this on file.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2815.639s">Mrs.</a> Burke, I just wanted to mention before when the superintendent was saying he was going to be out, a couple of years ago, the school committee met at different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2826.428s">And</a> I think that there's a lot of value to doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2830.572s">And</a> we might do it, you know, maybe over the course of this year, but do it as a plan, not every meeting, because the disadvantage is that then our <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2842.448s">it's</a> more difficult to televise the meetings and have them on live and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2847.39s">So,</a> but if we could talk about that and think about that in the coming year of how we might get around to the different schools as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3656.395s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3657.475s">I</a> have three questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3659.437s">The</a> first thing you mentioned was the testing, the SCI training. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3663.299s">And</a> I wanted to ask about if you said we still had 100 teachers who needed that training. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3669.903s">What</a> happens if they don't get that training, and by when do they have to have it?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3689.313s">And</a> are we looking for, do we think we're going to get to 100% of our teachers?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3732.608s">So</a> I guess I would just encourage all of our teachers, because I would see value for our other teachers to have this training as well.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3749.319s">OK,</a> so that's how we covered the other.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3751.461s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3752.342s">Second</a> question is, there were a lot of newcomers at the Roberts, all together listed now at 58. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3760.997s">So</a> are some of those students then shifted over to the Brooks and Columbus? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3765.961s">Are</a> they moved? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3767.422s">No,</a> because they don't have newcomers programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3769.584s">No,</a> I'm saying after they... Oh, definitely, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3773.486s">When</a> they are ready to be transitioned, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3775.968s">So</a> wouldn't it be... So what we're doing is we're asking a student who is new to Medford and non-English speaking to perhaps be in grade one and two at the Roberts <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3787.965s">and</a> then go over to the Columbus or Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3790.506s">To</a> me, you're taking them out of a comfort area with people who know them, with their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3798.128s">And</a> to this population, who might be more vulnerable than many of our other, you're asking to do them an adjustment that other parents certainly wouldn't want their children to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3807.691s">Since</a> we have so many newcomers, why are we exploring the idea that perhaps we ought to have a newcomers <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3814.513s">program</a> at another school so that we're not pulling them out?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3893.896s">I</a> remember the conversation from before, but now as the numbers increase, part of me just says that it's never been particularly comfortable that you're going to ask those kids to uproot, which is what you're doing.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3908.499s">As</a> the program goes, I think it just needs to be always an ongoing question of, are we doing the best thing for these students? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3916.741s">My</a> third question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3919.61s">Does</a> the staff feel that the access test is accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3923.191s">Do</a> teachers agree with the placements, like when they come back and they get the results? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3926.712s">Because</a> we talk about testing, and we've got concerns about other tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3931.373s">Here's</a> a really interesting sort of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3934.474s">Are</a> your teachers, do they think the test accurately reflects where the student is?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3988.026s">But</a> it works that way rather than the other way where students are promoted too soon.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3995.147s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3995.227s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3995.587s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3996.568s">Thank</a> you very much, Lisa.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5000.169s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5000.329s">Vander</a> Kloof.
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5002.15s">Kathy,</a> is the security guard trained at the high school trained in this as well?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5020.375s">Yeah,</a> I just wondered what other groups of staff in particular came to mind?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5080.108s">How</a> about vice principals at the elementary schools?
 <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5770.289s">So</a> we better send her home.
