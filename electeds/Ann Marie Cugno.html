 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3872.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3873.283s">So</a> I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3877.525s">I'm</a> a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3886.608s">I'm</a> going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3894.731s">But</a> let's call this what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3896.812s">I</a> am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3901.475s">And</a> that is, this is not a gender issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3905.858s">This</a> is a power issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3908.039s">And</a> the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3921.721s">You</a> know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3943.075s">No,</a> I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3948.584s">$25</a> million could be used and utilized in so many more things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3953.226s">than</a> just the school committee increase or a school committee increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3959.35s">And</a> again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3975.596s">the</a> chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3986.109s">They're</a> also the same people that said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3990.325s">They</a> are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3997.832s">We</a> had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4004.859s">This</a> is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4007.071s">Board</a> committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4038.092s">opportunity</a> to speak what they want.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4061.694s">Okay,</a> I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4071.402s">I</a> would definitely want to be there but <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4074.344s">I</a> have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4077.746s">So</a> with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4084.27s">And</a> if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4088.913s">Give</a> them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4095.037s">If</a> we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.<h2><a href="../2021-06-15_5r8Hhmlpsmo/2021-06-15_5r8Hhmlpsmo.html">Regular School Committee Meeting June 14, 2021</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1974.3s">Oh</a> yeah, yes.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.392s">I</a> should know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.792s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5569.433s">So,</a> my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5574.655s">I've</a> been listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5575.316s">First</a> of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5588.348s">What</a> I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5603.383s">So</a> tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5611.289s">your</a> agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5624.542s">You're</a> here for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5627.708s">When</a> I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5634.85s">It</a> wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5647.393s">I</a> think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5659.06s">Let's</a> try the healing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5661.822s">I</a> totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5664.584s">I</a> think that what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5666.605s">Sutton</a> represents is tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5669.727s">I</a> think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5677.15s">but</a> we need someone to also represent the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5681.491s">There's</a> a connection with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5683.372s">Sutherland.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5684.292s">She</a> walked those halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5686.552s">The</a> children know that she walked those halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5689.673s">She</a> was the smiling face that they saw every morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5693.734s">There</a> are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5702.196s">So</a> I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5711.18s">The</a> people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5716.042s">We're</a> really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5723.305s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E/2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8345.745s">Okay,</a> yep, I'm all set, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8349.808s">I</a> actually have a couple of questions here, and that is, there's been discussion on two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8356.034s">One</a> is family engagement, and that is how to get your address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8362.497s">Oh,</a> I'm so sorry, Emery Cugno 871 Fellsway Medford mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.4s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.981s">Um,</a> you're welcome and I should have known better. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8369.023s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8370.444s">Um,</a> there were two things that people are talking about and that is one is family engagement and the other one is child engagement, family engagement is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8379.992s">I'm</a> not saying one is more important than the other, but I totally understand the engagement that a person has. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8385.414s">You're</a> only dealing with one teacher most of the time when you're K through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8390.876s">Once</a> they go to middle school, then there's teams of teachers and high school is the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8395.397s">It's</a> a very important issue that I know that there was communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8400.419s">I</a> know we had certain apps that we were working with, software programs that we were working with in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8405.861s">I'm</a> not sure if they're still up and going, but <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8410.404s">There's,</a> as a person listening to this meeting, as a parent, I would get, it seems a little bit nerve wracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8419.732s">First</a> of all, I do know that if anyone has ever, I mean, I was on the school committee for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8425.237s">I</a> don't remember anybody telling me they couldn't get in touch with their child for an emergency or because their buses had to get switched that day or because someone else was picking them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8436.206s">They</a> always called <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8437.947s">the</a> school and the school, whether it be the principal, headmaster, assistant principals, the information always got to the child. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8448.074s">So</a> I don't want parents out there thinking that if they don't have iPhones, if they don't have certain, you know, things to connect directly with the child, that they're never going to be able to get a message to their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8463.023s">The</a> other thing is, is that before we open up any more, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8468.746s">Mr.</a> Russo said something about pornography. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8472.227s">And</a> as a school committee member, I think that would be a huge issue that should be discussed and taken care of before emails and more emails are put on our sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8486.11s">So,</a> I mean, if people are saying that their children are seeing pornography that's coming to us, or, I mean, please specify and clarify what's going on, because I think it's important that before anybody else adds more onto our service, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8500.498s">um,</a> that that really needs to be addressed.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6242.202s">Emery</a> cuneo at 71 Fellsway Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6245.643s">Um,</a> I wasn't able to come down tonight and I had no intention actually of speaking, however, watching this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6254.911s">I</a> have to say how disheartening I am, not with not with the with the city council but in general, what's going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6264.438s">As</a> a former school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6266.379s">When</a> I started years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6267.74s">The</a> first thing I really challenged myself and making sure that we'd work on is bullying and the bullying one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6276.867s">the</a> internet, and we had many forums with many people, whether it be students or adults, police chief, police, we had experts from Bridgewater, and really felt better about those, those, not those rallies, those conferences with everybody and those meetings with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6300.678s">But</a> I have to say, I feel like we've gone backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6303.639s">It's</a> not the children that we have to worry about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6305.94s">It</a> is the adults that we have to worry about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6309.242s">And</a> unfortunately, we're the models for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6314.164s">So</a> what we do, what we say, how we say it, how we act, how we attack people on Facebook or any type of social media, it's something that our kids see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6328.827s">Now,</a> I don't plan on speaking on a lot of the things that everybody else has touched upon, but I will speak on a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6336.251s">And</a> that is one, Gene Barry, Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6341.494s">Whether</a> or not you know this person, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6345.493s">which</a> I did and I respected and I still respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6349.294s">And</a> now knowing her rest of the family still have the respect for, but that doesn't make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6356.395s">The</a> difference is, is that you have a person who has family in the city, who has given a lot to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6364.217s">No</a> one has the right to speak and throw things out about someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6370.963s">What</a> kills me is the fact that people that are writing are the ones that are saying we shouldn't act like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6379.051s">Now,</a> with that being said, as an Italian, so far now, I've been called a cheater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6388.66s">I've</a> been called other names. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6391.383s">Growing</a> up in this city changed a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6396.371s">because</a> we became evolved and like we expected to respect everyone, we don't pick and choose which nationality we are going to respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6409.679s">We</a> respect all nationalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6412.981s">From</a> an Italian who was bullied when she was in school, where my name was changed because I was an Italian, and over the years finally get respect that we are all being treated equally, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6426.368s">That</a> was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6429.111s">And</a> now to hear that if I'm Italian, I need to be quiet or I am now accused as a cheater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6435.476s">I</a> would love to know that if I wrote something like that about someone else from a different type of culture or a different nationality or a different group, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6447.41s">If</a> it would've been just thrown under the rug, shoved under the rug, and hey, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6454.472s">If</a> we are going to advocate for diversity, and if we are going to advocate for fairness in this city, it has to start with all nationalities, all cultures. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6471.737s">And</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6473.676s">Heard</a> something a few weeks ago, and I know but I think that I'm crazy but The thing that I heard was actually on It was on the Oscars and it was from Mr. Perry who received a humanitarian award and what I loved about what he said, and I truly believe this is that he said <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6499.074s">We,</a> in our hearts, do not have room for hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6505.757s">We</a> do not have room for hate for Asians, or blacks, or whites, or police officers, or anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6515.983s">We</a> need to come to a middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6518.784s">Well,</a> I believe there's someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6520.505s">I</a> don't know why I have someone else on my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6525.954s">What</a> we need to do is we need to get the city down. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6529.218s">Not</a> in the things of what we believe or who believes, but back in the middle to understand what the city's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6539.33s">And</a> I'm sorry, but I can't see the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6541.152s">I</a> actually see someone else on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6545.848s">But</a> what I'm trying to say is we need to come to the middle, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6551.191s">We're</a> not saying because you're here so many years that you have a right to speak above someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6557.696s">What</a> we're saying is let's talk together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6561.878s">And</a> it seems to me that the groups that are coming in contradict each other because they're treating each other like the ones that they're accusing other groups of being. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6572.721s">It's</a> frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6574.021s">And</a> now the latest I heard is for certain people that want to make sure that we, as when we present ourselves at a podium, are not supposed to say that we're lifelong citizens or residents of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6587.745s">I</a> don't know about anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6589.906s">But</a> I'm proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6591.507s">I</a> have grown up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6592.607s">I</a> have chose to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6595.089s">I</a> have chosen to keep my children and raise my children here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6599.271s">It</a> is not a disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6600.391s">It</a> is not a leprosy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6602.592s">It</a> is a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6603.573s">And</a> I want to be proud of I am an Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6607.455s">And</a> yes, I am proud to say that I come from Fredford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6611.077s">But</a> I am not proud of where method is going.<h2><a href="../2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w/2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w.html">Committee of the Whole - Columbus School Naming Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">Could</a> you hear me now?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">Man,</a> you can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">Okay,</a> so I do understand where everyone is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">I</a> know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">One</a> was from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">Mostone</a> and the other one is from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">But</a> again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">And</a> my standpoint is that with <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">the</a> commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">You</a> need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">Yes,</a> they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">two,</a> three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">I</a> do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">I</a> know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">I</a> believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">So</a> again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">precedence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">We</a> need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">Could</a> someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">From</a> the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">Okay,</a> because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">And</a> that's coming, that should have already been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">And</a> the discussion is already should have already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">I'm</a> not aware if it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">But</a> I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">And</a> at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">A</a> lot of people go on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">So</a> it's all right.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3822.543s">hold</a> on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3847.561s">And</a> as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3867.934s">And</a> from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3876.7s">And</a> it wasn't open to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3879.183s">I</a> just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3880.825s">The</a> other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3886.67s">So</a> if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3891.255s">And</a> how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3903.259s">Okay,</a> because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3921.761s">The</a> other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3933.7s">The</a> fact remains is who's going to be interviewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3938.31s">the</a> people that apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3940.052s">Who</a> is selecting the applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3943.255s">Has</a> the diversity director seen the application before it goes out? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3946.657s">Has</a> the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3952.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3953.703s">And</a> I have had a lot of questions of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3957.126s">not</a> to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3966.634s">Because</a> I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3972.058s">Because</a> that is, it's okay.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6925.842s">I'm</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6926.242s">I'm</a> just getting it ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6932.286s">I</a> guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6936.108s">I</a> asked a few questions before, and that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6940.211s">The</a> reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6950.895s">So</a> I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6955.456s">But</a> as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6961.358s">Has</a> the diversity director seen it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6965.08s">You</a> know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6970.402s">Again,</a> we're talking the priority of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6975.483s">If</a> there are people right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6977.916s">on</a> the committee that feel that the name should be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6981.119s">I</a> don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6996.393s">The</a> change is going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6997.975s">So</a> I don't understand why that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7000.497s">Second</a> of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7002.176s">Again,</a> I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7008.603s">You</a> have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7019.054s">Being</a> involved in the system, I know how much time it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7024.244s">But</a> again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7029.645s">How</a> much time is gonna be put into it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7031.806s">Who</a> are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7036.047s">How</a> are you going to put everyone on the same schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7042.048s">More</a> importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7052.907s">I</a> don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7060.23s">I'm</a> sorry, Lisa.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9427.874s">OK,</a> so if I'm understanding this the correct way, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9433.08s">If</a> I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to take a round of questions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9436.563s">You're</a> going to go and work on the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9439.605s">And</a> then once it's done and you're all finished, you're going to come back to take more questions from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9448.132s">So</a> we're after 8 o'clock now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9450.715s">So</a> we're going to expect you to come back at 10, 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9454.938s">That's</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9456.339s">Second</a> of all is the fact that, you know, everybody keeps on saying everybody's been hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9461.244s">I</a> think everybody forgets the fact that if everybody had been heard in June, you would have had your 600 signatures against the, I don't want to say against, but <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9474.375s">versus</a> the 300 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9476.596s">So</a> I guess my question again, isn't this a mute conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9482.199s">Because</a> everybody keeps on saying that everybody's been hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9486.0s">And</a> these questions and concerns from the community started when we finally did hear about what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9494.521s">And</a> again, it's just frustrating because I've asked questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9498.745s">There</a> have been other people tonight that have asked questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9501.467s">And</a> out of respect, it would be nice if we got some type of answer because you still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9508.133s">You</a> don't know any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9511.476s">And</a> as far as the comment on process and policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9515.914s">As</a> a former school committee member, we had many processes and policies, we just didn't throw this up and say in one night, we're going to do this, whether people you know agree or disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9527.828s">I</a> just think that the process, again, you're going to have people against him for this, but this is a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9535.325s">community</a> has been speaking, and it seems like tonight that people are asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9540.79s">There</a> still has not been one person who has stood up and answered any of them or addressed any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9547.896s">But</a> on June 30th, or whatever the day was, those answers to those questions were all answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9556.803s">As</a> a school committee, you're supposed to be representing the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9561.527s">Thank</a> you, Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9563.189s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16325.005s">I'm</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16327.106s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16328.587s">Basically,</a> again, we're still at the same position we were four hours ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16333.269s">I</a> mean, you have a committee who keeps on telling me that it's not gonna take any time, it doesn't take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16338.451s">We</a> have administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16340.012s">We</a> have to open up our schools to all our elementary schools have to be open in three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16346.475s">I</a> don't understand this process this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16349.756s">And</a> honestly, the members keep on saying that they hear people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16353.298s">Well,</a> I've been listening to people all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16355.939s">but</a> no one has addressed the situation yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16358.741s">It's</a> like you've heard, but you're continuing on with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16362.864s">You're</a> continuing on with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16364.346s">I</a> mean, you have members that are concerned that there might be actors that might be applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16370.45s">How</a> are they going to distinguish which ones are actors and which ones are not actors? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16375.974s">I</a> mean, I am frustrated to the point that I am so disheartened with my school committee, something I cherished very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16385.882s">and</a> to keep on listening to this for the next four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16390.086s">And</a> no one has discussed anything about our school, our kids going back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16394.39s">And</a> as far as member McLaughlin, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16397.173s">It</a> is not up to the school committee to make the policy of how they're going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16401.357s">But</a> you have to be involved in that planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16404.74s">You</a> need to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16408.021s">I</a> mean, this is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16410.363s">No</a> one is saying to change your values change your opinion, change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16415.268s">We're</a> just asking, or I'm asking, slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16419.963s">pick</a> it and do it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16422.004s">As</a> far as people saying they've heard us, I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16425.427s">Because</a> if you listen to what's going on tonight, for the last four hours of participation, you've had both people that are for it and people that are against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16433.893s">But</a> it seems that the people are for it have been listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16437.856s">And</a> the people that are not for it, for whatever reason, everybody has the right to believe what they wanna believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16444.82s">Put</a> the kids first tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16448.362s">and</a> postponing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16450.223s">I'd</a> like to know if the process is gonna be like this to make sure our kids are gonna have proms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16455.127s">What's</a> the MCAS gonna be like? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16457.068s">Is</a> there gonna be an MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16458.869s">Is</a> there gonna be any type of social break for the kids this year?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23094.181s">Can</a> I just ask the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23095.422s">Because</a> I wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23096.202s">Are</a> you still going to be taking names of Italian people or people in history with Italian names? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23104.806s">Or</a> is that off the table?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23108.227s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23111.676s">All</a> right, and then what I do ask is that, you know, for some people it's the name, for some people it's what it represents and doesn't represent, and some people believe certain readings that they have read, some have other opinions, but really keep in mind, you know, it's about culture, it's about history, it's about, yes, it's about Italians that did come into the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23140.981s">and</a> didn't make, made a lot of sacrifices. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23143.783s">And</a> I am an Italian, I understand exactly what the, just, you know, diversity is and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23152.609s">But</a> if it's not about the Italian name, and that's what I've been hearing tonight, then I really recommend that an Italian name be selected, because it feels as an Italian American, and I truly, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23166.338s">believe</a> this is that it's wiping out a lot of what you know the community stood for, and I understand about the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23175.469s">I</a> know about the diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23176.991s">I</a> know about progress, but <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23179.87s">If</a> it seems like we've been asking all night to postpone or whatever, and even though people have listened, they haven't heard, and people are gonna get upset that I said that, but at least listen to the fact that we do have more than just a name attached to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23198.82s">There's</a> a lot more that, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, but there's a lot more that maybe people are not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23206.164s">that</a> maybe if they ask the people that live in the city and has doesn't have to be, you don't have to be here your whole life, you don't have to be here 10 months, you don't have to be here a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23215.65s">I'm</a> just saying listen, and really understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23220.092s">It's</a> not just about a name.<h2><a href="../2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc/2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14813.061s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14815.342s">First</a> of all, I've been listening to the meeting tonight, and I know you said give me two minutes, but I'm gonna try my best. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14822.465s">I've</a> been listening to the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14825.727s">As</a> some of you might know or not know, I am a former school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14830.949s">And</a> I try to listen with fair ears and to listen to all sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14837.533s">It</a> seems like listening to all the subcommittee meetings that you've had, and with the mandate of, let's say, the commissioner, there's a lot on everyone's plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14852.502s">And</a> there has to be a president's, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't get this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14860.856s">We're</a> talking about process, we're talking about priorities and looking at what you have on your plate, you have budgets coming, you have the, you know, you have parents that really don't know if they want to select hybrid if they do want to select hybrid if they want to have their students in school, there's a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14880.831s">With</a> all due respect, you guys have spent a lot of time on this, but I can guarantee you there's going to be a lot more phone calls from a lot of people right now, asking about the differences between, you know, what they choose what they don't choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14895.695s">I</a> guess, from what I've been hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14899.176s">It's</a> not the fact of, do you want to name change of the Columbus? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14903.42s">Don't</a> you want the name change of the Columbus? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14905.542s">I</a> guess what I'm respectfully asking is asking the school committee and you, the mayor, as the chair, to really consider putting the priority of putting our children back into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14916.732s">I</a> know you've been working diligently on trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14920.255s">But</a> when you have the commissioner of the state of Massachusetts, who is going to start <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14925.506s">putting</a> mandates and putting his own spin on certain things, even though it might not seem fair, it's going to have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14934.773s">And</a> listening to the results of the decrease of the positive COVID tests, I mean, listening to a lot of the people that have already called and made decisions to the school system, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14950.505s">to</a> let them know if their children are going hybrid and stuff, you do have a lot of positives going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14957.157s">So</a> when the commissioner looks at something like that, he's going to know that here's a city <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14963.905s">who</a> is going to be positive, and he's going to be putting more pressure on that because the numbers that decrease in COVID are huge as far as the lesser we have, the better opportunity to get back into the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14978.975s">They</a> are going to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14980.817s">And</a> so I know there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14984.099s">you</a> know, high passionate people out there for or against this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14990.001s">But</a> honestly, at this point, I really just ask the school committee to please put your priorities intact as far as this just came up the pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15000.906s">You</a> need to look at that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16077.722s">Yeah,</a> I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16078.983s">So</a> basically, listening to everyone, again, I mean, what everybody's put on the table is extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16085.489s">I</a> totally agree about the non-rushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16087.831s">I</a> know that even with that being said, there might be members that don't believe that it's a rushed decision, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16098.741s">member</a> credits for bringing up the no name situation, because I know that that's been out there and people were concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16107.147s">But</a> again, you know it's time is of the essence, and you have so much going on that now you're here this evening, you've already spoken about it, I understand how the rules go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16120.353s">But</a> now you're going to spend Wednesday night discussing this all over again and going into it in more depth and detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16129.641s">I</a> guess stepping back and looking at what's going on and what's being asked of from cities and towns all over the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16139.17s">It</a> just seems that that time that you're spending on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16143.776s">No</a> one is saying that, at least, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16148.643s">I'm</a> just saying the priority of the dates and the time that you have and what you need to spend it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16155.231s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16156.771s">I</a> truly believe that the time should be spent on getting the kids back in school, what the game plan is, how much money is it going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16164.353s">You</a> have custodians that are going to have to be cleaning a lot more than what they're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16168.734s">You</a> know, what do you have in the budget set aside? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16170.694s">I</a> mean, there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16173.235s">So</a> I respectfully just say, you know, it's really to look at your timeframe.<h2><a href="../2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8/2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 18, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=998.342s">When</a> we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1008.551s">And</a> so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1015.958s">If</a> we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1019.541s">if</a> you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1026.544s">And</a> that's something that you, as a committee, have to sit down and discuss on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1032.167s">So</a> that would be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1033.708s">And</a> the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1042.777s">we're</a> kind of like playing very fine line with that law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1047.419s">And</a> a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1063.067s">So</a> that was the reason we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1066.635s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1067.175s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1069.516s">So</a> Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1071.797s">Who</a> was seconded? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1073.298s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1074.238s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1076.519s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.439s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.68s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.86s">OK,</a> so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1084.422s">Community</a> participation, Maureen Roney. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1089.184s">Roney,</a> I apologize.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1639.876s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1675.755s">Okay,</a> and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scottie just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1682.324s">Okay,</a> I just wanted to make sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1686.19s">I</a> just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1690.233s">I</a> think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school, but with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1704.665s">I</a> don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1713.362s">to</a> utilize it the best we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1715.784s">So</a> with that being said, let's see, are we gonna roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1723.371s">It</a> was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1727.936s">So</a> all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1729.117s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1730.718s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1733.02s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, none in the negative.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1749.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1750.56s">OK,</a> seven in the affirmative and none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1753.562s">We</a> will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can and placed in file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1760.127s">So</a> recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1885.863s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1886.103s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1887.324s">If</a> you could just make sure that during the year you let us know how students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1954.286s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1956.488s">Seventh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.108s">Seventh</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.748s">Seventh</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1958.989s">He's</a> done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1960.05s">And</a> again, we appreciate all that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1963.013s">All</a> of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1964.454s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1994.193s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1996.215s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2005.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2006.683s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, nine in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2008.505s">We</a> will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Schmitt as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2011.807s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.708s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.168s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.569s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2014.77s">Report</a> on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2505.578s">Before</a> I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2514.482s">And</a> this is our second? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2516.305s">first</a> and then just because it's been such a great program and already there's been so much going on at the end of the three years have they already discussed like what the process is going to be if you're going to be able to reapply for it or is it so we are going to be able to reapply or is it like one of those you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time oh okay
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2547.702s">You're</a> looking for what?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2554.645s">And</a> I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2560.217s">I</a> know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2573.966s">And</a> some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2580.091s">with</a> our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2583.394s">So</a> you hear, you know, certain stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2585.135s">And</a> I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2594.804s">And</a> when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2600.589s">And</a> I know the type of kids that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2603.191s">So</a> if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2612.9s">If</a> we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2621.068s">I</a> think it would be amazing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2623.71s">just</a> as much as it's amazing for us and our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2626.191s">I</a> know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2635.334s">It</a> was amazing when I left there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2637.314s">Because</a> they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2643.636s">And</a> it's nice, they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2645.517s">They're</a> in our center of our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2647.177s">They're</a> in the center of the heart of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2649.138s">It</a> would be nice for them to know what type of students we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2653.92s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2655.101s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3415.256s">I</a> did hear about that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3416.396s">Actually,</a> I had a lady who approached me on that, and she was extremely thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3421.398s">I'm</a> not going to say we, you guys were doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3425.422s">And</a> they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3432.37s">I</a> guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3436.254s">So</a> I know that they get together on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3439.798s">at</a> lunchtime, especially around the holiday times, and around the year they have certain lunches that they do, and I know it's hard, because our kids are in school, but if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves, tell them what you're there for, and maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3458.945s">Something</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3460.165s">That</a> was what I was looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3461.526s">But</a> I did hear about that, and it's a fabulous program.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.1s">That's</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.7s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3469.34s">Are</a> we going to introduce the students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.917s">How</a> many did you steal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3747.645s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3748.525s">That's</a> fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3749.266s">That's</a> absolutely fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3750.566s">And</a> hearing stories, and everyone can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3753.467s">You</a> don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that, and you also represented the students in your school doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3761.229s">Talk</a> about a great way of opening up your heart and, you know, and opening up your mind that, for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3769.872s">It</a> could be us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3770.472s">So</a> if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3774.643s">And</a> lucky enough, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3784.848s">So</a> that's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3785.909s">So</a> anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3810.463s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3811.263s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.164s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.239s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.739s">When</a> you say that you actually, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to introduce them to other students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4045.38s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4046.71s">And</a> are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4186.653s">The</a> workshops that you had, were they videotaped?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4195.318s">But</a> are they playing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4196.839s">Are</a> they playing on our studio stations? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4200.404s">Because</a> that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4206.586s">You</a> know, the creative workshops, something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4213.028s">Even</a> what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4217.509s">But</a> even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4222.551s">you</a> know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4233.099s">You</a> know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4244.908s">We're</a> going to be there to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4246.189s">I</a> think it's very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4247.691s">So</a> if we could play that on our station, that would be great.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4326.193s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4328.095s">Just</a> for clarification, Mr. Spocker, you had said that <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4331.901s">You're</a> working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4335.103s">Roberts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4336.523s">McGlynn.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.023s">And</a> McGlynn.

No, there's no fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4700.165s">No</a> fee, just the approval only, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4701.946s">Okay,</a> so I just want to make sure that that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.027s">the</a> way that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.728s">But</a> in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4714.575s">With</a> this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4722.33s">What</a> happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4725.595s">Are</a> they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4728.839s">Or</a> are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and say, we really need to do certain things?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4757.379s">So</a> with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4760.442s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4761.423s">Second</a> by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4763.344s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4764.265s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4765.126s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4767.808s">Six</a> affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4770.791s">The</a> motion to place the report on file is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4774.814s">Report</a> on security cameras.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5828.068s">When</a> does this draft have to be accepted by?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5836.35s">And</a> so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5844.494s">But</a> the amount isn't?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.4s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.78s">So</a> by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.071s">And</a> seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.892s">Vanderbilt.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6567.513s">All</a> in favor?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6583.384s">OK,</a> so I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6595.234s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6596.255s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6597.236s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6599.175s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6600.296s">Motion</a> to place this on file for our following week.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6665.412s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6666.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6667.053s">Negotiations</a> and legal matters, there are none. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6672.345s">Okay,</a> and two items under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6674.709s">May</a> I have a motion to entertain this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6676.792s">Motion</a> for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6679.155s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6680.938s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6684.143s">Vanderpool.</a>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7597.908s">say</a> thank you to you, the staff, for doing it in such a professional manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7603.553s">And</a> you really did expedite it very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7605.795s">And</a> I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7613.081s">And</a> Justin, I stand here, and sometimes over the years, I kind of think that, you know, what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7622.028s">And</a> then I hear someone like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7624.51s">And</a> you just make it so refreshing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7626.252s">And</a> you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7629.874s">That</a> we have to be sensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7632.116s">We're</a> not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7637.68s">But</a> we have to get back to a society where we have to take <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7642.572s">our</a> responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7648.775s">And</a> we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7654.998s">So</a> it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free for all all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7662.262s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7882.66s">Dr.</a> Peralta, you said 630?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7895.31s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to ask real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7897.452s">What</a> are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7900.514s">Is</a> it based on cigarette smoking?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7920.137s">And</a> could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7977.756s">And</a> is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7985.562s">And</a> you're definitely right, you have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7992.148s">But</a> you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion, so it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8033.769s">When</a> you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8044.912s">Is</a> it, you know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8110.603s">And</a> it's not expensive.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8118.485s">The</a> gadget? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8119.825s">The</a> gadget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8120.285s">That</a> we were just passing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8516.759s">Justin,</a> I know you had your hand up.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8635.842s">I</a> think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece, but an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8650.127s">It's</a> unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8653.708s">This</a> is a country issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8655.648s">This</a> is a worldwide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8658.53s">But,</a> you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8665.276s">So</a> we want to make sure that our kids are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8667.037s">And</a> I think just opening up and talking more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8669.96s">And,</a> you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about, you know, like we do about the cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8675.885s">but</a> we don't want to get there either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8677.666s">And</a> the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8690.15s">I</a> don't know, I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, okay, could I fool them? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8698.574s">Could</a> I get away with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8699.954s">And</a> I think that has a huge component to it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8703.095s">But</a> the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8708.717s">Yeah,</a> they made it legal, but it doesn't, this is what really could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8712.758s">And</a> I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8862.659s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8863.8s">Do</a> I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.181s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.581s">Do</a> I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8873.282s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Burke.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.118s">You</a> were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.918s">You</a> were a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9266.919s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9268.099s">We</a> were all parents.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9881.628s">some</a> time to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9883.872s">I</a> just want to say thank you to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9885.435s">I</a> was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9891.831s">This</a> was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9901.86s">Everybody</a> comes from a different perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9905.483s">The</a> one thing that when I started, I started with, I was the new member, and within the next term, I became a senior member. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9916.946s">A</a> lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9921.248s">And</a> they were lucky enough to get on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9924.249s">One</a> thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9932.853s">And</a> keep what's important in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9937.094s">I</a> said I was going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9938.575s">So</a> with that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9941.427s">Always</a> make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9949.771s">It's</a> very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9961.502s">Don't</a> want to be disrespectful to any PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9964.224s">I've</a> been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9965.465s">I've</a> been on the site councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9967.166s">This</a> is not a glorified PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9969.587s">We</a> have to abide by rules, regulations, the state, and federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9974.69s">And</a> sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9978.913s">So</a> with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent, who always has his door open. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9990.014s">This</a> was my decision, I'm crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9991.756s">Thank</a> God I didn't get it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9993.758s">It</a> wasn't because I didn't want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9997.562s">He</a> opened up the door into the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present, Dr. Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10011.692s">really</a> all of the principals have always had an open door. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10017.956s">When</a> I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10023.739s">And</a> I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10026.9s">What</a> is she going to come up with today? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10028.581s">But</a> all in all, it was just a wonderful ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10032.683s">And</a> I couldn't have done it without the people back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10037.105s">Oh</a> my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10041.017s">When</a> I decided to run, it was a family decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10044.098s">My</a> family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight, probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10054.28s">And</a> Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10059.321s">But</a> other than that, to my husband, to my son Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who's always been there for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10066.123s">to</a> make me look good back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10068.345s">But</a> just work with your minds, but really work with your heart.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10102.633s">I</a> have plenty of life, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10105.3s">This</a> was a relaxing time.<h2><a href="../2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY/2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 18, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=882.22s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=987.355s">If</a> I may on that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=988.475s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=989.336s">When</a> we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=999.539s">And</a> so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1006.942s">If</a> we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1017.547s">And</a> that's something that you as a committee have to sit down and discuss on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1023.19s">So</a> that would be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1024.71s">And</a> the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very, we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1038.439s">And</a> a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1054.053s">So</a> that was the reason we can't do that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1058.155s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1060.497s">So</a> Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1062.798s">Who</a> was seconded? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1064.299s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1065.239s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1067.521s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.361s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.641s">OK,</a> so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1075.405s">Community</a> participation, Maureen Roney. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1080.168s">Roney,</a> I apologize.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1666.285s">Okay,</a> and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Skerry just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1673.291s">Okay,</a> I just want to make sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1677.179s">I</a> just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1681.221s">I</a> think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1686.404s">But</a> with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1695.669s">I</a> don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity to utilize it the best we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1706.815s">So</a> with that being said, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1711.497s">Are</a> we going to roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1714.378s">It</a> was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1718.94s">So</a> all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1720.121s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1721.722s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1724.021s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, none in the negative.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1741.566s">OK,</a> seven in the affirmative and none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1744.547s">We</a> will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1749.762s">and</a> placed in file. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1751.144s">So</a> recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1876.851s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1877.091s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1877.852s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1878.312s">If</a> you could just make sure that during the year you left students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1885.575s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1944.366s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1945.287s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.208s">Seventh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.888s">Seventh</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1948.669s">Seventh</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1949.989s">He's</a> done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1951.05s">And</a> again, we appreciate all that he's done, all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1955.425s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1970.992s">I</a> should have known better than to say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1974.874s">It's</a> the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1976.855s">They're</a> building this for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1978.776s">So</a> may I interrupt? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1982.497s">motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1983.098s">Second</a> by, uh, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1984.739s">Vander</a> Kloof, I believe it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1986.28s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1996.367s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1997.688s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, nine in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1999.509s">We</a> will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2002.611s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2004.432s">Okay,</a> report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2496.63s">Before</a> I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2505.498s">And</a> this is our second?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2507.6s">Oh,</a> OK, because we got it approved last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2510.002s">So</a> this is, OK, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2511.803s">And</a> then, just because it's been such a great program, and already there's been so much going on, at the end of the three years, have they already discussed, like, what the process is going to be, if you're going to be able to reapply for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2525.534s">So</a> we are going to be able to reapply, or is this, like, one of those, you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2545.686s">And</a> I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2551.237s">I</a> know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2565.009s">And</a> some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2571.094s">with</a> our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2574.436s">So</a> you hear, you know, certain stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2576.157s">And</a> I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2585.863s">And</a> when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2591.607s">And</a> I know the type of kids that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2594.208s">So</a> if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2603.911s">If</a> we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2612.073s">I</a> think it would be amazing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2614.734s">just</a> as much as it's amazing for us and our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2617.095s">I</a> know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2626.361s">It</a> was amazing when I left there, because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2634.666s">And</a> it's nice, they're here, they're in our center of our square, they're in the center of the heart of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2640.169s">It</a> would be nice for them to know what type of students we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2644.362s">So</a> Mr. Benedetto.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3406.189s">I</a> did hear about that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3407.45s">Actually,</a> I had a lady who approached me on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3409.591s">And</a> she was extremely thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3412.233s">that</a> we were, that you guys were doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3413.994s">I'm</a> not going to say we, you guys were doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3416.716s">And</a> they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3423.4s">I</a> guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3427.282s">So</a> I know that they get together on a Friday at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3433.044s">And</a> around the year, they have certain lunches that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3435.405s">And</a> I know why, because our kids are in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3437.466s">But</a> if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3443.668s">Tell</a> them what you're there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3445.128s">And</a> maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3449.99s">Something</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3451.21s">That</a> was what I was looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3452.591s">I</a> did hear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3453.871s">And</a> it's a fabulous program.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3457.874s">That's</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.755s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.916s">So</a> are we going to introduce the students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3731.565s">And</a> my, yes, and my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3738.488s">Very</a> certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3739.569s">That's</a> fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3740.309s">That's</a> absolutely fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3741.629s">And</a> hearing stories, and everyone can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3744.431s">You</a> don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3748.172s">And</a> you also represented the students in your school doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3752.274s">Talk</a> about a great way of opening up your heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3755.195s">And,</a> you know, and opening up your mind that for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3760.92s">It</a> could be us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3761.52s">So</a> if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3765.684s">And</a> lucky enough, you know, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3775.852s">So</a> that's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3776.973s">So</a> anybody else on our committee would like to say anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3779.575s">Kathy?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3860.511s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3983.739s">When</a> you say that you actually, do you, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to like introduce them to other students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4036.427s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4037.716s">And</a> are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4041.528s">And</a> up next is Kayla Malone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4043.855s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4177.69s">The</a> workshops that you had, were they videotaped?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4186.355s">But</a> are they playing? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4187.876s">Are</a> they playing on our studio station? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4191.46s">Because</a> that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing, the creative workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4200.223s">Something</a> like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4204.084s">Even</a> what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4208.565s">But</a> even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4213.587s">you</a> know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4224.157s">You</a> know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4235.947s">We're</a> going to be there to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4237.268s">I</a> think it's very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4239.543s">play</a> that on our station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4241.084s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.444s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.664s">Van</a> der Kloot?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.532s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.852s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4319.133s">Just</a> for clarification, Mr. Spock, you had said that you're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4327.55s">McGlynn?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4328.771s">OK,</a> so everybody's included.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4377.963s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4378.523s">And</a> thank you, Justin.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4438.698s">Okay,</a> I pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4440.659s">Do</a> we have a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4442.501s">I</a> think we're all set, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4443.321s">Can</a> I entertain a motion to accept this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4447.384s">By</a> Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4448.745s">Second</a> by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4450.166s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.087s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.647s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4453.903s">Okay,</a> seven in the affirmative, the report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4461.851s">And</a> I just want to throw something out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4464.574s">I</a> know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4470.759s">And</a> it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4476.602s">And</a> when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4487.488s">And</a> this, this particular program, is something that the superintendent definitely worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4492.993s">And</a> it was with his networking and finding the people that did it, and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford, and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4505.963s">So</a> I just wanted to recognize him for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4508.565s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4509.965s">And</a> now for the report statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4512.486s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4513.326s">Report</a> on statement of interest application to NSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4517.207s">Mr.</a> Superintendent.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.174s">And?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4672.508s">I</a> just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.552s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.732s">And</a> that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be starting... No, it's going to go back into the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4686.622s">A</a> new application. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4687.463s">So</a> a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4691.206s">No</a> fee, just the approval, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4692.588s">Okay,</a> so I just want to make sure that that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4695.09s">the</a> way that is, but in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4705.615s">With</a> this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4713.378s">What</a> happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4716.642s">Are</a> they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved, or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and saying, we really need to do certain things?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4748.434s">So</a> with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4751.077s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4752.478s">Second</a> by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4754.4s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4755.281s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4756.182s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4758.837s">Six</a> affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4761.819s">The</a> motion to place the report on file is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4765.841s">Report</a> on security cameras.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5136.689s">Okay,</a> so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5153.452s">Okay,</a> so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5163.04s">Made</a> by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.003s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.963s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5168.024s">Any</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5169.826s">Motion</a> passes, and we will have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5172.568s">Did</a> you receive and place this report on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5174.63s">Yes,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5178.723s">Recommendation</a> to approve school lunch charge, I mean, sorry, charge policy.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5191.502s">Just</a> for clarification, change policy or charge policy?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5827.29s">And</a> so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5834.594s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5835.415s">But</a> the amount is it?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.415s">May</a> I? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.675s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.536s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.596s">Van</a> der Klooten, and then we'll go.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.009s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.629s">I</a> guess what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6275.849s">Vanden</a> Heuvel said, if the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6286.431s">They're</a> going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6291.552s">Does</a> it really matter if it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6293.47s">a</a> cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what, and they'll be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6300.079s">So</a> I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and approve <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6311.979s">what</a> you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6315.382s">So</a> we have that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6316.984s">But</a> don't approve, make it separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6319.266s">And</a> don't approve the amount until maybe you could come back with something a little bit better.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6537.507s">I</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.508s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.728s">So</a> by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6574.599s">So</a> I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6586.182s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6587.202s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6588.203s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6590.15s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6591.23s">Motion</a> to place this on file for our following week.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6610.078s">And</a> thank you to Stop and Shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6611.878s">And</a> thank you to Stop and Shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6616.201s">to</a> send out a letter of recognition and thanking them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6619.565s">Justin,</a> I think we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6621.287s">Did</a> you still want to say something on this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6656.35s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.69s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.97s">Negotiations</a> and legal matters, there are none. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6663.3s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6664.381s">And</a> two items under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6665.661s">May</a> I have a motion to entertain? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6667.743s">Motion</a> for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6670.104s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6671.865s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.206s">Seconded</a> by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.947s">Vanderpool.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6729.609s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7501.75s">Justin?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7578.228s">Someone</a> said I was completely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7585.129s">First</a> and only. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7586.35s">I</a> just want to say thank you to you, staff, for doing it in such a professional manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7594.531s">And</a> you really did expedite it very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7596.752s">And</a> I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7604.033s">And</a> Justin, I stand here and sometimes over the years I kind of think that, you know, what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7613.255s">And</a> then I hear someone like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7615.516s">And</a> you just make it so refreshing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7617.236s">And</a> you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7620.857s">That</a> we have to be sensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7623.098s">We're</a> not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7628.639s">But</a> we have to get back to a society where we have to take <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7633.557s">our</a> responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7639.76s">And</a> we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7645.963s">So</a> it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free-for-all all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7653.226s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7873.564s">Dr.</a> Perola, you said 630?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7885.208s">I</a> just wanted to ask real quick, what are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7892.774s">Is</a> it based on cigarette smoking?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7911.108s">And</a> could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7967.839s">And</a> is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7976.532s">And</a> you're definitely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7978.333s">You</a> have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7983.136s">But</a> you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.939s">So</a> it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8024.758s">When</a> you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8037.124s">You</a> know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8191.398s">Kathy,</a> did you have your hand up?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8507.737s">Justin,</a> I know you had your hand up.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8626.83s">I</a> think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8631.653s">But</a> an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8641.1s">It's</a> unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8644.682s">This</a> is a country issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8646.623s">This</a> is a worldwide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8649.485s">But,</a> you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8656.25s">So</a> we want to make sure that our kids are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8657.991s">And</a> I think just opening up and talking more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8660.913s">And,</a> you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about this, you know, like we do about the cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8666.857s">But</a> we don't want to get there either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8668.638s">And</a> the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8677.064s">just</a> to like, if they can get away with it type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.107s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.607s">I</a> mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, OK, could I fool them? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8689.533s">Could</a> I get away with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8690.915s">And</a> I think that has a huge component to it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8694.077s">But</a> the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8699.701s">Yeah,</a> they made it legal, but it doesn't, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8702.003s">This</a> is what really could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8703.785s">And</a> I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8851.738s">Do</a> I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.164s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.564s">Do</a> I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8864.289s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Burke.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.107s">You</a> were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.888s">You</a> were a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9259.11s">We</a> were all parents.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9871.496s">I</a> just want to say thank you to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9876.559s">I</a> was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9882.83s">This</a> was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9892.854s">Everybody</a> comes from a different perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9896.475s">The</a> one thing that when I started, I started with, I was, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9901.557s">the</a> new member. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9903.317s">And</a> within the next term, I became a senior member. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9907.938s">A</a> lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9912.239s">And</a> they were lucky enough to get on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9915.24s">One</a> thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9923.843s">and</a> keep what's important in here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9928.064s">I</a> said I was going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9929.565s">So,</a> with that being said, always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9940.768s">It's</a> very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9951.213s">I</a> don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9955.215s">I've</a> been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9956.475s">I've</a> been on the side councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9958.176s">This</a> is not a glorified PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9960.577s">We</a> have to abide by rules, regulations, the state and federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9965.699s">And</a> sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9969.901s">So</a> with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent who always has his door open. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9981.007s">This</a> was my decision, I'm crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9982.689s">Thank</a> God I didn't get it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9984.771s">It</a> wasn't because I didn't want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9988.516s">He</a> opened up the door and to the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10000.67s">Dr.</a> Perrella, really all of the principals have always had an open door. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10008.956s">When</a> I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10014.62s">And</a> I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10017.903s">What</a> is she gonna come up with today? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10019.564s">But</a> all in all, it was just a wonderful ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10023.687s">And</a> I couldn't have done it without the people back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10028.11s">Oh</a> my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10031.999s">When</a> I decided to run, it was a family decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10035.08s">My</a> family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight who probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10045.964s">And</a> Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10050.305s">But</a> other than that, to my husband, to my son, Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who has always been there for me to make me look good back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10060.469s">Work</a> with your minds, but really work with your heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10093.578s">There's</a> no more, I have plenty of life, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10096.328s">This</a> was the relaxing part.<h2><a href="../2017-12-04_81TW9SO-xRE/2017-12-04_81TW9SO-xRE.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 4, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.731s">Well</a> sometimes it depends on the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8341.872s">You</a> might do it if the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8343.253s">It</a> could be someone else that just had their Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8345.494s">Not</a> their Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8346.175s">Their</a> cell phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8347.435s">And</a> were filming too. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8349.116s">Just</a> to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8354.58s">And</a> as my colleague said I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8357.702s">You</a> know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8438.547s">points</a> of information they are very. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8441.569s">Just</a> to address the street alleys. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8445.071s">The</a> question of the discussion actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8447.432s">In</a> my in my came out with a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8452.635s">Cushion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8453.796s">Policy</a> and a probably about. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8456.517s">Six</a> years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8459.819s">That</a> everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.402s">to</a> go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.882s">And</a> I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8472.285s">And</a> that is the coaches have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8474.507s">Administration</a> has to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8475.927s">The</a> students have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8477.468s">The</a> parents have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8479.189s">And</a> at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8484.051s">Nurses</a> the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8493.796s">uh...</a> fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8520.731s">to</a> that trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8521.932s">Gets</a> evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8523.312s">Has</a> to go to a doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8525.133s">Will</a> not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8533.877s">And</a> let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8539.5s">unless</a> that trainer okays you. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8542.481s">And</a> unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8547.222s">It</a> happened on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8548.223s">It</a> happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8553.644s">You</a> know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8556.885s">And,</a> you know, it's like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8558.786s">player</a> always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8562.953s">I'm</a> not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8566.518s">I'm</a> just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11180.089s">First</a> of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11186.256s">The</a> educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11191.382s">So</a> I want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11192.863s">But</a> I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11199.73s">Are</a> there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.133s">Is</a> it weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.954s">Is</a> it, you know, after school, before school, during school? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11208.736s">Why</a> are they doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11209.917s">Are</a> they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11213.6s">Are</a> they doing it because they're bored? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11215.001s">They're</a> doing it because there's peer pressure? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11218.423s">You</a> know, different questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11220.684s">Is</a> there anything like that in the survey?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11229.19s">But</a> I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11236.536s">But</a> I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11240.539s">It's</a> happening after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11241.78s">It's</a> happening, you know, for our students that are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11246.584s">Like,</a> are they doing it more when it's not their season? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11249.706s">You</a> know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11254.89s">Or</a> is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11276.816s">For</a> us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11286.628s">Is</a> it around, you know, is it around final exams? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11289.772s">Is</a> it around MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11291.394s">Is</a> it around the parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11292.755s">You</a> know, there's so many variables, and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11297.04s">We</a> you have done this survey now for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11300.645s">I</a> mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11305.552s">I</a> know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11314.484s">Sometimes</a> there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11318.829s">The</a> other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11332.563s">And</a> then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11336.986s">Have</a> we found those numbers to go up?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11440.683s">I</a> just think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11442.203s">I</a> mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11447.085s">The</a> bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11452.007s">And</a> I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11459.989s">and</a> certain things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11461.812s">And</a> as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11468.501s">That</a> doesn't really happen as much anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11470.664s">Years</a> ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11473.768s">Nowadays,</a> they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11475.33s">But</a> that doesn't mean that <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11476.792s">just</a> because they're not things aren't happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11479.395s">And</a> I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately we have seen situations <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11493.894s">from</a> you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11512.911s">I</a> still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11529.878s">And</a> it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11533.2s">It's</a> really to be more preventative before anything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11538.282s">That's</a> all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11539.623s">And</a> as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11546.346s">My</a> opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11560.911s">And</a> I've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11561.971s">I've</a> seen it this summer especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11563.872s">I've</a> seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11573.815s">And</a> here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11578.256s">Now</a> we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11584.677s">You</a> know, and it's a very, very concerning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11588.278s">I</a> know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11595.103s">You're</a> not allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11597.145s">I</a> just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11606.311s">It's</a> not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11607.312s">It's</a> not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11612.916s">So</a> I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11679.92s">Just</a> two more questions real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11682.281s">One</a> is to both Tony and Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11684.582s">You</a> were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11688.464s">to</a> be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11690.906s">And</a> they know what the next steps are. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11693.288s">But</a> what do the students know? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11694.469s">What</a> are their next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11695.95s">If</a> they're caught with it, what happens?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11712.751s">And</a> I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11721.215s">Like</a> when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11729.6s">Because</a> I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11736.403s">I</a> don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11905.411s">I</a> know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11916.043s">So</a> this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11920.988s">And</a> I know that you've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11921.988s">Yeah,</a> and I know that they've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11924.509s">I</a> just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11942.634s">They</a> don't have to necessarily call you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11945.195s">They</a> can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12870.554s">One</a> more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.095s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.235s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.695s">Actually,</a> I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.464s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.964s">With</a> someone who's been vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12882.546s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12883.366s">Which</a> is very important and it's very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12887.19s">And</a> I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12892.715s">People</a> are aware of how serious that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12895.356s">Because</a> we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.159s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.639s">No</a> one's been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12905.919s">This</a> is, you know, newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12907.46s">So</a> I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14409.295s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14411.777s">I</a> know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14416.301s">But</a> I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14421.746s">When</a> students come to the high school and they speak a different language, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14426.77s">I</a> know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages? <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14441.299s">And</a> the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14449.684s">I</a> remember my teacher actually asking me, <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14452.566s">to</a> see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14459.332s">But</a> at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14469.4s">And</a> I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14471.542s">I</a> don't even know why.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14512.822s">No,</a> I understood that. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14513.963s">I</a> just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14528.115s">You</a> know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14533.038s">You</a> know, to come in and not know the language is even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14536.821s">So</a> I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14544.565s">because</a> it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15222.981s">I</a> mean, prior discretion to the trip.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15255.542s">The</a> only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15339.459s">And</a> that's addressed, like, outside of need.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15871.718s">clarification</a> on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15894.688s">So</a> when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15903.199s">OK,</a> that's where the clarification is. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15904.881s">You're</a> not talking about the parent filling it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15907.124s">You're</a> actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16284.036s">And</a> then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<h2><a href="../2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw/2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 4, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=725.318s">When</a> you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=745.781s">Well,</a> sometimes it depends on the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=747.903s">They</a> might do it if the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=749.344s">It</a> could be someone out there that just had their Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=751.387s">Not</a> their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=755.17s">Just</a> to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=759.695s">okay</a> let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=862.066s">It's</a> been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=867.209s">The</a> ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=883.678s">have</a> to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=891.666s">The</a> only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=900.094s">Fought</a> long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=906.981s">Just</a> to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=922.211s">If</a> by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=931.117s">will</a> not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=939.88s">And</a> let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=947.563s">And,</a> unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=953.204s">It</a> happened on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=954.204s">It</a> happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=959.625s">You</a> know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=962.846s">And,</a> you know, it's like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=964.586s">The</a> player always wants to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=966.226s">But</a> we as adults have to take responsibility, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=968.927s">I'm</a> not blaming the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=970.087s">I'm</a> not blaming our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=971.207s">I'm</a> not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=972.487s">I'm</a> just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=976.848s">No,</a> the superintendent is working with them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3585.798s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.499s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.679s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.359s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.819s">First</a> of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3592.061s">The</a> educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3597.183s">So</a> I want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3598.664s">But</a> I do have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3600.345s">And</a> as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3609.949s">Is</a> it weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3610.77s">Is</a> it, you know, after school, before school, during school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3614.551s">Why</a> are they doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3615.732s">Are</a> they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3619.334s">Are</a> they doing it because they're bored? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3620.815s">They're</a> doing it because there's peer pressure? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3624.237s">You</a> know, different questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3626.498s">Is</a> there anything like that in the survey?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3635.003s">But</a> I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3642.366s">But</a> I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3652.491s">Are</a> they doing it more when it's not their season? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3655.553s">Are</a> they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3660.695s">Or</a> is it for our drama students? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3662.859s">And</a> I'm not picking on clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3664.421s">I'm</a> just saying as examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3666.785s">Is</a> it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3675.979s">that</a> kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3681.243s">And</a> I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3692.431s">Is</a> it around final exams? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3695.593s">Is</a> it around MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3697.214s">Is</a> it around the parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3698.815s">There's</a> so many variables and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3702.857s">We,</a> you have done this survey now for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3705.8s">I</a> mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3711.364s">I</a> know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3720.292s">Sometimes</a> there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3724.655s">The</a> other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3742.829s">Have</a> we found those numbers to go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3744.85s">No,</a> those numbers are very low, actually.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3846.491s">I</a> just think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3848.012s">I</a> mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3857.821s">And</a> I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3865.788s">and</a> certain things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3867.649s">And</a> as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3874.31s">That</a> doesn't really happen as much anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3876.471s">Years</a> ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3879.572s">Nowadays,</a> they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3881.172s">But</a> that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3885.254s">And</a> I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3890.055s">But</a> unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3909.571s">Or</a> gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3914.215s">So</a> just because they're not in a so-called park, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3918.759s">I</a> still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3921.301s">And</a> that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3939.057s">It's</a> really to be more preventative before anything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3943.662s">That's</a> all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3946.044s">And</a> as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3963.197s">Now,</a> like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3966.78s">And</a> I've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3967.821s">I've</a> seen it this summer especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3969.722s">I've</a> seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3979.691s">And</a> here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3984.055s">Now</a> we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3990.517s">You</a> know, and it's a very, very concerning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3994.199s">I</a> know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4000.941s">You're</a> not allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4003.002s">I</a> just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4008.704s">And</a> I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4018.689s">So</a> I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4085.883s">Just</a> two more questions real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4087.985s">One</a> is to both Tony and Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4090.407s">You</a> were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4100.295s">What</a> are their next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4101.776s">If</a> they're caught with it, what happens?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4118.569s">And</a> I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4135.163s">So</a> because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4151.522s">with</a> your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4309.695s">Well,</a> that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4326.769s">And</a> I know that you've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4328.069s">Yeah,</a> and I know that they've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4330.27s">I</a> just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4346.735s">At</a> least they know that, gee, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4348.415s">They</a> don't have to necessarily call you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4350.957s">They</a> can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5274.356s">Is</a> there a motion to receive this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.277s">One</a> more question, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.957s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5277.417s">Actually,</a> I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5288.3s">Yeah,</a> which is very important and it's very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5292.942s">And</a> I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5304.005s">And</a> as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5309.887s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5310.387s">No</a> one's been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5311.648s">This</a> is, you know, newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5313.188s">So</a> I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6814.955s">Esconia,</a> I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6820.217s">You</a> won't have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6821.958s">But</a> I guess I don't know why this has never even come before. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6826.24s">But</a> I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6831.863s">They</a> I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6846.953s">And</a> the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6850.995s">But</a> many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6855.338s">I</a> remember my teacher actually asking me, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6858.22s">to</a> see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6864.985s">But</a> at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6875.032s">And</a> I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6877.133s">I</a> don't even know why.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6918.459s">No,</a> I understood that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6919.561s">I</a> just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6926.732s">And,</a> you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.061s">I</a> mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.782s">You</a> know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6938.705s">You</a> know, to come in and not know the language is even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6942.466s">So</a> I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6949.57s">Because</a> it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6955.613s">but</a> at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7624.148s">Using</a> discretion.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7628.449s">Prior</a> to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7629.569s">Prior</a> discretion to the trip.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7661.144s">The</a> only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7675.671s">until</a> after the deadline.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7745.06s">And</a> that's addressed like at an E.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8277.197s">A</a> clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8278.618s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8279.058s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8283.682s">There</a> is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8290.887s">And</a> so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8300.274s">So</a> when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8308.765s">Okay,</a> that's where the clarification is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8310.446s">You're</a> not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8679.789s">I</a> just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8689.596s">And</a> then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8699.504s">What</a> if they don't even bring it?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8705.531s">That's</a> fine.<h2><a href="../2017-12-04_eOruUd5h8M4/2017-12-04_eOruUd5h8M4.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 4, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=107.406s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=108.046s">No,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=734.233s">When</a> you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=754.679s">Well,</a> sometimes it depends on the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=757.081s">It</a> could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=764.068s">Just</a> to see what type of play. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=765.51s">If</a> there is something out there, at least we could see what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=773.017s">Especially</a> when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=853.494s">Points</a> of information?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.874s">Perry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.794s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.934s">Bonilla?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=856.515s">Just</a> to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=861.856s">Actually,</a> you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=864.137s">The</a> MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=876.141s">The</a> ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=880.722s">themselves,</a> their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=894.087s">And</a> at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=900.57s">The</a> only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=908.973s">fought</a> long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=914.576s">And</a> just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=931.103s">If</a> by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=948.776s">And</a> let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.181s">I'm</a> not blaming the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.821s">I'm</a> not blaming our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=957.801s">I'm</a> not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=959.182s">I'm</a> just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=985.746s">No,</a> the superintendent is working with them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3594.847s">First</a> of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3601.034s">The</a> educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3606.16s">So</a> I want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3607.661s">But</a> I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3614.508s">Are</a> there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3618.891s">Is</a> it weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3619.732s">Is</a> it, you know, after school, before school, during school? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3623.494s">Why</a> are they doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3624.695s">Are</a> they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3628.378s">Are</a> they doing it because they're bored? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3629.779s">They're</a> doing it because there's peer pressure? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3633.201s">You</a> know, different questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3635.462s">Is</a> there anything like that in the survey?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3643.968s">But</a> I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3651.314s">But</a> I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3655.297s">It's</a> happening after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3656.538s">It's</a> happening for our students that are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3661.462s">Are</a> they doing it more when it's not their season? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3664.504s">Are</a> they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3669.648s">Or</a> is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3691.611s">For</a> us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, OK, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3701.374s">Is</a> it around final exams? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3704.536s">Is</a> it around MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3706.156s">Is</a> it around the parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3707.777s">There's</a> so many variables, and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3712.275s">You</a> have done this survey now for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3714.736s">As</a> a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3720.318s">I</a> know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students and why they're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3729.262s">Sometimes</a> there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3733.607s">The</a> other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3747.362s">And</a> then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3751.787s">Have</a> we found those numbers to go up?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3855.441s">I</a> just think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3856.962s">I</a> mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3861.844s">The</a> bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3866.786s">And</a> I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3874.75s">and</a> certain things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3876.591s">And</a> as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3883.272s">That</a> doesn't really happen as much anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3885.453s">Years</a> ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3888.534s">Nowadays,</a> they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3890.114s">But</a> that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3894.195s">And</a> I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3918.551s">Or,</a> gee, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3923.174s">So</a> just because they're not in a so-called park, I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3930.279s">And</a> that's why I was saying if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3939.105s">or</a> anything like that, you know, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3944.67s">And</a> it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3948.013s">It's</a> really to be more preventative before anything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3953.078s">That's</a> all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3955.02s">And</a> as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3961.158s">My</a> opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3972.149s">Now,</a> like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3975.733s">And</a> I've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3976.794s">I've</a> seen it this summer especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3978.296s">I've</a> seen it, like, you know, people just, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3981.099s">smoking</a> it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3988.645s">And</a> here we were years ago saying, well, gee, do you know what secondhand smoking does? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3993.069s">Now</a> we have to explain to our kids, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3999.294s">And</a> it's a very, very concerning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4003.198s">I</a> know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4007.441s">Yes,</a> we can ban it because we ban cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4009.903s">You're</a> not allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4011.965s">I</a> just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4021.132s">It's</a> not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4022.113s">It's</a> not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4027.677s">So</a> I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4092.99s">I'd</a> be very interested to start doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4095.332s">Just</a> two more questions real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4096.953s">One</a> is to both Tony and Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4099.355s">You</a> were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping, to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4106.499s">And</a> they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4109.261s">What</a> are their next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4110.722s">If</a> they're caught with it, what happens?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4127.529s">And</a> I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4144.413s">Because</a> I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out, because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4151.215s">I</a> don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute discussion with the audience?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4320.173s">I</a> know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4330.784s">So</a> this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4335.749s">And</a> I know that you've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4339.993s">For</a> people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, they don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4358.271s">necessarily</a> call you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4359.932s">They</a> can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5283.343s">Is</a> there a motion to receive this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.264s">One</a> more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.805s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.945s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5286.405s">Actually,</a> I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into a vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.172s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.673s">With</a> someone who's been vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5297.274s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5298.115s">Which</a> is very important and it's very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5302.058s">And</a> I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5307.442s">People</a> are aware of how serious that could be because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind and as kids we've been trained in our minds too is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5318.875s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5319.356s">No</a> one's been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5320.637s">This</a> is, you know, newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5322.179s">So</a> I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6823.939s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6824.119s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6826.441s">I</a> know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because we won't have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6830.966s">But</a> I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I'm going to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6836.411s">When</a> students come to the high school and they speak a different language, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6841.435s">I</a> know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6855.963s">And</a> the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy and I remember my teacher actually asking me, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6867.23s">to</a> see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6873.999s">But</a> at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6883.17s">and</a> in English, and I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6886.131s">I</a> don't even know why.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6927.483s">No,</a> I understood that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6928.624s">I</a> just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they just come into a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6942.059s">I</a> mean, you know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6947.765s">to</a> come in and not know the language is even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6951.466s">So</a> I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6958.587s">Because</a> it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6964.609s">But</a> at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7637.809s">Prior</a> discretion to the trip.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7667.342s">The</a> only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7754.089s">And</a> that's addressed, like, at a need.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8286.229s">a</a> clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8309.298s">So</a> when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8317.784s">OK,</a> that's where the clarification is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8319.466s">You're</a> not talking about the parent filling it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8321.707s">You're</a> actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8698.63s">And</a> then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or two months or seven months, they don't even bring it to you.<h2><a href="../2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s/2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 20, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=464.624s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=466.385s">First</a> of all, congratulations, Eva. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=468.105s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=469.706s">I</a> actually participated in that a few years back, and it was just an amazing, amazing day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=477.729s">If</a> you're not involved with it, unfortunately, and we didn't know about it, but I had the opportunity to go down and to see students from all over the state really working together, and what a camaraderie. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=489.513s">for</a> students that really didn't know each other at the beginning of the day to really become very friendly by the end of the day and they were all working really for the cause of a larger community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=500.824s">So</a> I mean it's just amazing and I want to thank you and I also want to thank the other student for representing Medford so well but I have a question for you and that is what is it that you did?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=512.394s">That</a> day.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=519.628s">Oh,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.468s">I</a> am sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.989s">So</a> come back and let us know what you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=522.65s">I</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=523.931s">But</a> congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=524.972s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1459.986s">What's</a> going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1460.806s">Actually,</a> for Miss Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1464.888s">It's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1465.548s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1466.889s">Actually,</a> my question is, well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to all the veterans that come each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1471.41s">As</a> you said, it's been a 17-year program that you've been running. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1475.152s">And</a> it's been fabulous, because I know the students get a lot out of it, just as much as the veterans do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1479.973s">And</a> also, a thank you, if we can, send a letter to Mr. Lindsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1484.655s">Who's</a> the director of the veterans just to just as it as a thank-you note from us? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1489.037s">But</a> the other thing is is that you were speaking of we don't have the veterans anymore from certain errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1494.44s">Is</a> it possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1495.3s">I</a> mean, I don't know this is just to throw it out there, but Maybe invite like children of the veterans from that era that have heard the stories that still have stories to share and just give an insight to our students from that era and
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1570.54s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1571.301s">Oh,</a> you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1572.662s">And</a> also a letter to Mr. Kreatz, who Noah's been an amazing asset to a lot of these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1579.807s">And</a> his enthusiasm and his experience, even though he hasn't, thankfully, gone, but he does have a lot of knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1586.972s">So</a> it's really nice to see a young student who shares that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1590.575s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1591.836s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1640.455s">Give</a> him some donuts? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1643.519s">We'll</a> give him some donuts.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2327.689s">But</a> actually there was one part that Mr. Carlo has missed and that is Sandra also said that she does speak Spanish and because she had the opportunity of taking Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2341.22s">that</a> she fell in love with the language and the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2344.422s">And</a> so that's an important piece, because no matter how many languages we speak as a district, when we have the opportunity, and here I have to say thank you to Cassett, because Cassett is where it starts in the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2357.449s">So,</a> and it continues through the middle schools, and it continues to the high school, and it's a great opportunity for Cassett, but also a great opportunity for us, and to thank all the teachers that have always been involved, so thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3478.577s">Pugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3479.767s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3480.168s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, is there a way for us to find out how the other schools in our area were graded?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3494.575s">But</a> yeah, I'd like to see the list of the surrounding schools and and just in general other schools Yeah, but it doesn't give that information just to see I can get you the rest of it just was a lot of pages No, and I understand that and I'm not asking for the whole report I'm just asking so that way we have an idea of where we rank compared to if it's okay with you What I'll do is I'll pick some area schools and give you you know some comparable type schools like Waltham and Winchester <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3521.243s">And</a> then I guess my other concern is We rate you know according to their standards We rated high does is that jeopardize any type of grant or anything that we're going to be going for because I mean Because we we graded very high based on their requisites I just don't want to jeopardize anything out there that we're waiting for like capital planning money or anything like that I mean are they going to take that into consideration obviously they're going to look at buildings that are for and
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3599.696s">And</a> was the tour across the board, like when they came to the high school, did they see the whole high school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3606.178s">And</a> the same thing with all the other schools?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3625.207s">I</a> just don't want them to say that they went into the science labs at the high school and just assumed that the rest of the school is like that, because it's not.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3636.033s">Keep</a> on telling them that, because it has to go through the whole district.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3641.476s">Yeah,</a> the whole district.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.489s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.689s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4123.35s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4125.291s">Well,</a> I have had the opportunity, and I know what people are going to say out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4129.855s">Oh,</a> you know, the people that always agree with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4133.158s">However,</a> my discussion is not about whether I agree or disagree with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4139.803s">Here</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4140.875s">just</a> a thank you for the person that he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4144.296s">There's</a> been many a times that there are a lot of us that agree or disagree, but this is out of respect, out of respect for the gentleman that's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4152.217s">I've</a> had the opportunity, not only as a Medford School Committee member, but also as a president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to actually go around the state with Mr. Bellson to see how he has represented us, <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4166.26s">always</a> having us top of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4171.663s">I</a> know people agree to disagree, but you really don't know it all when you're not behind this reel, unfortunately, because there are a lot of things that it's amazing to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4183.99s">When</a> I went to the statehouse and there was a discussion and the superintendent went and he testified. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4191.635s">And</a> there were other superintendents there that day that were testifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4195.056s">It's</a> amazing to see the amount of people that after they're done with their discussion, the reporters and other people from the state house, all those superintendents were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4207.721s">Everybody</a> went to Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4209.642s">Who</a> did he talk about? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4211.443s">He</a> talked about the people in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4213.623s">Not</a> only the students and the parents, but the teachers and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4218.527s">Again,</a> I don't want to talk about agreeing or disagreeing, because that's why we're here, to be respectful behind and in front of the reel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4228.636s">This</a> is where you come to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4230.617s">This</a> is where you come to express what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4238.264s">It's</a> funny, Paulette just said something about he'll answer that phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4242.621s">when</a> he's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4244.264s">And</a> I remember 12 years ago when I started and I wanted to bring the summer program into fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4251.717s">I</a> remember going to that school the first day, and we had tons of kids there with parents dropping them off, and of course it was the hottest day, and the summer hadn't even started, and the people in charge had shut the air conditioning on me, and I called him, and he answered, and I'm like, I am sorry, but, and I went into a rage, and he's like, don't worry, he's like, the second I get off the plane, because I'm stepping on the plane, he says, I will call, and that air conditioning was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4281.507s">So</a> it's things like that that you remember, but honestly when I've had the opportunity to go around the state and I've had the opportunity nationally to tell people that we've had superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4292.548s">It's</a> amazing, because they say, what do you mean you have a superintendent who's been there all these years? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4296.971s">You're</a> lucky if you get someone who stays with you two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4299.994s">And</a> I've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4301.294s">I've</a> seen it in the communities around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4303.476s">Right</a> now, it's very difficult to get someone who's very qualified, because the candidate pool is not that large. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.034s">It's</a> just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.995s">And</a> when people tell me you work with a school committee, or you work as a school committee, or you actually speak to your superintendent, again, it seemed very strange to me, because I just assumed this is how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4325.442s">I</a> am in total shock when I hear other school committee members across the state that tell me, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4332.146s">What</a> do you mean you have community participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4334.788s">I'm</a> like, well, that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4336.809s">We're</a> here for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4337.87s">They</a> should have participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4339.571s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4340.411s">They're</a> not allowed to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4342.38s">And</a> so there are things that we just assume as a school committee member, as a parent, as a teacher, administrator, what we're used to sometimes, we're just assuming this is how it is across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4354.868s">And</a> we're always complaining about what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4357.469s">But</a> when you have the opportunity to go outside your city and to see what other things and other people are doing and other cities and towns are doing, again, there's always improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4366.935s">The</a> bar is always raised up high. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4368.937s">But</a> to see where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4371.4s">is</a> just really, you know, it's, I'm very happy to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4376.189s">And</a> I have to say that it's people like the superintendent who go out there with their passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4382.157s">and</a> get what we have, because it's not that easy sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4385.638s">So</a> I want to say thank you to the superintendent.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.355s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.615s">Cugno,</a> I just wanted to acknowledge, actually, Mr. John Costas from the Medford Electric for the donation of installations of many of the lights at the Marsha Caron Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4705.885s">The</a> lighting that he just put in, he donated everything, and the lights that we have now will enhance the stage and the theatre itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4714.43s">So</a> I just wanted to see if we could invite Mr. Costa for... He does a lot more than just that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4723.124s">Yeah,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4724.645s">Well,</a> this was given to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4725.685s">I'm</a> just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4727.346s">But</a> if we could just invite him the next time we have a meeting.<h2><a href="../2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0/2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0.html">Medford City Council Candidates Forum 10/18/17</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1135.05s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1136.011s">Thank</a> you to the Democratic Board Committee and to all of you for coming here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1140.174s">My</a> name is Ann Marie Cuno. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1142.075s">I</a> graduated and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in foreign languages and in criminal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1147.439s">As</a> a lifelong resident of Medford, along with my husband, Michael, we were married after graduation, and we've been married for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1155.164s">We</a> have four sons, and they have all graduated from the Medford public school system, pursuing their careers and education, continuing on their road to success. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1164.435s">I've</a> been on the Medford School Committee for the past 12 years and served as president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, a position which allowed me the opportunity to work on state and national levels, continuing to represent Medford on discussions of important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1182.143s">Why</a> am I seeking city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1183.824s">For</a> the same reason I ran for school committee, to make constructive changes and a positive difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1190.737s">During</a> my tenure of the Medford School Committee, I introduced changes and presented fresh ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1196.887s">Collectively</a> passed many successful programs along with my committee colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1202.479s">We</a> approved and implemented changes ranging from technology to building upgrades and educational programs, some utilizing state and federal grants to underwrite the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1213.548s">I</a> have worked and collaborated with local, state, and federal elected officials, appointed to the state local government committee with both Governors Patrick and Governor Baker, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1224.577s">Advocated</a> in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1226.398s">for</a> the Massachusetts Federal Relations Network Delegation, meeting with members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican alike, while always having time to meet with our students, parents and teachers and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1240.986s">Replying</a> honestly to all and keeping true to myself, building consensus along the way, and at times agreeing to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1250.391s">As</a> a city councilor, I will bring the same positive changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1254.356s">We</a> as elected officials need to make the correct, non-partisan decisions on the issues, not based on the party line or a special group, but based on what is beneficial for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1267.62s">We</a> have a master plan, but now it is time to implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1271.902s">There</a> is a lot of discussions about the revitalization of Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1276.603s">The</a> talk needs to stop, and we need to make it a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1282.695s">in</a> this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1283.895s">We</a> need to take pride in our city by starting with cleanup for all retail squares, such as off hours, trash removal in the retail areas, upgrade the lighting to be brighter and more inviting. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1296.498s">With</a> Chevalier Theatre partnering with Professional Management Company, we have a window of opportunity to make the heart of our city, Medford Square, more appealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1305.555s">welcoming</a> upscale stores, art galleries, restaurants, adding affordable housing, a proper city parking facility, and maybe even a movie theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1314.839s">Our</a> neighborhoods also need attention, not only the streets and the sidewalks, but proper planning in our zoning to keep our city a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1324.262s">Comprehensive</a> plan to repair our streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1327.223s">All</a> the city streets, we need to hold contractors to a higher standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1332.405s">They</a> need to return our streets to safe and passable ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1336.447s">Anything</a> less is not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1339.068s">Making</a> our city into the vibrant, exciting and upcoming city it can and it will become, just as the ones around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1348.312s">We</a> need to incorporate the appeal of our city to all ages, including our children, by giving them an opportunity to want to return to an affordable and vibrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1358.427s">Let</a> me ask, what has changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1361.091s">The</a> amount of land in the square has not shrunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1364.242s">Our</a> family and community values have not vanished. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1367.823s">I</a> am aware we do not have the amount of land space that other cities have, but with a comprehensive plan, we have enough space to get to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1376.885s">By</a> doing so, the other jewels of our city will also benefit, such as Haines Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1383.318s">West</a> Medford, the Hillside, Wellington, Glenwood, in all our entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1389.599s">Revisit</a> the parking issue, making it sensible for all, providing a more concise and transparent program. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1396.501s">We</a> need to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1398.322s">Under</a> these circumstances, things will not change over at night, and it will take time, but it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1405.103s">We</a> cannot afford for discussions to continue based on who to blame instead of going forward in a positive and a productive manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1413.385s">I</a> am a candidate who votes on the issue, not a promise for the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1418.748s">I</a> am a proven candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1421.009s">I</a> have made changes, not just by talking, but by rolling up my sleeves and getting the work done, which in itself makes me a uniquely qualified candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1431.113s">Continue</a> bringing new ideas, integrity, hard work, and passion to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1436.196s">It</a> will positively impact our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1439.017s">I</a> ask for your trust in me and your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1441.877s">Number</a> 10 on the Medford City ballot.<h2><a href="../2017-10-18_GPyVAF2hz_Q/2017-10-18_GPyVAF2hz_Q.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 16, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=886.048s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.028s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.249s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=888.095s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=889.016s">First</a> and foremost, thank you and congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=892.3s">This</a> is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=894.422s">These</a> are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=901.189s">Miss</a> Westmark, nope, I have to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=905.932s">I've</a> known her before she was married. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=908.533s">So</a> just to say thank you to you for all that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=912.215s">I</a> was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city that it would really be beneficial I think and speaking to others that I think this would go hand in hand <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=926.765s">if</a> we're able to put our students into the community and have them have some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=937.668s">We</a> have a hotel in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=940.709s">We</a> have different types of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=943.829s">So</a> I'd like to see, if possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=950.592s">maybe</a> a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students, and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=962.974s">So</a> if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=970.636s">We</a> have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=974.996s">But</a> I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=979.182s">I</a> don't want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields, but if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=988.951s">They</a> can't just always do everything voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=991.554s">So</a> I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1035.857s">And</a> even if it's something that if the students can't do during the day, because I know they have a lot on their plates and you don't want to lose any time in classes, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1044.587s">Maybe</a> there's something that could be worked out like after school or maybe in a Saturday or if the business is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1051.111s">But</a> again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1056.014s">I</a> just don't want to see kids, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1060.778s">Not</a> that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1065.42s">Because</a> I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1069.723s">and</a> they want to pursue, or if it's something they thought they were interested in and they want to go to a different field altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1074.605s">I</a> love it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2118.807s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.689s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.889s">Cugno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2120.73s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2122.331s">First</a> of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2133.439s">But</a> I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2142.423s">And</a> so we brought in a lot of forums, not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2147.83s">I</a> think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2154.337s">You</a> know, trying to tell <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2156.75s">children</a> all the time or anyone just to be careful what you write you know I get it all the time the snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes I want to know from you what have you learned as far as like these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and they disappear have you now had a different way of thinking about that yeah.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2195.642s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2197.862s">I'm</a> really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2202.503s">As</a> my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2209.548s">It's</a> important that your peers hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2212.612s">Sometimes,</a> as adults, we'll say it and, oh, no, it's not true, or you don't know about it, or you have no idea about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2219.141s">I</a> know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2224.442s">Actually,</a> that was one of the biggest things is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards and the employers are looking into everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2237.167s">So,</a> it has to be something that you really, I hope, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2241.308s">will</a> continue bringing to your peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2243.73s">And</a> every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2252.598s">Because</a> even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2257.602s">You</a> really have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2258.283s">And</a> actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2264.688s">So</a> thank you for representing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2266.71s">Thank</a> you for absorbing <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2268.401s">what</a> they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2272.408s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.013s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.914s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2762.094s">Cuno,</a> before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2771.835s">And</a> I think it's really very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2775.256s">I'm</a> going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2782.14s">And</a> to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2791.343s">So</a> it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2807.647s">Petersburg,</a> Istanbul, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2810.349s">Hyderabad,</a> Accra, and Kurskov. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2814.591s">So</a> when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2821.354s">So</a> I think it's very important that we have representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2825.616s">And</a> with that, do I have to make a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2829.357s">Motion</a> for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2830.278s">So</a> motion to approve that the superintendent.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3065.276s">I</a> just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3069.501s">And</a> so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3077.009s">So</a> with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent go and Mr. Zizek go, if discussion comes, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3085.602s">up</a> in as far as what will be done in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3088.985s">Maybe</a> they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3099.373s">As</a> you said, it's only been four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3101.134s">I</a> don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on that Mr. Azuz will go before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3108.9s">Not</a> to Europe.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3115.204s">The</a> teleconference I knew of.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3128.544s">I</a> just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3137.727s">How</a> has that worked?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.557s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.737s">Cugno,</a> could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Martinello, please, and his family? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3476.882s">And</a> Mr. Skerry? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3478.223s">Well,</a> we're saying thank you to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3480.305s">We'll</a> save some paper, and we'll say thank you in person.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4784.451s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.552s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.732s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4786.913s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Chesteri. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4789.376s">Could</a> you tell me what type of feedback you've received? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4791.999s">Have</a> any of the teachers been involved in any of this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4894.615s">The</a> 48 teachers that were involved, are they even across the board?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4922.373s">What</a> have the teachers heard from the students as far as feedback?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4940.816s">Any</a> feedback from parents?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5002.483s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5003.363s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5192.839s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5193.299s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5194.1s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5195.12s">I'm</a> looking at the co-op employers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5197.482s">Is</a> that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5208.182s">Okay,</a> because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like, construction doesn't have anything?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5221.034s">Okay,</a> what about business, tech, and marketing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.276s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.816s">Business,</a> tech, and marketing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5230.565s">OK,</a> and the same thing with the graphic arts? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5232.306s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5233.167s">OK,</a> and the media? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5234.928s">Media</a> tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5238.43s">Not</a> necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5239.07s">It</a> could be internships and co-ops. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5240.411s">It</a> could be outside.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.554s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.734s">All</a> right, thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5324.39s">To</a> be a delegate or an alternate?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5338.301s">or</a> not, but to really try to get to the conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5342.326s">There's</a> a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5356.042s">There</a> are vendors there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5357.023s">There</a> are opportunities on workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5359.065s">There's</a> really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5365.848s">I</a> know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5377.274s">There's</a> a lot more involved than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5379.655s">There's</a> a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5383.142s">for</a> our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5387.585s">There's</a> a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5397.451s">I'm</a> not saying we don't know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5398.872s">I'm</a> just saying it's always good to learn more.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6225.315s">Well,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6226.116s">You're</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.357s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.577s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6228.572s">Just</a> for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6254.215s">So</a> we are down at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6256.255s">We've</a> been down since what we've had in the past, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6260.876s">So</a> you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6296.426s">But</a> the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6303.405s">office</a> was located, which was at the moment.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.583s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.924s">So</a> at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6329.339s">the</a> Councilors from the other schools or the BCP from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6337.703s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6806.543s">Say</a> if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6842.651s">As</a> long as we make sure we put something, because I know that there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with the same child or even with older children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6854.614s">So</a> at least they can get an understanding of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.515s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.895s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7027.523s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7028.324s">I</a> know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7035.907s">Or</a> were they granted because we went back and forth with this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7082.673s">And</a> they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7087.619s">I</a> know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7090.94s">I</a> mean, if they're taking these MCAS in the ninth grade, and then all of a sudden, the 10th grade, it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7096.881s">I</a> mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7099.642s">Because</a> I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7103.663s">So</a> I mean, I just hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7105.903s">I</a> mean, I know I've been on the boards with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7107.964s">I</a> know how they change their things overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7110.564s">But</a> I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7114.165s">try</a> to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th grade and then all of a sudden we change it overnight on them and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7128.568s">So</a> I just want our eyes and ears open for that because I'm sure, I mean I know the administration does, I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=877.645s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.646s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.846s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=879.707s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=880.627s">First</a> and foremost, thank you and congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=883.91s">This</a> is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=886.031s">These</a> are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=893.136s">Westmark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=897.559s">I've</a> known her before she was married. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=900.141s">So</a> just to say thank you to you for all that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=904.524s">I</a> was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=911.568s">that</a> it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=936.329s">My</a> concentration went away, but different types of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=939.771s">So</a> I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=954.604s">So</a> if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=962.003s">You</a> know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=966.626s">But</a> I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=970.788s">I</a> want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=974.591s">But</a> if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=980.555s">They</a> can't just always do everything voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=983.156s">So</a> I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1027.488s">And</a> even if it's something that if the students can't do during <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1034.3s">I</a> don't know if there's any time in classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1036.381s">Maybe</a> there's something that could be worked out like after school, or maybe in a Saturday, or if the business is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1048.098s">want</a> to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1052.423s">Not</a> that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue or if it's something they thought they were interested in.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2110.441s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.339s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.519s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2112.359s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2113.98s">First</a> of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't a hundred percent sure before we started the meeting and I sat down with you really quick, but I would have asked you a thousand questions because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do is it was the anti-bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2134.065s">And</a> so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2137.38s">and</a> not only our students, but for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2140.242s">I</a> think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2145.967s">You</a> know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2152.252s">You</a> know, I get it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2153.573s">The</a> Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2155.994s">I</a> want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes, and then they disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2164.361s">Have</a> you now had a different, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2167.252s">way</a> of thinking about that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2189.087s">I</a> am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2194.128s">As</a> my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2201.19s">It's</a> important that, you know, your peers hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2204.251s">Sometimes</a> as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2211.553s">I</a> know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2228.801s">So</a> it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2235.387s">And</a> every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2245.396s">Even</a> if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.238s">You</a> really have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.918s">And</a> actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2256.302s">So</a> thank you for representing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2258.343s">Thank</a> you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2264.066s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.558s">very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.858s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.938s">Cuno,</a> before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2763.482s">And</a> I think it's really very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2766.923s">I'm</a> going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2781.369s">opportunity</a> for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2782.97s">So</a> it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2799.295s">Petersburg,</a> Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2806.257s">So</a> when we're looking and we're hearing at these, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2810.298s">I</a> mean, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2812.439s">Um,</a> so I think it's very important that we have representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2817.262s">And,</a> um, with that, do I have to make a motion for approval?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3056.941s">I</a> just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3061.162s">And</a> so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3068.645s">So</a> with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3075.308s">You</a> know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3091.034s">As</a> you said, it's only been four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3092.814s">I</a> don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3120.22s">I</a> just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3129.392s">How</a> has that worked?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.215s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.415s">Cugno,</a> could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3468.58s">And</a> Mr. Skerry? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3469.901s">We're</a> saying thank you to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3471.982s">We'll</a> save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4775.585s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.266s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.406s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4778.646s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4781.087s">Could</a> you tell me what type of feedback you've received? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4783.847s">Have</a> any of the teachers been involved in
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4889.892s">even</a> across the board.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4932.522s">Any</a> feedback from parents?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.549s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.729s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5186.851s">I'm</a> looking at the co-op employers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5189.193s">Is</a> that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5199.883s">Okay,</a> because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5207.264s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5212.605s">Okay,</a> what about business, tech, and marketing? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5214.986s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5215.506s">Business,</a> tech, and marketing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5222.32s">Okay,</a> and the same thing with the graphic arts? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5224.862s">Okay,</a> and the media? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5226.643s">Media</a> tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5230.785s">It</a> could be internships and co-ops.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5236.529s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5237.429s">All</a> right, thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5329.994s">or</a> not, but to really try to get to the conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5334.037s">There's</a> a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5347.745s">There</a> are vendors there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5348.726s">There</a> are opportunities on workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5350.787s">There's</a> really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5357.57s">I</a> know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5368.995s">There's</a> a lot more involved than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5371.376s">There's</a> a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5374.858s">for</a> our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5379.281s">There's</a> a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5389.167s">I'm</a> not saying we don't know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5390.608s">I'm</a> just saying it's always good to learn more.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.119s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.319s">Cugno,</a> just for a clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6245.991s">So</a> we are down at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6248.033s">We've</a> been down since what we've had in the past, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6252.636s">So</a> you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6288.191s">But</a> the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6315.663s">So</a> at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6798.359s">Say</a> if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6834.315s">As</a> long as we can make sure we put something. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6835.976s">Cause</a> I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6846.525s">So</a> at least they could get an understanding of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.227s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.407s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7019.422s">Apologize.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7020.243s">I</a> know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7028.53s">Cause</a> I went back and forth with this.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7137.208s">Yeah,</a> and it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7138.049s">It's</a> not fair to those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7139.109s">It's</a> not fair to anybody, but those students especially.<h2><a href="../2017-10-16_7DUlBp6f_Us/2017-10-16_7DUlBp6f_Us.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Oct. 16, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1514.214s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.135s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.395s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1516.255s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1517.176s">First</a> and foremost, thank you and congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1520.457s">This</a> is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1522.578s">These</a> are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1529.682s">Westmark,</a> nope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1534.105s">I've</a> known her before she was married. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1536.686s">So</a> just to say thank you to you for all that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1541.068s">I</a> was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1548.132s">that</a> it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1572.538s">my</a> concentration went away, but different types of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1576.319s">So</a> I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1591.141s">So</a> if you have like people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field or, you know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1607.343s">I</a> want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1611.154s">But</a> if it's something down the road.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1664.052s">And</a> even if it's something that if the students can't do during <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1679.259s">But</a> again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1684.164s">I</a> just don't want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1688.969s">Not</a> that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1693.594s">Because</a> I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue, or if it's something
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2745.94s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.062s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.948s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.148s">Cugno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.969s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2750.591s">First</a> of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2761.682s">But</a> I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2770.676s">And</a> so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2776.863s">I</a> think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2782.59s">You</a> know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2788.857s">You</a> know, I get it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2790.178s">The</a> Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2792.601s">I</a> want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and then they disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2800.968s">Have</a> you now had a different way of thinking about that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2825.677s">I</a> am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2830.741s">As</a> my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2837.807s">It's</a> important that, you know, your peers hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2840.87s">Sometimes</a> as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2848.156s">I</a> know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2865.397s">So</a> it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2871.986s">And</a> every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2881.999s">Even</a> if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2885.84s">You</a> really have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2886.52s">And</a> actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2892.902s">So</a> thank you for representing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2894.943s">Thank</a> you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2900.665s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.154s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.495s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.595s">Cuno,</a> before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also, the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3400.077s">And</a> I think it's really very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3403.518s">I'm</a> going to go through them really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3405.62s">But</a> to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3419.569s">So</a> it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Brazil, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3427.034s">I'm</a> sorry, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3435.881s">Petersburg,</a> Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3442.847s">So</a> when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3449.593s">So</a> I think it's very important that we have representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3456.743s">Do</a> I have to make a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3457.584s">Motion</a> for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3458.525s">So</a> motion to approve that the superintendent goes.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3689.996s">Can</a> I just follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3693.553s">I</a> just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3697.754s">And</a> so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3705.236s">So</a> with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3711.918s">You</a> know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3727.651s">As</a> you said, it's only been four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3729.433s">I</a> don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3756.813s">I</a> just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3766.004s">How</a> has that worked?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4097.858s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4098.058s">Cugno,</a> could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4105.223s">And</a> Mr. Skerry? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4106.524s">We're</a> saying thank you to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4108.625s">We'll</a> save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5412.919s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.0s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.16s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5415.36s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Chesteri. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5417.821s">Could</a> you tell me what type of feedback you've received? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5420.583s">Have</a> any of the teachers been involved in any of this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5526.619s">even</a> across the board?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5569.26s">Any</a> feedback from parents?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.282s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.442s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5822.524s">I'm</a> looking at the co-op employers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5825.909s">Is</a> that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5836.633s">Okay,</a> because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5849.484s">Okay,</a> what about business, tech, and marketing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5851.726s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5852.266s">Business,</a> tech, and marketing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5859.065s">Okay,</a> and the same thing with the graphic arts? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5861.586s">Okay,</a> and the media? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5863.366s">Media</a> tech, I'm assuming will be utilizing our media? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5866.847s">No,</a> not necessarily.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5874.148s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5966.735s">or</a> not, but to really try to get to the conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5970.756s">There's</a> a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5984.499s">There</a> are vendors there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5985.48s">There</a> are opportunities on workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5987.54s">There's</a> really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5994.328s">I</a> know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6003.519s">or</a> it's a particular city that tries to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6005.76s">There's</a> a lot more involved than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6008.121s">There's</a> a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state for our positions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6012.943s">The</a> Roberts Rules of Order, there's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6025.909s">I'm</a> not saying we don't know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6027.35s">I'm</a> just saying it's always good to learn more.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6855.914s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6856.114s">Cugno,</a> just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6882.767s">So</a> we are down at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6884.808s">We've</a> been down since what we've had in the past, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6889.409s">So</a> you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6923.988s">Okay,</a> so then, but the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6952.441s">So</a> at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7435.174s">Say</a> if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7471.126s">As</a> long as we can make sure we put something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7472.808s">Cause</a> I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7483.357s">So</a> at least they could get an understanding of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7486.239s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7656.421s">Apologize.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7657.061s">I</a> know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7665.323s">Cause</a> I went back and forth with this.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1877.868s">But</a> if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1880.331s">Because</a> she said they missed school today because she didn't want to drop them.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1275.829s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1277.891s">First</a> of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1282.79s">I'm</a> reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1287.412s">And</a> I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1299.556s">Yes,</a> they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1300.536s">But</a> on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1306.778s">in</a> proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work, and it's currently in certain places. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1314.227s">One</a> of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1318.512s">However,</a> it does say that the parent who is in North Andover, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1324.768s">Refuses</a> to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1331.41s">So</a> two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1352.142s">then</a> the parents would come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1355.465s">But</a> here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1404.938s">including</a> Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield and Redding, which is much closer than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1410.063s">And</a> again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1418.971s">So</a> that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1436.647s">So</a> why should she have to give on anything, but you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1443.053s">No,</a> but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1453.202s">that</a> you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1460.968s">I'm</a> reading it from the documentation that you provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1463.63s">So</a> if there's any other, you know.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.562s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.762s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2039.423s">Thank</a> you, Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2045.102s">You</a> had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, the children could go to school Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2052.067s">Five</a> days a week.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2063.635s">So</a> what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2074.751s">And</a> then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2078.114s">Even</a> if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2083.98s">I</a> mean, I'm really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2085.541s">Do</a> we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2111.288s">But</a> if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get, like, because you said they missed school today, because she didn't want to drop them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2116.772s">This</a> is beyond you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4189.104s">It</a> was one of my biggest, it was one of my things on my to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4193.206s">And</a> as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4197.07s">And</a> like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4202.255s">So</a> it has proved itself many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4206.378s">So</a> I'm very proud of that program.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4210.943s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4211.503s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=723.762s">Over</a> the years, that's been something that we've always, as a committee, we've discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=728.065s">That</a> we have a jewel in this city, that we do have a vocational school, and we do have a high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=734.749s">The</a> goal was, and as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=736.47s">Kreatz</a> has pointed out, the goal was is to give the opportunities to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=742.093s">Whether</a> they go over to the vocational side or our students from the vocational side go over to our high school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=749.264s">But</a> as far as the changes that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=751.627s">Kreatz</a> is discussing tonight, I have to say I'm really surprised because with <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=757.075s">The</a> changes, we also made it very clear that we understood the codes that need to be changed because of the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=764.185s">But</a> we also knew the uniqueness of this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=767.369s">And</a> so listening to all of a sudden the ranking being changed and no valedictorian and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=776.107s">Those</a> are things that are very, very concerning, not only as parents or school committee members, but take us out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=782.112s">Think</a> of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=783.273s">Think</a> of the students that are, especially students that are juniors and seniors this year, that have been thinking of this their whole entire time that they've been up at the high school or have heard of the high school and what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=794.041s">If</a> we're going to go down an avenue to make, bless you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=798.624s">If</a> we're going to go down an avenue that takes us that way, this is, as you just mentioned, we are going to have the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=806.589s">I</a> actually second Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=807.57s">Cress'</a> motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=809.491s">It</a> has to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=810.752s">We</a> can't just expect our students to come in in September and all of a sudden everything changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=815.114s">If</a> we're going to be changing these things, we need to figure out which ones that need to be changed gradually. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=822.409s">Let's</a> grandfather the students that have been pertaining to this, that it pertains to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=827.353s">If</a> this is something that we're going to change as far as the valedictorian or the grades or our guidance Councilor being on the other side of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=835.2s">These</a> are things that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=836.761s">It</a> can't be discussed or just written in a letter and just sent home or just told on a morning that our students are coming to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=843.746s">It's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=845.888s">So</a> I am happy that-
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=882.215s">You</a> know, I just want to say again, we've already discussed that we're going to have to have a committee of the whole make it really clear out there to our parents and our students are teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=893.568s">that</a> before, I mean, all this is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=895.889s">We</a> really need to have a discussion, and it has to be an open discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=899.41s">There</a> are things that are going on in the school system that, you know, we don't know, that maybe parents are not aware of, so the discussion has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=907.753s">And</a> I hope that parents, you know, come to the table, and students come to the table, bringing their concerns, and we could really have a discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=916.335s">Because</a> again, the whole point of really going forward with this was the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=921.617s">We</a> have a jewel, it is a very different type of situation and thrilled that especially our vocational students have the opportunities because a lot of them are going off to college that have the same type of opportunities and they're not taking night courses and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=935.161s">But</a> in the same way, we have to be sensitive in making sure that we're not taking everything away from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=941.322s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.292s">Just</a> a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.992s">Actually,</a> to go back on the report that the superintendent just read off, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1959.736s">As</a> my colleague actually mentioned just a little while ago, just to go back real quick on the high school and vocational side. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1966.238s">I</a> do urge that we have the committee of the whole sooner rather than later, because there has been tremendous work done by all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1978.662s">And</a> I don't want the information that we got out tonight to really impair that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1984.905s">So</a> instead of having rumors and things going around like wild and rampant, I really do hope that we can have this meeting of a whole as quickly as possible so that way we can work on this and that we can discuss what really is going on and what changes are going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2002.673s">The</a> other thing is I was just looking at the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2006.735s">I</a> know that when we were looking at it, at budget time there was approximately 50 students, more at the Andrews than the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2013.159s">And</a> I thought we were going to try to work something out to maybe even that out a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2017.721s">So</a> there could be some clarification on that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3918.645s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.405s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.606s">Cuno,</a> I apologize if any of my colleagues have already said this, but it's kind of hard to hear a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3927.07s">I</a> know that the discussion came up with bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3930.692s">And</a> I'm not sure which schools we were talking about or if we were discussing- That was the kids' corner bathroom.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3947.983s">Well,</a> I know in the past couple of years we've actually concentrated on the elementary schools, the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3953.907s">I'm</a> not 100% sure if we've done anything really big in the high school bathrooms.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4031.749s">I'm</a> sorry, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4032.51s">Again,</a> I don't know if it's the microphones, the speakers in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4035.493s">It</a> sounds loud out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4036.574s">It's</a> really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4038.536s">It's</a> very muffled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4040.018s">I</a> just want to know, as far as the high school ones, because I know that when we've taken our walks and our tours in all the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4046.885s">You</a> know, we've looked at everything, but I'm not 100% sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4050.026s">I</a> mean, as far as I know, the bathrooms in the high school, I wasn't really sure if we've updated them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4054.148s">I</a> know we've cleaned them and we've painted them, but I mean, is there a plan out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4058.21s">Is</a> there something out there that we could really look at the high school ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4060.951s">Because</a> I know those have been the ones that have been kind of in the wayside for a while.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5138.366s">Actually,</a> to go back to that, I would suggest the link only because they change their schedule many times, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5145.974s">And</a> the last thing you want to do is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5149.217s">It's</a> our responsibility for our students, but we also don't want to let our parents go on to like a schedule that we have that all of a sudden the MBTA changes yesterday or the day, you know, and we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5160.619s">So</a> I think the link is probably our best bet on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5163.42s">The</a> other thing is I do want to say thank you to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5165.88s">I</a> know I called you for a few things and you took care of that, the particular routes very quickly for us and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5174.162s">The</a> other thing is basically going back to the telephones and that is, I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5180.244s">where</a> I work, it's very difficult sometimes because people do change their cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5185.167s">Because</a> some people change it because they just get rid of one and they go into another depending on the plan they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5192.392s">So</a> I guess especially for the high school, and Dr. Perla, you're here, not to put you on the spot, but I think it would also be good if <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5200.958s">Parents</a> knew that if they were changing their telephones, or their numbers, or their emails, that they don't have to wait just for that form at the beginning of the year, or a form at the end of the year, because there are different things that happen during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5216.615s">someone</a> could lose their phone and they're borrowing someone else's phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5219.438s">So</a> I think it's important that the responsibility is definitely on us, and I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5224.122s">But</a> I also know that it's very important that if a parent does change their telephone number, if there's a different number that they want us to contact, that they really do need to have that communication with the high school, the vocational school, to let us know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5240.595s">I</a> don't know if it would be involved in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5242.217s">Is</a> that something that we could go on to school brains for?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5250.012s">Because</a> the parents can't go on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5252.473s">Parents</a> can go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5253.353s">I</a> have an idea.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5382.182s">The</a> other thing is that yes, we have school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5385.125s">Yes,</a> everybody's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5386.507s">No,</a> I shouldn't say everyone's working on it because there are parents that feel comfortable on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5390.272s">There's</a> parents that don't feel comfortable on it and that's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5393.516s">With</a> time, hopefully it gets better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5395.857s">But</a> again, not everyone has access. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5398.077s">So</a> I just want the word to be out there that yes, we have the school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5401.058s">Yes,</a> you could go on with a click. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5402.818s">But</a> if you just happen to be going to work and you just have that two minutes waiting for a bus, that you want to contact the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5411.06s">Contact</a> the school, let them know that you're updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5414.743s">telephone</a> number is and that way hopefully we can get the communication on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5419.588s">The</a> other thing is too is the robocalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5422.371s">I</a> know as a parent and my kids were in the school system, I got them all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5427.397s">As</a> a school committee member, I'd still like to be on there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6505.822s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6506.043s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6508.064s">I</a> know emotions are getting high and for every right, but the thing is that I guess I'm looking at this in different ways and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6517.962s">We're</a> not waiting or just personally as a school committee member, I'm not waiting on just what the superintendent is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6526.968s">At</a> this point in time, we're talking about legal papers with laws and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6531.751s">That</a> is why we have our legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6534.133s">That</a> is why we made sure today that Mr. Greenspan would speak to your attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6539.536s">I</a> guess my question is, is that you're saying that it doesn't say the North Reading School or North Andover School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6547.043s">But</a> it does say, with consideration resolving issues and pending, and you and your partner come to a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6558.474s">Can</a> I ask at least what your partner wants? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6561.896s">Does</a> she want them in North Andover? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6565.638s">I'm</a> sorry, X, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6567.719s">I'm</a> sorry, I apologize.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6592.838s">OK,</a> so then I guess at this point in time, if our hands are tied, then could I ask Mr. Greenspan, is it possible, I know that you were working or speaking to their attorney, but <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6604.184s">It</a> depends, I guess, on how you're reading this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6606.366s">So</a> is there any way that you could call, I mean, I don't know, the Attorney General or someone just to find out what the clarification on this is?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6617.073s">So</a> the bottom line is this is how it is being interpreted and this is how we have to abide by because it's a law.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6698.427s">just</a> basically that and I do think that it would probably be a good idea for you to do it so that way at least the parents really you know and we ask <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6712.684s">I</a> mean, if there's any type of loophole that even temporarily, if that's something that would be agreed upon, at least we could do something so the children don't stay out of school all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6722.874s">But</a> in also a confirmation for us that if it's something that we really can't touch because of the law and the way it's written, at least it will confirm on our side too.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6746.705s">Right,</a> but with all due respect, because there is a rule saying where you lay your head, and it is very specific that it's knowledge that the children are here five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6758.632s">There's</a> nothing for them to make a decision on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6761.666s">They're</a> not in their city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6763.748s">And</a> that is the reason why they can't even make a decision for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6767.051s">It's</a> a mute decision because there's nothing for them to make a decision on.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6778.122s">So,</a> do I have the kids going, I mean, for the time being at least.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7359.928s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7364.117s">Looking</a> over the changes, I have to be honest, the one that I don't mind any of the other changes, and I totally understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7372.08s">I</a> mean, I was on the site council when a lot of this was changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7377.182s">But</a> the one I do have a hard time with, and I hear that students are doing it, whatever, so let's continue doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7385.485s">But</a> the rule was that you couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7387.566s">And</a> that is, they may be used in hallways during passing time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7395.209s">The</a> hallways are crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7397.45s">And</a> having these students on their phones just trying to like go from one class to another plus being on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7404.074s">I</a> mean, I get that they were, you know, you hear people say, well, they do it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7408.556s">Well,</a> the fact remains is that they weren't supposed to do it in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7413.539s">That</a> they may be used during the lunch periods in designated student areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7416.901s">I</a> totally understand that because as you mentioned, not all students sometimes are in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7422.003s">And</a> they are in different places, and I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7424.524s">I</a> do have a problem with the one that the students could just be walking around during class time in between going from class to class and being on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7433.789s">And</a> I also am worried about their safety issues, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7436.47s">I</a> mean, going up and down stairs, I see it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7438.971s">I</a> see adults doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7440.712s">I</a> mean, I'll be driving, and they're just walking and talking and not even paying attention to where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7445.194s">So</a> I have to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7446.995s">The</a> one about using it in the hallways during passing time, I have a problem with.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7950.123s">I</a> just want to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7951.324s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7952.686s">The</a> clarification on this was that it wasn't that I don't know that things are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7957.57s">You</a> know me well enough that I've advocated a lot sitting at the meetings that we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7963.016s">My</a> concern is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7964.637s">If</a> we're going to allow our students to use the phones in between classes, and if it's because of scheduling or looking at schedule because it's easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7973.702s">We</a> all know our kids right now, they come out of the womb with the cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7976.964s">We</a> know that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7978.245s">And</a> I'm not foolish enough to say that every child in the school does not use their phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7982.607s">I</a> know that, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7984.108s">What</a> I'm concerned with is when you're saying using the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7988.77s">Are</a> you saying that you're going to be using the phone and allowing them to take it out so they can know what class they're going to? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7993.752s">Some</a> kids might even put a diagram so they know exactly where the classes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7997.333s">That's</a> easier for them than the map we provide in the back of our handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8003.815s">My</a> concern is students walking around while they're trying to get their things out of the locker, and they're all walking around with their cell phones.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8065.217s">I</a> think that has to be clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8066.878s">Because</a> when I said safety, that's what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8069.179s">When</a> you're on a crowded staircase, and you're going down the stairs, and you're holding books or whatever, and you're making a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8075.381s">Because</a> this does not say they may be used in a hallway during passing time only. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8080.924s">Excluding</a> phone calls.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8943.524s">Because</a> I don't know what was, I don't have it in front of me to compare what was on it before and what isn't on it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8949.726s">Now,</a> I like the idea because we have discussed, we have to make sure that everybody is on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8955.807s">And</a> I think it's important, especially when the kids are going from the middle school to the high school and to the elementary schools to the middle schools that everybody knows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8963.989s">I</a> guess my thing, I was reading a few of these things and like anything else, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8969.831s">I</a> know teachers have a lot to do and it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8973.014s">And</a> I know administrators have the same type of responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8976.478s">The</a> only thing I guess for me is that if we're implementing this, if we're putting it out there, we have to make sure that we abide by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8985.066s">So</a> if we're putting it out there, that means everyone is going to abide by it and it's not going to be like, gee, I could go through this hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8991.873s">And</a> so and so doesn't see me, and I could go through the other hallway where I know someone's going to see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8996.115s">So</a> I just want to make sure that everyone's on board with this as far as, it says here, I don't mean to pick on the high school, but I know it has been done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9005.059s">That</a> if a student will be provided a school issued suitable item of clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9011.222s">So</a> I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9015.224s">And</a> if we're looking at our students, we as adults have to be their examples too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9020.986s">So</a> I'm just putting it out there that everybody should be very well-weared. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9026.989s">If</a> we're asking our students to wear certain clothing, then we ourselves should be wearing the same and not wearing one thing or saying one thing and showing the students something different.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11016.004s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11019.385s">I</a> just don't actually went upon that one, but I'm concerned about the GPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11024.45s">And</a> as my colleagues just mentioned it, I think that the GPA part of this really needs to be, we need to sit down, clarify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11034.08s">This</a> is a huge impact on parents and students on both ends, whether your GPA is high or low or in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11043.169s">We</a> really need to clarify it because, I mean, I was reading this and I totally understand on certain things, but I don't want to go from one extreme to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11052.612s">And</a> we're saying that we're not going to maybe do the GPA the way it is, but it's important for parents to understand, is this something that's going to impair our students that are going to go on to higher education? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11066.969s">I</a> don't want parents thinking that if we're going to change our system, it's going to impair their children when they go off to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11076.031s">If</a> we're all on the same page, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11078.413s">But</a> I just don't want to turn around now and hear, OK, we're going to be doing it in one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11082.817s">And</a> then they go to apply in a totally different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11086.019s">I</a> mean, with all due respect and everything, I'm looking at this, and it says, you know, problems with the GPA are concerns of high-achieving students and their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11095.287s">Time</a> spent resolving them is time spent not helping the school's lower-achieving students who already don't value GPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11105.723s">I</a> don't want that message to go out thinking that we're only going to be now concentrating on one group rather than concentrating on all the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11114.627s">And</a> it's just as important it is to make sure that our educational gap gets closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11119.569s">I</a> want to make sure that we put out the correct information and that we're doing the correct thing of making it closer, not just changing the GPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11129.533s">I</a> know the next thing that's going to come out of this, if people start reading it, and students start reading it, we're going to be almost in the same situation of what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11137.578s">Kreatz</a> said at the beginning of this meeting, and that is, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11142.181s">Are</a> we going to start taking away valedictorians? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11144.162s">Are</a> we going to start taking away certain things? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11146.403s">And</a> if that's the case, and if that is a culture that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11150.165s">this</a> school and this district is going to do, it has to be very important that we clarify it and we disclose it and we are transparent about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11159.65s">Because</a> I don't want to get a phone call in May saying, guess what, in June we're not going to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11165.213s">If</a> that's something that's going to be discussed across this district, and more importantly with the students in this school, I want to make sure that they are very much aware of where we're going to go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11175.058s">And</a> I think as a school committee, we definitely want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11178.76s">how</a> we're going to achieve this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11193.586s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11200.329s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11201.169s">And</a> definitely have it open. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11203.85s">Are</a> you going to also have a discussion with parents once this is done?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11244.817s">Well,</a> and that's exactly what I'm saying, that if parents start reading this, they're going to jump to conclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11251.881s">And</a> I don't want parents to have the fear out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11254.762s">And</a> I don't want the students to have the fear out there, no matter which group or subgroup they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11259.785s">And</a> that's why I said it's very important that we do discuss this the proper way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11263.767s">And</a> not starting rumors out there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11458.429s">Can</a> I just ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11460.07s">I</a> know that the city council meetings, the last few of them, have been done in the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11465.272s">And</a> the reason that I know that there's been discussion of having it here is because the issues that they've brought at the meeting has brought in a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11473.996s">So</a> it's been difficult to have it over there because it's packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11477.478s">We're</a> at a situation where we're not like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11479.539s">Is</a> it possible maybe for us to go back in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11481.46s">Because</a> it's a lot more intimate than this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11487.748s">All</a> righty, new business.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11585.576s">Just</a> before, I just want to say, I just want to congratulate the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11590.959s">Well,</a> first of all, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Nicole Kieser and her family for her new baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11597.143s">And</a> also for the Nelson and Kieser families, congratulations on them for their grandchild. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11602.247s">So</a> that was a nice thing.<h2><a href="../2017-08-15_7sg70fldaE8/2017-08-15_7sg70fldaE8.html">Medford, MA City Council - Aug. 15, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8567.998s">And</a> again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8578.684s">We</a> were not the part of that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8581.526s">It</a> had never been discussed with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8583.347s">It</a> had only been discussed to waive the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8586.109s">So</a> as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8592.913s">and</a> on record that I was not for a primary.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9399.982s">Well,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9400.503s">Everybody</a> else is saying that they've texted and phoned everybody.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5571.376s">Okay,</a> whether they're taking it online or not.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5574.936s">The</a> other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5583.319s">Like</a> how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5589.582s">From</a> what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5677.595s">And</a> you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5684.38s">How</a> many students did we have?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5782.453s">And</a> as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5886.071s">products</a> some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too because we just don't want them sitting there obviously Right and the other my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if you know other people do have that accessibility <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5908.163s">And</a> I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're failing because now they're falling behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5913.264s">So</a> I guess my question is, too, is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5964.168s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5964.588s">And</a> you, last question was, is that you have, um, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5971.474s">Are</a> those the same courses that are going to be provided this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5973.696s">Are</a> you going to add more?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5029.373s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5030.113s">The</a> other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5038.518s">Like</a> how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5044.782s">From</a> what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5132.754s">And</a> you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5139.557s">How</a> many students did we have?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5237.407s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5238.227s">And</a> as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5349.778s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5350.158s">And</a> the other, my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if, you know, other people do have that accessibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5363.357s">And</a> I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5368.46s">So</a> I guess my question is too is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5419.379s">Okay,</a> and you, and one last question was that you have, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5426.664s">Are</a> those the same courses that are going to be provided this year or are you going to add more?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5437.452s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5642.67s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6254.835s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6254.935s">I</a> just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6260.062s">Not</a> yet.<h2><a href="../2017-05-09_2Xo4xfl-Zsw/2017-05-09_2Xo4xfl-Zsw.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 1, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1351.165s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1353.446s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1353.666s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1354.467s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1355.067s">Thank</a> you again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1355.787s">Jensen,</a> for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1357.308s">Again,</a> extremely proud of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1362.003s">And</a> I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1369.437s">And</a> maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1375.005s">that</a> received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1378.248s">And</a> the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1396.904s">I</a> heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Medford students are all going to this school or that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1402.77s">And</a> I'm not saying that one school is better than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1405.252s">But</a> they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1410.657s">And</a> when we approached it, we said, it's not fair to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1415.715s">Because</a> parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1425.742s">So</a> I think it's very important for the school, but also for the students, to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2165.742s">I</a> just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2174.346s">I</a> know that you have collaborated with different organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2178.028s">I'm</a> just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2191.093s">And</a> I was just curious if <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2192.534s">If</a> it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2222.387s">This</a> wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city, I know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out maybe, when they do have their meetings, of giving them the information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or you know, when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2252.242s">Just</a> to get the word out again.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2271.475s">This</a> week it's going to be tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2273.336s">Senior</a> center at 6, Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2274.917s">Wednesday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2275.317s">Today's</a> Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2276.038s">Sorry.</a>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2860.442s">So</a> when would the deadline be after this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2863.623s">Like</a> if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through, this is us just basically saying that we are interested in this, this is what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2872.926s">When</a> is the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2873.866s">Because</a> I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2879.465s">and</a> take the vote the proper way, and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2886.348s">But</a> if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2888.629s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2889.149s">So</a> I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not that we're doing it, I'm just saying I don't want to hear another fiasco.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2944.847s">Which</a> is fine, and I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2946.589s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out how much time that we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to... Well, we're going to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2970.478s">Because</a> if I'm not mistaken it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because it has nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2975.741s">I</a> apologize for that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3709.381s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3709.562s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3710.402s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3710.782s">Just</a> for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, are you talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3725.989s">Okay,</a> that's the door I want, okay.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3728.411s">And</a> so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3754.02s">when</a> you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded, and I was just curious in knowing when you wrote the report, did you have like the wish list from the schools?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3811.556s">Well,</a> I mean, over the years, it's basically been two, just to make sure the bathrooms are back up to date, because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3821.62s">The</a> playgrounds, I know that's something that we've all looked at.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3841.531s">And</a> it's just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3899.693s">And</a> what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3906.446s">They've</a> been better than the ones that we still have.<h2><a href="../2017-05-02_sDVXXKyS5x4/2017-05-02_sDVXXKyS5x4.html">Medford, MA School Committe - May 1, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2107.501s">So</a> when would the deadline be after this? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2110.683s">Like</a> if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2114.626s">This</a> is us just basically saying that we are interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2118.669s">This</a> is what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2119.99s">When</a> is the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2120.911s">Because</a> I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2126.523s">and</a> take the vote the proper way and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2133.408s">But</a> if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2136.229s">So</a> I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not, not that we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2140.552s">I'm</a> just saying, I don't want to hear another fiasco.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2191.905s">Which</a> is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2192.486s">And</a> I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2193.647s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out how much time though we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2217.813s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2218.053s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because there's nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2222.796s">I</a> apologize for that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2411.513s">happen</a> that day, but it could be a possibility.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.48s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.861s">Just</a> for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, you're talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2964.129s">Yes,</a> the pool entrance.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2972.399s">That's</a> the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.059s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.279s">That's,</a> that's the door I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2974.72s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2975.46s">And</a> so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.405s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.745s">And</a> the other thing I want to ask is, when you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3016.599s">And</a> I was just curious in knowing, when you wrote the report, did you have the wish list from the schools?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3058.627s">Well,</a> I mean, over the years, it's basically been two just to make sure like, you know, the bathrooms are back up to date because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3070.293s">I</a> know that's something that we've all looked at.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3088.602s">And</a> just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3146.737s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3147.618s">And</a> what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3154.24s">They're</a> the ones that we still have?<h2><a href="../2017-04-05_GnKIPou12eI/2017-04-05_GnKIPou12eI.html">Medford School Committee April 3, 2017 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=749.875s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=750.075s">Conyo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=750.896s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=752.857s">The</a> total screenings that came out was a total of 39. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=757.14s">Seven</a> students came forward for you to know who they were, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=760.582s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=762.103s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=762.443s">Then</a> the 32, what do we do with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=764.345s">If</a> they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=790.377s">Right,</a> so what do we do to keep on reinforcing what we reinforce?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=810.38s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=810.66s">And</a> it's a very delicate line. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=812.601s">I</a> mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=814.982s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=815.402s">But</a> we're also trying to get the trust of the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=817.603s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=818.303s">And</a> if you have the seven that have come forward, what we're hoping to do is have the loyalty and the confidentiality. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=828.248s">So</a> maybe those seven could hopefully give us, maybe, or have the other students <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=833.756s">say,</a> you know, listen, it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=836.097s">No</a> one is really saying anything about us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=837.858s">We're</a> going to counseling and we're helping. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=840.3s">You</a> know, if you want to go, the door is open.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=876.02s">And</a> the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=906.635s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=908.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=908.375s">And</a> thank you for all the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=909.395s">I</a> mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together is a lot of work.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1711.941s">Um,</a> actually to Sarah, um, the question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks school for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1719.802s">Um,</a> that's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1721.302s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1721.842s">That's</a> what you really should be proud of yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1723.683s">That's</a> a wonderful thing to achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1725.83s">My</a> question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1732.496s">And</a> since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years, do you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1786.612s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1786.972s">No,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1788.732s">That</a> way, too, they have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1791.333s">As</a> my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1798.015s">So</a> at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you and to try to find out what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1807.199s">I</a> think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2138.833s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2140.395s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2141.215s">Um,</a> Mr. Edwards, how many students have you had in the past go?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2155.589s">So</a> last year you had less than 49 students go?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2162.974s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2165.656s">Because</a> I know over the years that we've tried to say, I know over the years it's been together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2173.061s">And</a> we kind of thought that was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2175.183s">So</a> that way the students felt that <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2176.963s">It</a> was like one field trip for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2181.908s">Do</a> we have any students that want to do like a one-nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn School?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2202.49s">And</a> it wouldn't be right for the student either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2203.851s">I'm</a> just asking if anybody's asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2205.991s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2207.371s">And</a> Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2210.852s">What</a> time do you get back?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2217.854s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2217.994s">So</a> you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2226.955s">In</a> place of the Bronx too, I guess.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2231.615s">All</a> right, I was just curious.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2248.202s">We</a> don't have your itinerary. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2251.463s">So</a> if you could provide that for us with the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2255.765s">And</a> do you also have the same amount of chaperones?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2264.075s">And</a> 49 students? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2265.255s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2266.976s">And</a> I was just reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2269.316s">And</a> yourself?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2271.957s">OK,</a> so it's just the six chaperones and the students?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2279.919s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2281.22s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2281.44s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3232.832s">First</a> of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3240.914s">Is</a> it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3308.14s">Well,</a> how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3390.506s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3390.706s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3391.426s">I</a> also have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3392.727s">Tony,</a> you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3404.771s">Do</a> we have to find out like where we have our proms? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3407.852s">Do</a> we have to find out if those locations, if there's anything going on, because we do have <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3412.108s">The</a> proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site are banquets for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3417.61s">When</a> we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season, do we need to find out if those places are off?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3464.125s">I</a> would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3473.051s">I</a> think it'd just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3693.065s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3693.745s">I</a> was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3703.9s">like</a> maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts, to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong is buying some, just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3717.863s">If</a> it's five to 10, it might cost something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3720.964s">So,</a> I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3756.245s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5307.963s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5308.143s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5310.043s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Keller, for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5313.304s">As</a> far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5370.542s">Because</a> you have replaced lost or damaged books, because the cost of replacing newer books is very high. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5376.702s">So</a> how about the new books that were bought at the high school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5380.465s">Those</a> are the ones I'm talking about.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5384.529s">So</a> has the number of losing books increased?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=720.715s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=720.915s">Cono.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=721.736s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=722.157s">Um,</a> the total screenings that that came out was a total of 39, seven students came forward for you to know who they were, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=731.589s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=732.71s">Then</a> the 32, what do we do with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=735.194s">If</a> they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=761.217s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=761.658s">So</a> what do we do?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=781.235s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=781.495s">And</a> it's a very delicate line. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=783.436s">I</a> mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know, but we're also trying to get the trust of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=789.14s">And</a> if you have the seven that have come forward, what you want, what we're hoping to do is have that, the loyalty and the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=798.185s">confidentiality</a> so maybe those seven could hopefully give us maybe or have the other students say you know listen it's working no one is really saying anything about us we're going to counseling and we're helping you know if you want to go the door is open
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=846.873s">And</a> the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=877.472s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=878.852s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=879.212s">And</a> thank you for all the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=880.232s">I</a> mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=883.574s">It's</a> a lot of work.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1683.039s">Actually,</a> to Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1684.919s">The</a> question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks School for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1691.041s">That's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1692.141s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1692.981s">You</a> really should be proud of yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1694.522s">That's</a> a wonderful thing to achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1696.682s">My</a> question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1703.344s">And</a> since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1709.225s">Do</a> you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1757.45s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1757.81s">No,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1759.572s">That</a> way, too, they have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1762.174s">As</a> my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody, so at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1774.714s">and</a> to try to find out what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1778.036s">I</a> think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2109.694s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2109.894s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2111.235s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2113.856s">Mr.</a> Edwards, how many students have you had in the Pasco?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2126.436s">So</a> last year you had less than 49 students go?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2133.843s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2136.485s">Because</a> I know over the years that we've tried to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2141.413s">I</a> know over the years it's been together and I kind of thought that was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2145.996s">So</a> that way the students felt that it was like one field trip for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2150.918s">Um,</a> do we have any students that want to do like a one nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2173.333s">And</a> it wouldn't be right for the student either. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2174.694s">I'm</a> just asking if anybody's asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2176.814s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2178.194s">And</a> Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2181.695s">What</a> time do you get back?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2188.676s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2188.836s">So</a> you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2193.737s">The</a> Bronx. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2194.877s">No,</a> they added a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2196.077s">You</a> added the show? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2197.217s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2197.798s">In</a> place of the Bronx too, I guess.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2216.268s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2219.05s">We</a> don't have your itinerary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2222.313s">So</a> if you could provide that for us with the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2226.616s">And</a> do you also have the same amount of chaperones?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2234.915s">And</a> 49 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2237.796s">And</a> I was just reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2240.156s">And</a> yourself?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2242.797s">OK,</a> so it's just the six chaperones and the students.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2250.739s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2252.06s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3203.678s">First</a> of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3211.763s">Is</a> it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3279.0s">Well,</a> how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3285.277s">I</a> didn't bring that with me.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3361.347s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3361.548s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3362.288s">I</a> also have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3363.568s">Tony,</a> you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3375.625s">Do</a> we have to find out where we have our proms? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3378.686s">Do</a> we have to find out at those locations if there's anything going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3381.867s">Because</a> we do have proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3387.089s">Our</a> banquets for our students, when we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3392.128s">do</a> we need to find out those?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3434.976s">I</a> would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3443.905s">I</a> think it would just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3663.178s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3663.919s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3664.359s">I</a> was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if like maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3684.132s">is</a> buying some just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3688.717s">If</a> it's five to 10, it might cost something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3691.8s">So,</a> I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5278.812s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5278.992s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5280.893s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Keller, for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5284.155s">As</a> far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5341.384s">Because</a> you have replaced lost or damaged books because the cost of replacing newer books is very high. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5347.547s">So</a> how about the new books that were bought at the high school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5351.329s">Those</a> are the ones I'm talking about.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5355.371s">So</a> has the number of losing books increased?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1340.641s">Okay,</a> and so when you answer these questions, like, is it, I mean, is it like in an essay form? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1345.345s">I</a> mean, how long do they give you to answer the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1351.87s">You've</a> won it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1352.451s">You</a> might as well explain it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1387.218s">And</a> how long do the rounds usually last? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1392.659s">45</a> minutes a round? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1394.28s">And</a> how many rounds do you do?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1399.781s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1401.481s">That's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1402.702s">And</a> just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1405.462s">I</a> know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1410.163s">For</a> person or overall?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1466.488s">Very</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1467.128s">Very</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1467.629s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1477.787s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1482.449s">I</a> just want to say some food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1485.15s">This</a> particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1493.874s">It</a> seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1498.596s">As</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1499.096s">Van</a> der Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1504.038s">I</a> think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1517.67s">And</a> we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1524.035s">So</a> just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3841.504s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.785s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.965s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3843.906s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3844.966s">And</a> thank you Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3846.027s">Jensen</a> for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3847.828s">It</a> is very particular and a lot of details. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3852.752s">I'm</a> looking at the Coffee with the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3855.113s">How</a> did you promote that? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3856.554s">Was</a> it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3861.697s">What</a> time was it scheduled and is it individual?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3920.028s">That</a> sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3922.21s">The</a> other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75% of at-risk seniors, which means it's 2.5 GPA or lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3931.916s">So</a> I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3938.881s">But</a> I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3977.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3978.707s">And</a> I see that you've had the second C3 day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.389s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.869s">And</a> how did that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3982.71s">Did</a> you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4017.332s">I</a> know that my colleague asked, the councillors at the high school have about 300 students a piece, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4022.734s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4023.874s">And</a> we are still doing it that it's not, we're doing it in alphabetical order so that way not everyone has, there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4034.918s">Okay,</a> and so with that being said, how many seniors does each councillor have, do you know?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4046.6s">60</a> to 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4049.123s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.582s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.762s">Cuno,</a> follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4165.264s">Yes,</a> please, a follow-up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4166.825s">So</a> if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4174.391s">Are</a> they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4210.639s">How</a> many electives do we have in all?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4215.323s">And</a> how many are we going to limit to the freshmen? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4218.065s">Is</a> it 20?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4228.14s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4450.715s">How</a> does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4464.767s">So</a> how do you work that into the CTE?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4469.991s">So</a> you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.054s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.855s">But</a> we're also giving them the opportunity to go over <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4477.464s">to</a> the technical side and maybe explore over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4480.827s">So</a> is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4518.621s">All</a> right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4525.084s">I</a> didn't think we were going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4527.865s">So</a> this is now at least a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4530.786s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4533.127s">I</a> won't do any more follow-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4534.187s">Thank</a> you very much, Ms.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4538.049s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5894.526s">with</a> the signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5895.306s">I</a> just want to make sure that where it says here, like this is for grade five, but I'm assuming this is for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5902.171s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5903.472s">Um,</a> also to send it home. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5905.613s">So</a> a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are, once you're approving it, we won't
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.482s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.802s">But</a> I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5916.783s">And</a> I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5921.725s">So</a> that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5925.566s">I</a> didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5928.627s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6319.791s">Okay,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6320.332s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6321.433s">Well,</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6322.734s">One,</a> are we utilizing the city calendar because this is a situation where, I don't know if you're aware of it, but on Thursday, April 6th, from 7 to 8, the Medford High School is having a science lecture, and then on the same night, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6338.642s">We're</a> having a method high school's, oh I'm sorry, it was a math. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6342.425s">One</a> says math, one says science. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6343.827s">I</a> thought it was two separate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6345.028s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6346.509s">So</a> I guess that's all one. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6347.87s">We</a> have two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6349.391s">And</a> then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6356.357s">and</a> to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6359.561s">It</a> was just a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6361.504s">This</a> was a program that I was approached on. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6364.667s">The</a> Italian Consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6373.349s">not</a> only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6381.858s">And</a> so he wanted to showcase different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6384.501s">We</a> were fortunate enough, there were 14 schools that they showcased. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6387.985s">We</a> were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6391.368s">which</a> I believe was very beneficial for us because we really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6401.332s">The</a> students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6407.455s">It</a> wasn't just open to one side or another side. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6409.976s">All</a> students had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6411.893s">We</a> were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6429.217s">So</a> there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6433.418s">The</a> staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6439.604s">And</a> because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6452.274s">which</a> made me really happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6453.435s">And</a> I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it, to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6463.421s">Nelson</a> and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6464.021s">Caldwell,</a> and of course, our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6466.182s">It</a> was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6474.547s">And</a> it was a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6475.508s">It</a> was a very good day.<h2><a href="../2017-04-04_WSQLRgnxB8U/2017-04-04_WSQLRgnxB8U.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Mar. 6, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1274.165s">And</a> how long does it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1275.247s">Do</a> the rounds usually last? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1279.59s">45</a> minutes a round? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1281.212s">And</a> how many rounds do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1285.395s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1286.716s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1288.417s">That's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1289.638s">And</a> just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1292.401s">I</a> know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1297.09s">For</a> person or overall?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3863.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3865.681s">And</a> I see that you've had the second C3 day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3868.342s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3868.822s">And</a> how did that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3869.663s">Did</a> you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3904.288s">I</a> know that my colleague asked the Councilors at the high school have about 300 students apiece correct correct and We are still doing it that it's not we're doing it with alphabet in alphabetical order So that way not everyone has there's no there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors, correct Okay, and so with that being said how many seniors does each Councilor have do you know?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3933.574s">60</a> to 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3936.076s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4050.535s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4050.715s">Cuno,</a> follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4051.896s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4052.756s">A</a> follow-up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4053.776s">So</a> if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4061.338s">Are</a> they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4097.596s">How</a> many electives do we have in all?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4102.28s">And</a> how many are we going to limit to the freshmen? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4105.023s">Is</a> it 20?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4115.099s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4116.3s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4337.572s">How</a> does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore? <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4351.715s">So</a> how do you work that into the CTE?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4357.035s">So</a> you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4360.996s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4361.796s">But</a> we're also giving them the opportunity to go over to the technical side and maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4366.483s">explore</a> over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4367.784s">So</a> is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4405.558s">All</a> right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4412.039s">I</a> didn't think we were going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4414.82s">So</a> this is now at least a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4417.74s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4420.081s">I</a> won't do any more follow-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4421.021s">Thank</a> you very much, Ms.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4425.002s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5184.224s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5185.024s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Benetton. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5187.125s">Well,</a> one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5196.889s">And</a> I know that she knows what she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5200.871s">I</a> know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at some, you know, another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5211.315s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5211.935s">but</a> I know that part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5213.476s">I</a> guess the curiosity of that is, like, we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this learn it the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5225.062s">So</a> is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5297.35s">That's</a> good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5778.077s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5781.801s">I</a> just want to make sure that where it says here like this is for grade 5, but I'm assuming this is for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5789.13s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5791.033s">Also</a> to send it home so a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5800.296s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5800.776s">But</a> I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5803.758s">And</a> I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5808.7s">So</a> that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5812.522s">I</a> didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5815.584s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6207.368s">Are</a> we utilizing the the city calendar because this is a situation where I'm aware of it But on Thursday April 6 from 7 to 8 the method high school is having a science lecture and then on the same night <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6225.593s">We're</a> having a method high school, oh I'm sorry, it was a math. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6229.395s">One</a> says math, one says science. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6230.796s">I</a> thought it was two separate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6231.976s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6233.477s">So</a> I guess that's all one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6234.818s">We</a> have two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6236.339s">And</a> then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6243.322s">and</a> to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6246.524s">It</a> was just a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6248.465s">This</a> was a program that I was approached on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6251.627s">They</a> are trying, the Italian consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6260.32s">not</a> only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6268.803s">And</a> so he wanted to showcase different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6271.464s">We</a> were fortunate enough, there was 14 schools that they showcased. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6274.945s">We</a> were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first, which I believe was very beneficial for us because <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6282.339s">We</a> really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6288.324s">The</a> students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6294.429s">It</a> wasn't just open to one side or another side. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6296.951s">All</a> students had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6298.864s">We</a> were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6316.193s">So</a> there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6320.389s">The</a> staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6326.573s">And</a> because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering, which made me really happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6340.423s">And</a> I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6349.917s">to</a> Miss Nelson, Miss Caldwell, and of course, our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6353.338s">It</a> was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and, you know, walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6361.5s">And</a> it was a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6362.48s">It</a> was a very good day.<h2><a href="../2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA/2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 23, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=23.584s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=24.124s">Because</a> I know that when the BN director was here last week or two weeks ago, uh, she was saying that the rules have changed and it's very delicate because if it's the teacher who's giving out, let's say the medication, even though, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=39.578s">In</a> this, it says that it's almost approved that a teacher could give out the medication.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=107.183s">And</a> I guess the other concern for me would be is that I know that one of the options you had stated was that you could have a nurse contracted from where you're going.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=116.497s">But</a> the thing is if you're talking about let's say we've had students that have gone across to Europe and they're taking different flights, it doesn't mean necessarily that the nurse will be with them from when they leave here until they get to where their destination is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=131.29s">So</a> that's something I think that we also need to take in consideration and make sure that we do have coverage when we're thinking about this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=153.074s">So</a> then could I just ask, I know that you are still in the middle of trying to get all the information for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=159.437s">If</a> we could find out from other districts how they're doing it, because I mean, they're sending their students away, not away, but they're going on their trips.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=180.962s">And</a> this is something that's changing now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=183.123s">We</a> didn't have this implemented years ago or even up until last year.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=207.489s">And</a> I guess my last question is that if there is a child who does need special services, let's say the parent turns around and says that they want to be the chaperone.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=219.892s">And</a> then we wouldn't have to worry about the nurse? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=221.633s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.208s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.368s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=617.369s">Just</a> for a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=618.43s">I</a> agree with, you know, making sure that we have the protocol, but my concern is that as we're speaking tonight, it doesn't seem like anything is really concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=626.437s">So</a> I don't want to just rush into this and put something on our website or have parents know about it if we're not a hundred percent sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=633.103s">The</a> motion was for the superintendent to draft a policy that we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.606s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.847s">So</a> that was my clarification there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=638.328s">And</a> as far as I think for us to discuss tonight, how to figure this out, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=643.172s">is</a> really, there's a lot going on because there are a lot of trips that go on and first of all, whoever is planning it at that moment in time does not have to go out and advertise that there's gonna be a child who's going to be a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=657.616s">It's</a> just like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=658.896s">I</a> mean, if there's a particular trip that this particular trip is now going to have three meals included, it's not dissected because this person here needs a little bit extra, this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=670.199s">I</a> think it's really up <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=672.323s">to</a> the group that's planning it, they don't have to go out and advertise and say, well, gee, we're going to be paying $2,000 more because we need a nurse for X child because it's not fair.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=715.159s">No,</a> and I just want to finish it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=717.581s">But</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=718.262s">I</a> think it's a little bit more involved than just us sitting here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=722.085s">So</a> I definitely agree with the superintendent doing that and making sure that we look at it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2276.868s">Can</a> you speak up a little bit more? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2279.11s">Okay,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2280.471s">I'll</a> take care of it.<h2><a href="../2017-01-11_TQ69v4m8ftY/2017-01-11_TQ69v4m8ftY.html">Medford School Committee meeting January 9, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=22.759s">I</a> pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=27.027s">and</a> to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.607s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.827s">Cuno,</a> point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=161.508s">The</a> reason that you haven't seen in the last few years is because actually Paulette and I had been paid for, our expenses were paid for MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=170.715s">Paulette</a> and I are no longer on MASC as far as executive board is concerned, so that's why the reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=177.52s">And</a> you haven't seen it over the last few years, that's the reason.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=481.903s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=482.103s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=483.123s">Well,</a> I want to congratulate you guys for doing, finally getting to this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=488.244s">This</a> is a big step for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=489.385s">It's</a> a huge step. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=491.965s">It's</a> a huge step.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=495.546s">We</a> can still step bigger, but we're getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=498.846s">It's</a> in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=501.407s">Could</a> you tell me how many other schools or districts are participating in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=505.108s">This</a> across, because this is a,
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.054s">That</a> sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.774s">How</a> many chaperones are we looking at?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=580.038s">And</a> are the chaperones paying the same amount?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=618.553s">Okay,</a> and I know that it says that it has the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=623.647s">So</a> is the insurance, I mean the details of the insurance, have they been over, like have you sat down or will you sit down with the parents and the students to make sure the details of the insurance itself because in the past we've had a couple of issues that parents thought it covered one thing and then it didn't cover another thing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=652.082s">That</a> will all be explained to our kickoff meeting which is March 15th with the travel agency that we're using That will be they'll have a whole sign off on that the parent and student also have to sign off on it with this part of their contract Okay to commit to the trip, and I'm looking at it, and I'm just going over It says here that this includes the cost of providing a nurse, and I'm just curious maybe through the mayor to the superintendent I don't remember seeing this in other trips and
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=694.355s">What</a> happens if we don't use that money?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=699.59s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=700.11s">And</a> are the students paying for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=703.711s">Is</a> it going to be out of their own pocket? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=704.911s">Is</a> there fundraising involved with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=706.532s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=727.6s">Sounds</a> good, and the only other question I have is, Mr. Seary might have the answer to this one, or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=733.903s">Joy,</a> which is, our last year at this time, we actually had the science department take the students to Disney at this time, and I'm not sure if that's happening again this year.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=775.741s">I</a> was thinking it was in April, but you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=777.803s">It</a> was in February last year.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=780.025s">All</a> right, but it would have been nice.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=784.75s">I've</a> been involved with that baggage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=786.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=788.253s">Thank</a> you very much, and congratulations to all, and we're looking forward to hearing back.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.505s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.685s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1188.345s">So</a> I guess through you to the superintendent, I also need a little bit more of clarification as we've been speaking about the $1,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1195.834s">The</a> $1,700 is money that the group, whoever's going, is going to raise to cover the $1,700?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.187s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.707s">So</a> I guess I have a couple of questions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1288.855s">It's</a> going to be incorporated into the students.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.461s">But</a> now here's the other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1296.382s">Who</a> pays for that person to go to Florida or Italy or wherever? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1301.147s">So</a> is that their trip is also incorporated into the students fees?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1317.07s">Okay,</a> so that's incorporated Yes, so that $1,700 isn't just is inclusive separate plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1322.053s">No,</a> that's the entire trip.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1339.707s">Okay,</a> but this is separate, so forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1341.568s">Okay,</a> forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.809s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.989s">Kreatz.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.099s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.299s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1597.16s">First</a> of all, I have you both here, so I want to say congratulations for all the work that you, your staff, and everybody involved in this has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1604.485s">It's</a> been an incredible four years as a school committee member and as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1609.028s">I'm</a> really happy and thrilled to see the collaboration between the two and to see that divided <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1616.187s">the</a> division between the two is finally diminishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1619.989s">As</a> the superintendent said, I think this is a wonderful idea, but there were concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1625.611s">I</a> had called him today because there's just so much to go over that we really can't do it in such a very short time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1633.114s">So</a> I am thrilled that we are, you know, we have decided, or I'm hoping that we decide to do this as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1639.737s">So</a> that way we could have more presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1642.501s">and</a> that way we could sit down and actually go through the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1645.122s">I</a> don't want to put hysteria out there saying that one school is taking over the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1650.383s">I</a> want to make sure that people understand that this has been a work in progress, that the people involved are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1656.865s">It's</a> not something that the school committee or their superintendent has thrown at you or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1662.127s">And</a> I also want to give the opportunity for people in our city to come and voice their opinion if they have concerns or whatever the situation may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1671.149s">So</a> with that being said, I, again, congratulate all of you, including the students, because I've seen the atmosphere change and it's nice to see.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1685.097s">Yes,</a> please.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2118.838s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2119.879s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2120.079s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2121.06s">Yes,</a> I just want to go back and I totally agree with what my colleagues have said and both of you actually, all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2129.171s">I</a> think it's important that we do have this committee of the whole, but also <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2134.457s">let</a> it be understood that this has been a, you know, work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2138.04s">This</a> isn't something, and I have no intentions, and I'm sure we all have the same one, which is I'm not expecting to go into a committee of the whole for a couple of hours and have all the answers and shut the book and say, okay, guess what, this is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2151.349s">What</a> I really would like to see is I would like to see as we post the meeting to make sure that we invite alumni, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2157.273s">that</a> we make sure that we, you know, invite not only our alumni as students, but our alumni who are now our businesses, because I know that there's a lot of collaboration between the high school, the vocational school, and our businesses right now, but really the input of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2173.082s">And</a> we have to understand, as I've mentioned before, and the fact is that having the opportunity of being on MASC, I've also seen the opportunity of <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2183.328s">how</a> vocational schools have been changing throughout not only the state of Massachusetts, but throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2189.091s">And</a> we have always had a strong vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2192.212s">And</a> no one is saying that what we've done in the past wasn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2197.735s">We're</a> just saying, let's go forward because we all have to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2201.917s">And</a> change, as my colleagues have said, is a very delicate situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2205.807s">And</a> I've had these conversations with alumni and strong people that have been affiliated with the vocational school in the past and said, what do you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2217.034s">You're</a> getting rid of a vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2219.456s">This</a> is not getting rid of one or eliminating the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2223.178s">This</a> is a collaboration, a collaboration that we've been working on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2227.401s">And</a> as a school committee, we've been working on it even longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2231.383s">So,</a> again, the word out there, you know, the rumors are going to start, the gossiping is going to start, but I want to make sure that people understand the integrity of what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2240.586s">And</a> the integrity of what we're doing is to give the opportunity for our students to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2246.388s">Whether</a> they're in the high school side or the vocational side, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2250.25s">We</a> want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2251.45s">that</a> these kids leave our school with the ability of doing both. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2255.633s">And</a> also making sure that our students are proud when they leave, no matter which side they're leaving from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2261.837s">One</a> is not a failure of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2263.839s">Many,</a> many years ago, it was like, oh, you go to here if you can't be book smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2268.022s">That</a> doesn't exist anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2269.763s">Book</a> smart is across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2271.464s">It's</a> for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2272.985s">And</a> I tell students, you know, I tell <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2276.007s">people</a> that have known what our vocational school was many years ago, that, well, why aren't our kids doing this anymore when they come out of the vocational? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2283.731s">And</a> I said, they don't have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2285.792s">Because</a> before, you had the choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2288.273s">You</a> could do the academic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2290.114s">You</a> did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2291.055s">But</a> it wasn't as strong or mandated by the state as we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2295.397s">And</a> so our students don't have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2297.658s">So</a> I just want to, that's a really big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2300.579s">for</a> me, because we all hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2302.68s">And</a> I just don't want those rumors to squash the good work that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2307.222s">It's</a> a work in progress, and it's going to take more than just one Committee of the Whole.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2539.6s">That's</a> awesome.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2731.542s">Motion</a> to accept the report.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2735.124s">Just</a> to say, yeah, I mean, this is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2738.086s">This</a> is really amazing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2886.094s">I</a> just want to say, if possible, to both of you, if possible, like when the students are doing, I mean, I know you can't do it all the time, but is it possible to have certain things like videotaped that we could actually put it into a video and show it off and maybe even bring it to one of our meetings and see what's really going on on an everyday basis without <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2911.395s">I</a> know the school is open for all of us to visit, and I know that we're all welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2916.119s">And</a> even though we enjoy doing that, I think sometimes the students might think, oh, there's other people watching us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2920.842s">Whereas</a> if they're free and they don't have that type of, yes, they have to have the supervision, but not our eyes being there, that maybe it would be nice to see and have them even come in down the road after this is done and give their input.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3032.734s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3033.454s">Great</a> segue, by the way, to the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3035.315s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4074.854s">Point</a> of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4075.875s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4077.215s">For</a> members that, I know this is a, it's kind of thrown at us, and I know being a little bit newer on this process, it's harder to understand, but just to explain, I know that with the math that you just talked about, when this all came about, we were basically in the same position that we were in for the math as we are now for the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4096.768s">And</a> what happened is the department heads, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4100.811s">and</a> the teachers collaborated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4102.553s">They</a> sought out the information that they were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4105.618s">Even</a> though the curriculum didn't change until the following year, it was presented to us around budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4110.922s">it</a> was presented to us prior to budget time, so that way we could actually allocate how much money we're gonna put towards the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4118.945s">And</a> then it does take a component of everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4122.547s">So</a> as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4123.267s">Caldwell</a> said, it wasn't that we chose as a school committee which classes were gonna do certain things, that we also gave the opportunity to the teachers that work on the subject on an everyday basis, that they decided what they wanted in their classroom room, and at one point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4138.913s">they</a> thought each group was different from the group next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4142.798s">So</a> as far as I am understanding it all, it's a very similar process, even though it might not be the academic year of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4151.691s">with</a> us knowing what has been brought to us by the state and with the work that the department heads and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4157.836s">Caldwell</a> are doing, they're going out, they're seeking out the best possible programs for us, then they will be bringing it back to us and in the meantime also reviewing it with the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4170.466s">So</a> there's a lot of components to it rather than just saying this is what we're approving and that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4176.831s">So</a> if that was beneficial.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6050.072s">I</a> just want to say just to be careful and pin pigeonhole everybody only because you also have to take in consideration the ages of the students in the classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6058.979s">I</a> mean, you know, it's a little bit different from a kindergartner than it is a fifth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6063.263s">So</a> to, to say the whole school or not, the whole school is a little bit delicate.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6296.045s">I</a> just want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6296.965s">I</a> just want to congratulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6297.945s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6298.045s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6298.565s">I</a> want to congratulate Brittany Lanzilli and the Lanzilli family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6302.066s">Brittany</a> is a graduate of MHS of 2014, and she has been named to the 2017 US Women's National University team. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6313.01s">They</a> will compete in the 2017 Winter World University Games. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6317.051s">So</a> I want to congratulate Brittany and their families.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=597.072s">A</a> full refund?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=606.589s">Okay,</a> and what about if there is a situation, like unfortunately there was a situation because of... <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=611.374s">I</a> think that was the bottom line.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=654.76s">If</a> you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1261.69s">There</a> was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1267.173s">it</a> was more a group of students after they graduated high school that did go down to have a nice time before college. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1277.255s">Unfortunately,</a> there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1286.017s">And</a> there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1290.576s">Vi</a> är alltid säker på att det finns extra uppfyllelse och att det finns insuranser som är en del av det, men att vi vet att det finns en chaperone som är en del av det lokala, det är en stor del. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1305.378s">Det</a> var från den agensy som de använde, eller gruppen som de använde, som faktiskt var där nere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1311.744s">Så</a> jag tror att det är en bra del av det här.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2506.808s">Muy</a> bien. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2507.209s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2507.269s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2508.389s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2508.869s">I</a> don't really have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2510.45s">I</a> just, I guess on the record, as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2519.133s">I</a> just wanted to be on record that, again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2524.275s">They</a> just kind of always put the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2527.757s">And</a> I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2533.539s">It's</a> important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2545.144s">It's</a> not fair to our students that are graduating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2546.845s">And</a> I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about PARCC because they came and they spoke about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2553.427s">And</a> again, they had no answers to the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2558.269s">I</a> was on the board of DESC. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2561.458s">working</a> with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers so my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2676.904s">And</a> the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2685.771s">All</a> our students are going to take this exam online. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2688.774s">It's</a> going to be great for our administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2690.615s">We're</a> going to get the test scores back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2693.558s">But</a> no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2699.293s">for</a> technology is huge and it's huge across this whole state and not only the state but it's going to be across the nation and so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this because the way I feel about it I said it a few years back is that I basically feel <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2716.002s">that</a> if we don't have the proper technology, and honestly, I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this, is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best, but when you do go to a conference like that, or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear, and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board, it's something that they really need to start thinking about, because technology, I mean, look at your own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2741.095s">or</a> where you work if you're working outside of the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2744.217s">It's</a> constantly, constantly changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2746.758s">And</a> I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2750.199s">It's</a> almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2756.342s">Well,</a> that's almost like the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2758.923s">And</a> again, I will be, I will say it again that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2765.406s">We've</a> tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2773.97s">And</a> I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe, that the governor had given us was like a hundred, <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2785.127s">million</a> dollars or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2786.808s">But</a> it sounds like a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2789.01s">But</a> when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state, I mean, it ended up being what, like $10,000 or something, if that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2794.814s">So</a> again, this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3404.47s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3406.812s">Definitely</a> agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3408.233s">Thank</a> you for all the reports and everything that you brought. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3411.315s">I</a> did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3424.369s">on</a> their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3425.849s">So,</a> and again, I can't reiterate it enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3428.23s">I</a> think I sound like an old record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3430.271s">I</a> think Paulette and I both sound like old records. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3432.752s">Been</a> saying it for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3434.892s">The</a> date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3438.393s">It's</a> something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3446.216s">Yes,</a> you can get the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3448.236s">But</a> sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3453.978s">My</a> colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other and you do bond and you do, you know, over the years become friends and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way you're going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3474.427s">So</a> I will get off my soapbox, but again, look at the date for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3478.509s">It's</a> not a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3479.669s">It</a> comes every year, just like Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3481.868s">So,</a> you know, we all take our vacation time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3484.99s">Unfortunately,</a> I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3491.774s">But</a> again, it's very beneficial.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3572.624s">Point</a> of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3573.725s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3574.285s">Parents</a> have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3577.727s">They</a> finally got on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3579.087s">So</a> I know that the high school- Is that all the parents you've been on, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3582.189s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3582.849s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3583.83s">So</a> parents are definitely on.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4439.934s">Thank</a> you very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4441.195s">I</a> just threw you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4444.597s">I</a> know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4451.16s">One</a> of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4460.125s">It</a> was a one-on-one type of situation.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4463.126s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4463.607s">And</a> then last year he was talking about this year, this academic school year, that they had started another program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4470.029s">Nexus.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4470.749s">And</a> that was the one, I forgot the name of it, so I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4473.771s">But</a> I would like an update on that, if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4478.293s">We've</a> been in school for a few months, I'd like to know numbers, how's it going, what they're doing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4487.075s">–</a> Okay, after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5913.645s">Any</a> others? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5914.305s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5914.445s">Puno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5915.165s">I</a> just want to just piggyback on the letter that the superintendent put out to everyone and also to <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5925.512s">I</a> was listening to something today and it really dawned on, there's been a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5933.279s">I</a> don't want to get into politics actually, I'm actually asking people to put politics aside on Thursday and <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5942.628s">have</a> your family together, enjoy family, enjoy that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5946.772s">I've</a> heard so many crazy things from me that people are trying to avoid other people, are not inviting other people, and you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5956.58s">Political</a> life aside and everything else really take part of Thanksgiving and I'm asking everyone just to have a safe, happy Thanksgiving and just really put the political agenda aside because <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5970.239s">Nothing</a> changes the way you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5972.9s">Nothing</a> changes our ethics as people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5975.54s">Nothing</a> changes the morals that we have, the way we raise our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5981.242s">So</a> that was my thing for wishing everyone and really thinking about it.<h2><a href="../2016-11-22_sDIP3q77Fyw/2016-11-22_sDIP3q77Fyw.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Nov. 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=406.664s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=407.285s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=408.746s">The</a> trip was very successful a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=410.988s">We</a> heard a lot from the students that participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=413.731s">It</a> was really nice to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=416.333s">I</a> believe just a point of interest is that when we spoke about the trips, especially outside of the country, or even within the country, I believe we had, as a school committee, had said that one of the mandatory things was to have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=431.025s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=432.906s">I</a> guess the question is at what point, to what point do the kids get a refund if anything does happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=439.73s">Will</a> the insurance kick into that or do you work with the insurance company to do that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=472.825s">A</a> full refund?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=487.103s">of</a> safety reasons basically, that was the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=489.664s">Is</a> that something that would be covered?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=530.492s">If</a> you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=556.055s">What</a> about if we have a senior?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=606.054s">Okay,</a> well, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=606.854s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=607.915s">And</a> I was just looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=610.317s">Do</a> we have a price?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=614.821s">Did</a> I not see it?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=628.625s">Oh,</a> I apologize.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1083.5s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1083.881s">And</a> on the peace of mind, um, add the portion of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1089.708s">Is</a> there an extra coverage by any chance monetary coverage on that as far as like <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1094.381s">As</a> my colleague was saying, if God forbid, someone has to go to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1098.104s">Do</a> you know if there's extra coverage on that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1137.446s">There</a> was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group that went out for an educational piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1144.609s">It</a> was more a group of students after they graduated high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1148.53s">that</a> did go down to have a nice time before college. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1153.034s">Unfortunately,</a> there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1161.782s">And</a> there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1166.359s">We're</a> always making sure that there's extra coverage and make sure that there is the insurance that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1172.683s">But</a> knowing that there's actually a chaperone that's part of the local part of it, that's a huge part. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1177.727s">Because</a> unfortunately with that particular group, there was no one from the agency that they had used or the group that they had used. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1185.678s">that</a> was actually down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1187.519s">So</a> I think that's a great piece to this.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2382.593s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2382.793s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2384.174s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2384.654s">Um,</a> I don't really have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2386.215s">I</a> just, I guess on the record as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2394.621s">Um,</a> I just wanted to be on record that again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2400.044s">They</a> just kind of always put the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2403.547s">And</a> I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2408.23s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2409.014s">you</a> know, it's important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have, they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because you can't, it's not fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2420.924s">It's</a> not fear to our students that are graduating. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2422.625s">And</a> I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about park because they came and they spoke about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2429.21s">And</a> again, they had no answers to the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2432.993s">Um,</a> I was on the board of DSC, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2436.961s">on</a> working with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2441.425s">So</a> my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2552.674s">And</a> the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2561.561s">All</a> our students are going to take this exam online. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2564.544s">It's</a> going to be great for our administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2566.385s">We're</a> going to, you know, get the test scores back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2569.328s">But</a> no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2575.077s">for</a> technology is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2577.64s">And</a> it's huge across this whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2579.583s">And</a> not only the state, but it's going to be across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2582.686s">And</a> so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2586.371s">Because</a> the way I feel about it, I said it a few years back, is that I basically feel <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2591.797s">that</a> if we don't have the proper technology and honestly I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best but when you do go to a conference like that or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board it's something that they really need to start thinking about because technology I mean look at your own homes <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2616.882s">or</a> where you work, if you're working outside of the school system, it's constantly, constantly changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2622.526s">And</a> I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2625.989s">It's</a> almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2632.112s">Well,</a> that's almost like the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2634.694s">And</a> again, I will be, I will say it again, that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2641.18s">We've</a> tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2649.767s">And,</a> um, I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe that, um, the governor had given us was like a hundred <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2660.91s">million</a> dollars or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2662.591s">But</a> it sounds like a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2664.793s">But</a> when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state I mean it ended up being what like ten thousand dollars or something if that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2670.598s">So</a> again this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3280.284s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3280.464s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3281.825s">Um,</a> definitely agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3284.048s">Thank</a> you for all the reports and everything that you brought. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3287.13s">I</a> did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as, uh, if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3300.189s">on</a> their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3301.649s">So,</a> and again, I can't reiterate it enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3303.97s">I</a> think they sound like an old record. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3306.09s">I</a> think Paulette and I both sound like old records, been saying it for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3310.691s">The</a> date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3314.192s">It's</a> something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3322.033s">Yes,</a> you can get the information, but sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3329.795s">My</a> colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other, and you do bond, and you do, you know, over the years, become friends, and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way are you going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3350.244s">So</a> I will get off my soapbox, but, again, look at the date for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3354.326s">It's</a> not a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3355.486s">It</a> comes every year, just like Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3357.668s">So,</a> you know, we all take our vacation time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3360.809s">Unfortunately,</a> I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3367.592s">But</a> again, it's very beneficial.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3448.44s">Point</a> of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3449.541s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3450.101s">Parents</a> have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on, they finally got on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3454.904s">So</a> I know that the high school you've been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3459.627s">So</a> parents are definitely on.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4315.748s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4316.308s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4316.968s">Miss</a> Cugno, I just threw you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4320.409s">I</a> know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4326.971s">One</a> of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4336.114s">One-on-one</a> type of situation the opportunities to change right and then last year he was talking about this year of this academic school year that they had started another program Nexus and that was the one I I forgot the name of it So I apologize, but I would like an upgrade an update on that if possible to say we've been on We've been in school for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4355.905s">I'd</a> like to know like numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4357.966s">How's</a> it going?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4362.852s">Okay,</a> after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5791.024s">I</a> just want to just piggyback on the letter that the superintendent put out to everyone and also to The letter he just presented us for Washington George, Washington I was listening to something today and it really dawned on there's been a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5809.131s">I</a> Don't want to get into politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5810.491s">Actually.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5810.831s">I'm</a> actually asking people to put politics aside on Thursday and <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5818.476s">have</a> your family together, enjoy family, enjoy that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5822.64s">I've</a> heard so many crazy things from me that people are trying to avoid other people, are not inviting other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5830.848s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5832.45s">Political</a> life aside and everything else, really take part of Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5838.295s">And</a> I'm asking everyone just to have a safe, happy Thanksgiving and just really put <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5843.61s">the</a> political agenda aside because nothing changes the way you are, nothing changes our ethics as people, nothing changes the morals that we have, the way we raise our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5857.095s">So</a> that was my thing for wishing everyone and really thinking about it.<h2><a href="../2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo/2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 7, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2200.598s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.318s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.498s">Cuno,</a> on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2202.839s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2204.219s">I</a> just want to say thank you to everyone who does participate in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2207.1s">I</a> know that there's a lot of work behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2209.381s">And</a> each and every year, it just seems like it gets more successful each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2214.842s">And</a> it does take a lot of work for everyone to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2218.163s">I</a> guess one of the things that I never asked, but I guess I'm curious and knowing is, if there's a way next year when we put it on, is as kids are walking in, maybe have a list of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2230.407s">what</a> school they go to, what year they're in, because I know that it is open to all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2235.974s">It's</a> not just Medford High School students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2238.236s">So</a> I'm curious in knowing what other schools do attend our college night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2243.062s">Just</a> a curiosity, because I know a lot of the parochial schools, and I know children that are going to charter schools also come to that college fair.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2252.4s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2253.1s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2255.101s">And</a> even our own students just to know what, I don't need names. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2257.702s">I</a> just want to know what year they're in and what schools they go to.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2998.236s">I</a> just feel that if someone in that position comes out and says, you know, this is a different choice if your district is failing, I just have to say, whether it's political or not, shame on the person who's saying that, because under that person's watch, not one district should be failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3015.369s">We're</a> crossing the line.<h2><a href="../2016-10-19_uB3sO1jLVHw/2016-10-19_uB3sO1jLVHw.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 17, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1976.015s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1976.215s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1977.155s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1978.276s">As</a> far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1996.223s">If</a> we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2002.144s">We</a> do not hold the hat of a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2007.086s">So</a> therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2014.567s">So</a> that's really something that I want people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2018.108s">So</a> it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2023.296s">for</a> the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3009.325s">Okay,</a> and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3012.586s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3013.927s">And</a> the other thing, you were also speaking about the piloting, understanding our differences program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3022.13s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3022.41s">That</a> you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3075.807s">I'm</a> just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us, that we had any part of saying of what schools were going to be piloted or what schools weren't going to be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3118.197s">But,</a> excuse me, but this seems like it's already happening.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3158.932s">I'm</a> not saying no. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3159.813s">I</a> understand that the teachers have a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3161.354s">I</a> guess my question is who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3180.776s">Okay,</a> because I mean the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3889.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3891.972s">Mrs.</a> Coño. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3893.113s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3894.014s">Just</a> a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3894.974s">One</a> is, I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3933.779s">And</a> the other thing is that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3937.981s">The</a> calls and emails that I got were actually, who determined who's identified? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3943.723s">And</a> parents are like, well, my child is in that school, how do I know that, how do they know that that child wasn't near the other child? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3951.945s">And</a> it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls, and different stories go out there for different parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3960.928s">So</a> at least if we could at least advise parents <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3964.889s">How</a> at least we came to identifying the student.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4041.005s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4041.325s">Well,</a> I appreciate that, because like I said, I think it was just parents just hearing different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4046.348s">And</a> I know that everyone's done their due diligence in doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4054.0s">Pero,</a> nuevamente, las historias diferentes salen por ahí, así que los padres estaban diciendo, bueno, espera un momento, ¿cómo puedo saber quién se ha identificado? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4060.365s">Y</a> sin exagerar la situación de confidencialidad, fue más como, ok, cuéntame las etapas de cómo fue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4065.049s">Así</a> que para los padres que están escuchando, espero que hayan escuchado esto, y espero que tengamos esa reunión, que los padres, si todavía tienen preguntas o preocupaciones, vengan a ello.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5110.884s">Miss</a> Cugno, while we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to remove their snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5123.609s">And</a> we've had students that have done it for community service and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5127.87s">So</a> if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5136.954s">I</a> know it's difficult, sometimes we don't have a lot of students, but if we could get something working like that, that would be good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5491.429s">Well,</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5495.671s">Then</a> should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy meaning the needs of all communities, to make it very clear where we stand with this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5513.981s">So</a> that's what I'm saying.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5522.941s">So</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5525.022s">So</a> amending this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5529.264s">Right,</a> so that way whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Skerry will actually have to stand up and express what our needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5538.048s">So</a> that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5556.397s">No,</a> and I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5557.277s">I'm</a> just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean, that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5569.666s">So</a> that way our delegate could express that when he goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5573.969s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5575.56s">I</a> make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5582.303s">Oh</a> my gosh, meaning that it meet meets all communities.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5599.509s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6869.612s">I</a> totally understand that, but again, I agree with all of my colleagues that at least put it out there so that way we don't have different schools saying different messages or sending different messages because I think that was the frustrating part. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6883.183s">People</a> want to appease everyone, but as you said, you don't want to throw out a date and then parents are expecting that date and now we come across as not abiding by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6894.533s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6894.714s">Van</a> der Kloot.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7263.955s">Shout</a> out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7264.496s">There</a> are so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7265.797s">I</a> mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7273.043s">So</a> if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7278.768s">But</a> one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7283.332s">They</a> are doing their Taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7289.236s">Tickets</a> are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7295.92s">They</a> receive scholarships from the Kiwanis and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=753.124s">Mrs.</a> Cuno. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=754.792s">Now</a> this was refreshing, I have to say, and this is why we sit here sometimes, and I'll speak for myself, and this was very well, very well worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=765.49s">why</a> we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=766.811s">I</a> just want to say thank you to everyone, but I also want to congratulate Mr. Plattie for really bringing the ideas to our children, letting them come to school happy, letting them come to school because they want to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=783.428s">I</a> know, I get emotional for all this stuff, but it really <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=787.232s">You</a> know, people think maybe this isn't important. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=789.533s">It's</a> very important, because these children have learned so much about our governmental process that they don't even know they've learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=797.157s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1656.584s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1656.764s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1657.705s">Just</a> a point of information, as far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also, is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1676.781s">If</a> we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city, we do not hold the hat of a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1687.649s">So</a> therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1695.135s">So</a> that's really something that I want people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1698.678s">So</a> it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1703.855s">for</a> the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1722.48s">Good</a> evening.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2665.415s">No,</a> no, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2668.417s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2668.577s">Cooney.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2670.077s">Thank</a> you, Melanie, for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2671.758s">Um,</a> just a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2673.059s">You</a> just, you were speaking about a survey that was given. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2677.161s">Could</a> you reiterate who gave out the survey and where it was given?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2689.915s">OK,</a> and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2694.517s">And</a> the other thing you're also speaking about the piloting underwriting, understanding our difference, our differences program. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2702.721s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2703.001s">That</a> you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2755.152s">Okay,</a> was this, I'm just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us that we had any part of saying of what schools were gonna be piloted or what schools weren't gonna be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2798.811s">But,</a> but excuse me, but this, this seems like it's already happening.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2838.875s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2839.256s">And</a> I'm not saying no, I understand that the teachers have a lot, I guess what my question is, who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2861.385s">Okay,</a> because I mean, the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3570.446s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3572.566s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3572.746s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3573.707s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3574.607s">Just</a> a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3575.567s">One</a> is I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3613.969s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3614.35s">And</a> the other thing is that the calls and emails that I got were actually who determined who's identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3624.332s">And</a> parents are like, well, my child is in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3627.953s">How</a> do I know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3629.093s">How</a> do they know that that child wasn't near the other child? <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3632.558s">And</a> it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3638.76s">And</a> different stories go out there for different parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3641.521s">So</a> at least if we could at least advise parents how at least we came to identifying the student.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3721.585s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3721.905s">Well,</a> I appreciate that because like I said, I think it was just parents just, you know, hearing different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3726.929s">And</a> I know that everyone's done their due diligence and doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3734.075s">But</a> again, <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3735.944s">different</a> stories go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3737.185s">And</a> so parents were saying, well, wait a minute, how do I know who's identified? <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3740.909s">And</a> without overstepping the confidentiality situation, it was just more like, okay, tell me the stages of how it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3748.715s">So</a> for parents that are listening, I hope they heard this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3752.358s">And</a> I'm hoping that we are gonna have that meeting, that parents, if they still have questions or concerns, come to it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4791.525s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4791.705s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4792.586s">While</a> we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to to snow, remove their snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4804.271s">And</a> we've had students that have done it for like community service and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4808.513s">So</a> if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our, <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4817.398s">Councilors</a> at school maybe come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4819.579s">I</a> know that it's difficult sometimes we don't have a lot a lot of students but if we could get something working like that that would be good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5172.07s">Well,</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5174.811s">Then</a> should we admit, should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy, meaning the needs of all communities to make it very clear where we stand with this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5203.582s">So</a> that's what I'm saying.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5210.247s">So</a> that way, whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Skerry will actually have to stand up and, and express what our needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5218.713s">So</a> that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5236.751s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.031s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.171s">And</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.952s">I'm</a> just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5250.323s">So</a> that way our delegate could express that when he goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5254.626s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5256.198s">I</a> make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all me. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5262.961s">Oh</a> my gosh.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6944.789s">There</a> are so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6946.47s">I</a> mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6953.713s">So</a> if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6959.436s">But</a> one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6963.998s">They</a> are doing their taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6969.545s">And</a> tickets are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6976.591s">They</a> receive scholarships from the Kiwanis, and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=900.099s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=900.279s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=901.479s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=902.28s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=902.7s">Rodriguez,</a> to inform us of this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=906.441s">I</a> guess one of the questions I have is that I appreciate everybody doing this diligently the minute you found out about it, but I guess what goes back to me is the fact of if we have children, whether or not they were in the vicinity or not, rumors start. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=922.726s">One</a> story, you know, is a domino effect and becomes a larger story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=927.087s">So</a> I guess for me is why weren't parents informed of not necessarily giving out the information because of confidentiality and things like that, but if the students were talking about this incident that occurred and then they went home and they were telling their parents, why wasn't something like at least sent out saying, you know, we understand what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=949.884s">This</a> is what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=951.045s">It's</a> not this story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=952.166s">It's</a> not that story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=953.802s">It</a> didn't get into a larger scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=957.744s">And</a> I think maybe parents would have been a little bit more confident in the fact that they say, okay, the administration knows about it, the kids are talking about it, but let's see what the story is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=968.45s">And</a> I guess that's my biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=971.331s">And</a> I know in the past when things have happened, and even though everybody's been really diligent about putting a plan together, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=978.22s">It's</a> at that moment that at least we hope that something goes out from the school saying we're very much aware what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=985.043s">And</a> maybe even in that letter saying if there's a child who's having a hard time really understanding what's happening, send them and we'll speak to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=995.189s">Have</a> one of the Councilors speak to them on a one-to-one or something like that just to know that there's the help out there while everything is being placed in a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1005.254s">And</a> I guess that's really my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1008.71s">Anybody</a> who knows us is always talking about the most important thing, whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, is to make sure that we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1015.808s">And</a> that has to come from the top all the way to the bottom, including parents and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1020.07s">And</a> students, especially if they're afraid and they hear something, even though they weren't there, are going to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1027.173s">And</a> the story is going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1030.074s">I'm</a> not saying that the child, by any means, is lying or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1033.315s">But</a> they're in their panic mode, and their emotions are high. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1037.517s">So</a> I guess that is my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1039.978s">I</a> guess the other concern is that, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1042.507s">I</a> appreciate Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1043.848s">Rodriguez</a> coming and giving us the breakdown, but as a school committee member, I would like to have Mr. Johnson come and speak to us and let us know what's going on in the school with the numbers, what he, you know, what he has planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1058.56s">And</a> again, this has nothing in reflection to Mr. Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1061.882s">It's</a> just that he is the principal and we need to get the information from him.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2234.109s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2235.33s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2235.49s">Cugno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2236.275s">Yes,</a> I'd like to basically reiterate what my colleague Paula just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2241.619s">I</a> don't think, with all due respect, it's not the fact that we're trying to hype it or make it into a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2247.664s">I</a> think it's just the fact, again, of something happening a week ago, or I don't know at this point if it was a week ago or two weeks ago, and putting myself in those shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2258.853s">And</a> I think that's something that we all have to think of, too, is that as we speak, we're always saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2265.238s">special</a> needs, and they have their confidentiality. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2269.321s">And</a> even though we do have confidentiality for all students that come to our district, I think parents need to understand that when we're talking about confidentiality, we're talking about all students and not just the students that are in a particular group, because I think that is, again, extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2288.414s">And</a> again, it's just basically the fact of <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2292.997s">I</a> get everything that's happened, but I think it was just the fear of listening to your child come home, we're different. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2299.783s">You</a> know, it happens to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2301.145s">It</a> happens to whether you're young or even adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2304.488s">One</a> person says one thing and then another one adds on and another one adds on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2307.911s">And</a> as a parent, you're home, you really don't know what's going on in the school itself because you weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2313.376s">And</a> now you have all these different stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2315.338s">So</a> again, I mean, something should have come out from the school saying what had happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2322.463s">And</a> I guess my other thing, too, is that this is a very isolated situation with two students that happen to be in the same classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2331.771s">Since</a> it's already happened, is it possible or is it something to think about maybe trying to separate these two students? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2338.996s">That's</a> in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2340.137s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2341.734s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2342.355s">That's</a> all I need to know.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2430.642s">Okay,</a> well, tonight, really quick on that, Mr. Johnson is going to appear before us in the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2437.968s">I</a> would also like for him to have heads up on all the situations that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2442.452s">Rodriguez</a> brought here, only because I don't want him to come here next week or two weeks, whatever, and say, gee, I'm not aware of it, I'll come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2450.359s">I</a> want to make it very fruitful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2452.44s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3306.33s">basically</a> echoing what has been previously said, but I was looking at the report and I just want to make sure that, I mean, first of all, I want to say, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3317.775s">I</a> love the idea that we were able to get this funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3320.516s">Um,</a> and I know that we are looking at the Roberts, I'm sorry, at the Brooks right now, because especially the situation that occurred, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3327.16s">but</a> my biggest fear is always I don't wanna wait till a situation that occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3330.981s">So</a> I also wanna make sure that we're looking at the high school on Winthrop Street because even though we've been trying to put some signs and things up, again, there's a lot of trees that are, they're really low and you really can't see what you're putting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3345.726s">So</a> I just wanna make sure that we're also looking at Winthrop Street.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3352.328s">Yeah,</a> and we wanna make sure that we have the proper signage out there, okay?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4282.574s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4284.136s">I</a> guess the thing is that when you said that parents are going to be asked if their children want to opt out or not, and then you also mentioned that if <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4292.826s">the</a> student decides to do this, they will be informed that depending on the level, some of the information will not be confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4301.429s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4301.909s">So</a> I guess in between that, is there something, is there a form that they're going to sign saying that you definitely informed them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4315.907s">Because</a> my concern is that if we say it verbally, if something comes out that the child doesn't want really to be exposed, they could turn around and say that they were never told. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4326.994s">And</a> my other concern is also if the child is 18 years old and older or if the child is 18 and younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4335.8s">No,</a> it's all students have the ability to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4339.352s">No,</a> but I'm talking about if there was a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4341.894s">Oh,</a> a form, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4342.915s">If</a> there's some type of form that they have to sign, releasing the fact that they know the outcome, if it's going to be higher, it's not going to be confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4351.303s">If</a> the student is 17 years old and they sign the form, then the parents need to sign that form.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4368.613s">It's</a> just that little piece of confidentiality because they could at that moment say, sure, I'll give you, you know, you ask me and I'll do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4376.118s">And</a> then just in case they don't like the, I don't want to say reaction or the restriction from it, I don't want us to be liable saying it's a he said, she said situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4389.686s">We</a> can do that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6138.213s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6139.796s">Mrs.</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6140.718s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6143.219s">I</a> know with any software program that especially when it rolls out, there's always going to be glitches. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6147.06s">And</a> I'm happy to hear that you have a lot of this in the planning session of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6153.542s">What</a> I have heard is, though, I know that what teachers put into the system and what secretaries are putting into the system and what certain administrators are putting into the system is all different. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6164.824s">So</a> even though they have building trainers that they could go to sometimes, especially when it gets really busy, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6172.447s">We</a> really can't pull certain teachers out that have, let's say, learned the program to go and help someone at that moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6179.996s">And</a> I know that I've heard a lot of Mr. DeLaver and actually Mr. Tootin have been helping out tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6188.306s">But</a> one question that did come up, speaking to a few people, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6192.35s">Is</a> it possible, maybe, if there's some type of hotline or something that, I know myself, we're actually, where I am, we're rolling out a totally different program, so we're piloting it, but I guess the question is, is there a hotline that you could actually be doing something, and at that moment, if you have that question, you could actually call someone and say, could you help me through this, because sometimes it's difficult, though, to go and grab someone in the building, and you're at a standstill, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6221.222s">because</a> you can't get to the next step.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6289.638s">And</a> there's this other program that you're saying that you could actually go into the School Brains system and actually look up the question that you might be having.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6415.059s">Okay,</a> we'll look forward to hearing about it, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6417.26s">Point</a> of information, I did forget about Jean Irwin, so I don't want you thinking that I didn't hear good things about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6422.003s">I</a> did know that there were the three of them, I just forgot about her, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6424.684s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8978.122s">I</a> just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8991.353s">That's</a> an important and very important piece of this conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8994.996s">It</a> gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be seen and to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9003.055s">I'm</a> not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9012.379s">And</a> I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9016.881s">So</a> I will inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_P8GypPJIZKM/2025-03-21_P8GypPJIZKM.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Sep. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1515.863s">To</a> still go back, I might need Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1520.525s">Caldwell</a> to come back up, if she doesn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1524.247s">You</a> keep on saying, or you've kept on saying, that the other schools actually do it in a different manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1529.95s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1531.431s">So,</a> I guess my question is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1535.052s">I</a> mean, I don't want to dictate the principles of the school, but if this might be an issue that is occurring and it might occur again, and it has been something that people have been worried about, why doesn't he do it like the other schools?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1582.81s">Because</a> my concern is that now for putting, let's say, all the children with special needs into one classroom, that's a lot for that teacher to be handling. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1593.441s">And</a> so that, you know, it contributes to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1597.786s">It's</a> a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1599.507s">My</a> concern is now, you know, one, is it fair to that teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1604.586s">Does</a> he change the teachers around each year?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1633.403s">It's</a> something that I think we really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1635.885s">Again,</a> we don't want to sit here and dictate what the principals are doing in their own schools, but we do have the right to start questioning this. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1643.47s">And</a> this isn't the right, I don't think the way this is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1647.8s">is</a> probably, you know, thank you, equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1652.144s">It's</a> been a very long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1653.345s">I'm</a> sorry, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1654.606s">Equitable,</a> and it just doesn't seem fair to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1657.448s">It</a> doesn't seem fair to the teachers, and there's just so much coming on, and I just, I feel bad for that particular teacher, even though he might be changing each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1667.136s">It's</a> still a lot on that one particular teacher that particular year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1670.378s">So</a> I think that's something that we really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1673.141s">And</a> the other thing also is to bring up the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1676.404s">I'm</a> not saying to change anything around this year, but I have looked at the numbers and the Andrews has 178, the McGlynn has 148. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1684.32s">I</a> know that it's because of, you know, certain students have to be at certain schools, but it's a difference of 30 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1691.584s">And</a> I think there was a difference last year also. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1694.486s">And</a> I just, I'm not saying to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1696.707s">I'm</a> just saying on the record, I want to make sure that we're looking at these numbers for even next year, because if this is going to becoming a trend that, you know, it goes from 10 <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1706.403s">to</a> 30 and next year might be 50, there might be a reason why so many students now want to go to one school rather than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1714.448s">And</a> again, we're trying to keep the middle schools especially very similar to each other because eventually all these students, we hope, are going to come up to the high school and we don't want to have any animosity between the two schools.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1778.523s">But</a> that's a huge factor.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1816.644s">I</a> know the transition is on an everyday basis too, but at least if we have another number in a couple of months just to see have we received more children into the McGlynn and how it's looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1832.619s">That's</a> all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1833.18s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1843.303s">But</a> I'd like parents to understand that that's the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1846.543s">You</a> just don't want people thinking, oh, everybody's going to one school rather than the other and causing a situation that there isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1852.985s">So</a> thank you for the clarification.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4555.646s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4556.647s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4556.847s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4558.608s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4559.649s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Nelson. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4561.01s">First</a> of all, this report was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4564.053s">It</a> really gave us an insight. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4566.335s">It</a> gives everybody an insight of really what was going on during the year, that it wasn't like the doors closed and everybody went off on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4573.2s">I</a> want to thank everyone for really thinking outside the box and really bringing in new and vibrant ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4581.407s">and</a> it seems like it was very successful for many people and for a lot of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4587.247s">summer</a> time program 10 years and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4590.888s">That</a> was a little personal baby of mine, so I'm really happy about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4594.889s">I'm</a> thrilled that we were able to get students to really see what the vocational school is about and showing them the jewel that it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4604.011s">It</a> has always been the summer program for our adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4609.012s">It</a> just it gives us a little bit and it gives I think everyone a little bit of an insight of. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4614.133s">Yes,</a> maybe we didn't have the money for certain things, but it didn't stop anyone from going and achieving and providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4622.081s">And</a> I think this report is really an extraordinary important report in that it gives everybody that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4628.448s">So</a> thank you, and thank you to everyone who really participated in this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4637.528s">And</a> a little side bit of the students who didn't maybe walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4641.895s">I</a> knew of a student who actually, not this year, but had received his certification after he had done his summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4650.612s">and</a> I insisted that he wear my son's cap and gowns just to take pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4656.476s">And</a> at first he was like, no, but it really made a difference and he sent them back to his mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4662.74s">And</a> for some students, that's the only opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4665.442s">So</a> if we do have our students that have not walked and we are able to do maybe a cap and gown, even to show some pictures and we'll give them the diplomas here, I think that would be really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4676.35s">I'll</a> get you Mr. Blow tomorrow, first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4678.211s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5313.587s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5315.568s">To</a> be honest with you, this is 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5319.67s">It's</a> been 11 years I've either been alternate, well with Paulette, either alternate or delegate or president of the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5328.455s">And</a> to be honest, I don't know about anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5331.536s">If</a> anybody else would love to do this, I would love to see them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5335.979s">Honestly,</a> I haven't checked my calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5337.96s">I</a> know I'm going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5339.14s">I've</a> been going down for 11 years, but either that <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5343.978s">Either</a> that or we just check our calendars to see who's definitely going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5347.559s">And</a> maybe we'll table this to the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5352.981s">We</a> should have one, but we can certainly... But to definitely urge people to tell you if they're going to the conference.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5365.085s">The</a> following week, aren't we?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5374.668s">Yeah,</a> but it's very important that you do tell the Superintendent ASAP who is going down because that way they can book the rooms.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5810.344s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5811.649s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5811.989s">Miss</a> Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5813.11s">Just</a> to piggyback on what the superintendent said, again, I want to congratulate the football team. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5819.717s">It</a> was a great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5820.818s">It</a> was a great community night. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5822.42s">It</a> was a beautiful weather night. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5825.383s">Our</a> cheerleaders did an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5827.725s">The</a> marching band did an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5829.947s">And</a> our new organization that's out there that's kind of taken over a little bit of the old pep <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5835.503s">group</a> that we used to have are now called the staying gang. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5838.924s">And</a> it was just a great, great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5842.004s">But</a> with that being said, you know, first of all, definitely, if you have the opportunity to go on the website, it's mpsa, I'm sorry, mpsadvantage.education. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5854.007s">Please</a> go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5855.367s">It</a> shows and tells you everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5858.168s">But</a> just a couple of things this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5861.088s">If</a> you just want to go out and help our schools and help the community, the crew team is having their first fundraiser at Salvatores on the 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5870.708s">from</a> 7 to 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5872.61s">Our</a> foreign language club is having their car wash at the high school on the 14th from 2.30 to 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5880.137s">On</a> the 17th, we have the fourth Crystal Campbell motorcycle run that starts at 8 o'clock at the VFW. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5886.842s">And</a> then after that run, we urge you to come to Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5893.448s">No,</a> a motorcycle run.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5895.912s">It</a> starts at 8 for registration, but 11 o'clock for... Much later, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5900.955s">Well,</a> if you're going to be on the motorcycle, you have to be there at 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5904.697s">Medford</a> High School Marching Band is having their huge fundraiser at Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5909.84s">It</a> starts at 5 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5911.281s">There</a> are nine bands from all over New England that come. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5916.424s">I</a> think I have everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5917.544s">And</a> I also want to congratulate Mrs. Van der Kloot and her husband, who are the grand <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5924.629s">to</a> a newborn, well, he's a few weeks old now, six weeks, to Charles Scott Ryan, who was born on July 31st, and that is her second grandson, and he's absolutely beautiful, just like her first. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5935.716s">So</a> I just wanted to say that.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gUPvnttl-cs/2025-03-21_gUPvnttl-cs.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Aug. 29, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.168s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.348s">Conyo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=579.429s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=579.969s">Welcome,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=582.871s">If</a> Mr. McLaughlin doesn't mind coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=589.414s">I</a> know we have the report in front of us, and we know that the report is available to everyone, but is it possible, John, just to go over a few things that you've done so that way people are aware of what's been going on?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=870.928s">Mayor</a> Burke, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=872.249s">Cunha,</a> just while we're on that, I know that we have to repair them because of safety issues, and that's definitely something that has to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=880.452s">My</a> concern, though, is that when we go into the capital planning, is that I just don't want to start seeing patches everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=889.295s">and</a> things starting to look old. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=891.836s">If</a> we're going to patch it up and we're going to fix it, I totally understand and doing it now, but I also want to make sure that it looks the same when we go into the capital planning or if it's going to look the same as you repair it because I mean the cosmetic part of it <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=908.822s">needs</a> to be looked at, you know, looked at it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=911.463s">So</a> I want to make sure everything just stays on page and that everything still looks as new as we possibly can make it look. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=918.045s">Instead</a> of, I just don't want to go to any of the schools and start seeing, you know, like one curb looking this way and another curb looking another way.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=943.487s">Right,</a> and that's one thing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=948.391s">And</a> I know that you and your staff and everyone involved has done a tremendous job over the summer and I really thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=954.878s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=956.159s">The</a> carpet in the front where the community, not the community schools is, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=960.543s">The</a> bathroom is where the pool is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=962.886s">I</a> know that we had put it in there temporarily, but it's still very bubbled up because it wasn't laid down properly when it was first done.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=971.594s">I</a> think it's ready for either to get pulled out and yeah because that is a safety issue because kids are walking on that and it keeps on rattling, not rattling, wrapping up that you can trip on it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=985.888s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=987.27s">So</a> that was one and the other thing is that <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=990.408s">I'm</a> very happy to see the painting outside and the crosswalks and all that, but I'm looking still for my signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=997.233s">Where</a> are the signs that say, like, slow down, school entrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1001.476s">We</a> need those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1002.797s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1004.078s">I've</a> seen them in different cities and towns, and it's just, I know that everybody, you know, we know that the school is here.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1017.508s">The</a> vocational side, but the hill coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1019.87s">The</a> temporary ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1020.951s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1021.431s">The</a> hill coming down is really... I've been out there many a times, especially at night during the summertime, and I know people always think it's the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1031.0s">It's</a> really not the kids driving those vehicles that are spinning around that corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1035.303s">And</a> my concern, and that's been brought up many a times, so I'm happy that we're looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1041.428s">And</a> again, it's common sense, you see kids, you're in a school area, you're supposed to slow down, but if we could stop putting up the signs for it, it would be good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1197.504s">I'm</a> just going to piggyback on that and actually a couple of years ago we all had, we all made it a point that we had meetings that were set up to go and visit all the schools and look through all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1209.815s">So</a> if we could do that and include the Tufts, you know, Curtis Tufts School and include all the rest of the schools and we could incorporate that into one of our meetings, our subcommittee meeting, so that way it gives everybody the opportunity to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1223.967s">We</a> all have walked into the schools separately, but if we're going to be looking at this and we're going to be looking at a capital plan that's coming up, I think it'd all be good if we're on the same page.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1912.328s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1913.088s">I</a> know that we have the calendar in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1915.591s">I</a> just want to make it clear that last year, not last year, but the previous academic year, we had Monday nights designated for our meetings and our subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1926.562s">Are</a> we also going to have that extra night during the week that we're going to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1932.102s">available.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1933.042s">So</a> if we have subcommittee meetings, we know it's going to be Mondays and Wednesdays, Mondays and Thursdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1937.624s">Or</a> how are we going to work it out?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1943.787s">And</a> the other thing is that since we are starting <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1948.104s">I'd</a> like to request that we have Glenn Kutcher come from the MASC, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1954.832s">So</a> that way he could go over the rules, regulations, and everything of what school board members are supposed to do and what our roles are all about.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1964.604s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2437.617s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2437.797s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2439.018s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2439.899s">I</a> know the superintendent said that everyone sat down during the summer and went over a lot of this and that's how you came up with the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2446.563s">But</a> did you sit down with like each and every principal of each school and that's what it was kind of their wish list? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2452.067s">Or</a> is it just from the site council reports that we got last, you know, last spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2458.671s">Or</a> how did, how did it really come about?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2507.426s">And</a> the other thing is that again, I just wanna keep in mind, I know that this is definitely a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2512.968s">I'm</a> hoping that a lot of the things that are on here will be accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2518.409s">But</a> just to go back to the comment that you just made to the superintendent, is that I know it's not to always beautify everything and we have to do things that are necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2528.972s">But</a> we also have to always keep in mind is that <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2532.793s">When</a> these schools were built, and the refurbishing of a lot of the things that we're doing in the high school, is that we still always want to make them look as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2544.359s">People</a> are still out here, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2547.54s">I</a> always joked around, and I said that the new schools are always going to be addressed as the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2552.218s">until</a> another school is built. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2553.939s">Like</a> this high school was always the new high school, and it's still considered the new high school for some people, and it was built 45, 40 some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2562.965s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that is a promise that I know we as school committee members, I know the mayor, even before being in the position that she is in now, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2572.29s">has</a> always made the commitment to the city is that we want to make sure that what we have stays as pretty and as new as possible because we know we're not going to have those finances down the road to start building new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2585.964s">So</a> even though that we're fixing and building, I want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2589.487s">That</a> it's not patchwork again, and I know it's been reconfirmed that we're not going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2594.751s">But</a> I also want to make sure that when someone comes through your doors, it's like if you're at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2601.677s">You</a> know what you need to fix, you know what you want to do, but you also want to make sure that your home always looks beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2607.622s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we deal with that too.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2613.266s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2613.467s">Mustone?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2645.163s">Point</a> of information on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2646.504s">Point</a> of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2647.624s">Columbo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2647.964s">That</a> I'm on the site council for that, and that was something that we discussed as the site council, but we knew it was part of the operations, and there is work going on and process going on that that was definitely something that we were going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2658.928s">It's</a> not necessarily the capital planning, but it is internal processing, and as far as I know, that was something that was still being looked at and something that was going to be accomplished this year.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2979.361s">Just</a> to go back on the module units, and I'm not going to get myself fixated on this, but just to try to figure out where we're going, I mean, we had so many students up at the school for so many years, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2992.756s">And</a> I'm going to throw out a question like I know it's going to come to us, you know, from parents that are in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2998.76s">We</a> came to this high school and we had a thousand students in each class. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3003.422s">I</a> mean, the mayor and myself were part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3006.344s">And</a> so times that by four, we had 4,000 students up here and we had enough room for a lot of the things that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3013.728s">So</a> I'm trying to wrap my brain around why is it now that we don't have enough room. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3019.012s">I</a> understand there's more offices set up, and I understand that there is different developed programs that maybe we have now that we didn't have previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3028.76s">But</a> if you could just work on that a little bit.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3118.322s">Thank</a> you for the clarification, because I know that's definitely going to be something that's going to be asked around in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3123.768s">You</a> know, again, if we're thinking of modular units, and we're thinking of putting them where the skateboard area was, I guess, I just don't want a picture like, I've seen how other cities and towns are building their schools, and then all of a sudden, they've built their school that they don't have enough students, and they don't have enough space for their students, and I see these trailers and things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3144.898s">I</a> just don't want to see anything like that happening.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3196.639s">I</a> just want to make clear that if that's where we're going to go, not that I'm saying that we are, it's that type of building that I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3205.446s">So</a> thank you for that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4117.27s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4117.69s">First</a> of all, thanks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4118.65s">Patterson,</a> for being here and thank you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4123.14s">I</a> was reading your resume and it says that your budget exceeds $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4127.408s">What</a> is the largest budget you have worked with?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4166.155s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4167.216s">And</a> have you, when you mentioned the project that you worked on, again, I know it was in a similar, maybe similar, but it was a lesser scale, as we're discussing tonight about our capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4180.087s">So</a> could you maybe compare a little bit of what you have worked on compared to what you think we're going to be working on?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4240.924s">Okay,</a> so basically that's what I was going to ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4243.285s">What</a> type of a financial director are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4246.066s">If</a> you wanted to explain to us what a daily day routine would be for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4251.628s">I</a> know that it changes day by day, but the main basis of the way you work with the district you're in or with the district that you're going to be in, if you want to share that with us.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4683.5s">the</a> transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4684.961s">And</a> if we have a parent that calls you and says, you know, this particular bus is overcrowded and no one's getting on or we're having a situation, what would you do in that situation?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6619.438s">Good</a> evening and thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6621.698s">Could</a> you tell me what is the largest fiscal system you've worked for? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6626.299s">The</a> largest fiscal system that you've worked for, like the budget?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6656.533s">So</a> around 52 to 54 million you're saying?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6660.217s">Okay,</a> and describe yourself as the financial director. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6664.682s">What</a> type of schedule, what type of person, when you come in in the morning, what you would do?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6842.674s">And</a> as you've probably heard, I mean, we've discussed, well, we've asked questions and spoke about busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6849.939s">Here,</a> the financial director would also be involved with the busing situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6854.242s">How</a> would you take care of a situation that arose on a particular day of a parent calling you and saying, you know, this bus is overcrowded? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6863.609s">You</a> know, what would you do?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7524.006s">Good</a> evening, and thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7525.467s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7526.487s">Thank</a> you for being patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7527.448s">We</a> ran over. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7530.009s">What</a> is the largest fiscal system that you have worked for? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7533.191s">That</a> would be Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7534.292s">And</a> how much is that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7541.008s">OK,</a> and have you, what about the school side? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7543.889s">That</a> was the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7544.629s">Oh,</a> that was the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7548.831s">I</a> like to bring your money, to bring your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7553.733s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7554.433s">I'm</a> just trying to put things in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7557.675s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7562.216s">Oh,</a> they are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7564.717s">I</a> left seven years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7566.478s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7568.953s">As</a> a financial director, explain what your day would be and what you think you would be doing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7655.911s">We</a> do, well the financial director here in our city does a lot with the transportation and the busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7661.695s">If</a> there is a situation that occurs and you have someone who calls and is complaining about, you know, the route is overloaded or there's too many students on the bus and the bus isn't getting there on time, explain to us what you would do in that position.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7760.571s">And</a> how would you take care of looking into it in the future?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo/2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo.html">Medford, MA School Committee - June 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=629.752s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=630.613s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=630.773s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=631.773s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=633.034s">Mr.</a> Maloney, I know that you said there's 16 teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=636.356s">Could</a> you tell us the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=637.977s">I</a> know it's us.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=655.752s">That's</a> 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=656.172s">And</a> Gloucester.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=666.835s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=667.115s">Is</a> this going to impact? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=668.961s">being</a> that there's going to be more competitions, there's going to be more games, is this going to affect our busing and our budget on our busing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=710.893s">Okay,</a> because I was just concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=712.633s">I</a> mean, I know that we've traveled far now, depending on who we've competed against. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=719.615s">I</a> was just very concerned, especially after a regular day of school, going really, really far away and then trying to come back home. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=728.357s">That's</a> always something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=729.177s">But</a> my concern was also the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=731.957s">Even</a> though we are using buses now, we are going everywhere with <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=737.002s">going</a> from four teams to 16 teams is going to be a lot more games.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=749.985s">So</a> the amount of games won't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=751.685s">It's</a> just going to be more competitive itself.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=755.046s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=760.077s">I</a> don't know, Bobby, maybe you'll start driving the bus.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=767.603s">I'm</a> really happy with the kids having more competitiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=770.186s">I</a> think that's a really good thing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1528.082s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1529.803s">No,</a> actually everything has been asked.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1618.062s">Okay,</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1621.505s">I</a> was just looking at, when we have all these programs that are going on, Bob, like we have things going on in the Mosh and Can Theater and we have things going on in the cafeteria and, you know, in the gymnasium, and I understand that we're going to have the calendar and everything is, but you are the one who is in charge of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1642.182s">But</a> it's impossible for you to be at every single place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1644.924s">So</a> what's the next step after you? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1646.765s">Is</a> there some, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1648.119s">Is</a> whoever rents the Karen Theater in charge of the Karen Theater, or is there someone from the high school that oversees it while you're not there?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1687.926s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1688.386s">So</a> at least there's someone.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1693.05s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1694.191s">And</a> actually, while we're on, I mean, it's on the rental fees, but I am going to throw this in here because you were talking about coaches and things like that and schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1703.633s">Could</a> we make it a point that, I know it's hard sometimes, but now especially with 16 different cities and towns that parents and students will be participating in, if we could have our coaches please give out some type of schedule to parents for each and every sport because this fly-by moment is getting a little ridiculous and has nothing to do with the two of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1731.033s">Okay,</a> but that and also to make sure that there's a contact number of who and where to contact a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1737.256s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1754.024s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1755.007s">But</a> even on top of that, though, I mean, we had something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1758.389s">I</a> know it wasn't the best of the best systems, because I know Bobby got a lot of calls from us at the last minute going, it just got changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1765.574s">Are</a> we here, or on the other side of the city, or another city completely? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1770.677s">But</a> I think ownership of coaches taking their own ownership, and I know it's great to have the calendar, and it's great for parents to go into their calendar if they're at work, or if they're driving <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1782.364s">a</a> game, but I think it's very important that coaches, and I'm not saying that all or none do this, but while I have the opportunity, I'd like to put it out there and say that all coaches should take the responsibility of giving some type of schedule to the students and have like a night with the parents that they give a schedule to the parent and a contact number.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1827.722s">That</a> sounds great, but we still need to let the parents know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1831.524s">So</a> if a coach isn't relaying that message, then the parents are not going to be able to get that message.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2491.797s">Suno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2493.398s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2493.818s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2495.119s">I</a> was actually pleased that I saw this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2498.622s">I</a> had actually called up MASC and asked the executive director there for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2503.406s">And</a> he had just told me that he had just hung up with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2506.828s">So</a> our timing was really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2509.95s">Just</a> a little bit of my insight on this is when and if this time does come, because it will come, that whether it's MASC or any other type of organization that will facilitate this, it's very important that we do get someone from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2533.119s">I</a> know that there have been cities and towns that have decided to take it upon themselves to do the search. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2538.915s">Honestly,</a> they don't save money, and you really need to have the expertise to really guide you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2547.417s">Of</a> course, ultimately, it is our decision to be made, but I really strongly suggest the decision does not have to be made now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2555.079s">There's</a> no motions to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2556.82s">I'm</a> just saying that when the subsection plan does come into place, it is very important that we go and we get someone that has the expertise in this type of field.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2679.213s">In</a> speaking to the executive director, that is something that we were going to try to do something this year, but it was just that the schedule had been really busy for them and they couldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2690.677s">So</a> instead of everyone trying to fit in a class, we're going to try to see when his schedule is free, and then I'd bring you the dates for them to come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2702.46s">And</a> we could do it like a meeting of the whole, and we could have any questions that we have that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2708.393s">And</a> if you want to specialize it in the superintendent search or trying to learn more about a superintendent search, that's what we were trying to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2718.177s">So</a> that was the point of information on that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2722.239s">Yeah,</a> we've done it in the past where they come and they go over certain things, but I think this would be an opportunity for them to come.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3301.516s">I</a> just want to say that I mean I understand about the meeting and I have no problem having a meeting but to make it clear to people that even though we're not meeting just like the rest of the year is that if there's any concerns any questions any emails any phone calls or any type of anything that I know personally I get I go directly to the sources of where it's coming from and I make sure that I contact <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3324.308s">the</a> superintendent to make sure if there is an issue that is being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3327.91s">So</a> I don't want people thinking that just because even during the school year, if there happens to be a holiday in between our meetings and we don't meet, that everybody's not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3337.435s">Because</a> there's a lot of things that we do do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3341.296s">Yes,</a> it's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3342.157s">Yes,</a> we need to let everybody know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3344.098s">But</a> I just don't want people to think that if there's a concern out there, we're not going to address it until the next time we're in front of the camera.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3740.95s">I</a> just want to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3742.351s">Galusi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3744.268s">In</a> a way, I've kind of gotten to see you evolve, if that sounds strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3747.769s">I've</a> gotten to see her as a school teacher at the McGlynn when we first met, actually, with my middle one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3758.714s">And</a> this is what I like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3761.635s">I</a> like the idea of giving our people the opportunity to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3767.117s">And</a> you have shown that you could grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3769.467s">You've</a> had the opportunity in the last four years to be the assistant principal, and that in each and every day is, you know, it is a training, but, you know, the next step forward is what brought you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3781.528s">And</a> being successful in that training is what brought you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3784.79s">So</a> when I came onto the school committee 11 years ago, and I know that we were looking for people, I remember a school committee member would always say to me, well, we need to make sure that they come from Medford first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3798.178s">And</a> I didn't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3801.76s">I</a> didn't understand why that person would always say that, because I am a person who wants to give everybody the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3807.784s">I</a> still want to give everybody the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3810.052s">But</a> I also want to make sure that we're taking care of our faculty here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3814.955s">That</a> if we have young teachers that are willing to give their time, and they are giving their time, that we want to, on the other hand, give everyone the opportunity to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3824.981s">With</a> that being said, again, I'm not saying that we shouldn't hire anyone from outside, but it is really nice to see that culture <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3832.718s">you</a> know, progress, students get to see you, people get to see you, family gets to see you, and it's not a culture shock knowing that they're going to get a new principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3844.308s">And</a> I just wanted to say congratulations to you for that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4364.328s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4364.508s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4366.028s">Actually,</a> I would even make it a little bit more specific from what we have heard, and that is to be utilized by the finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4375.51s">but</a> with the majority of it, actually, it was for the BN uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4383.797s">It</a> wasn't... No, it was... No.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4395.173s">All</a> right, because the portion of that was we were taking away the five, but giving them, let's say, as an example, 15, they could subsequent use the five for the transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4406.836s">but</a> the rest of it was for the band uniforms because that has been discussed in the past, but okay.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4415.283s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4449.141s">Cugno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4449.621s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5392.69s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5393.17s">First</a> of all, I want to thank the superintendent, Pat Vila, to find or rearrange the money for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5399.135s">As</a> a committee, we all wanted, and we all agreed to what we wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5402.218s">And</a> so I do thank you for that, because there's a lot of what we had all asked for here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5409.784s">I</a> am looking at the middle school librarian that you've added. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5413.286s">Now,</a> that middle school librarian, is there going to be one in each school, or are they going to share that one?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5418.411s">They're</a> sharing that, but they're keeping the assistance that they have, correct?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5441.777s">Oh,</a> so the assistant is going, but the librarian?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5448.663s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5449.667s">The</a> other thing is that I know that we spoke about the kindergarten aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5454.711s">It</a> was important that we listened to what the principals of the schools wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5459.595s">And</a> I think that gave us an insight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5461.617s">And</a> I agree that we should have the full-time aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5466.641s">However,</a> I also think it's very important that we had to listen to what <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5470.44s">the</a> principals of those schools really needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5472.902s">With</a> that being said, now that we are giving the full-time aides to the Roberts, as always, I'd like to have some type of report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5479.988s">Of</a> course, we can't have it at the beginning of the year because there would be no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5484.732s">But</a> at least by the middle of the year, end of the year, an update on how the full-time aides are working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5491.457s">Is</a> it working out to what they were expecting? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5493.738s">I</a> know that there was a lot of discussion on, you know, spending more quality time and trying to teach students and trying to do certain things with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5502.281s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that's that's what is going on, because it is, as we discussed at the meeting last week, is that even if we decided to do this now for the Roberts, it's something that we all have to look at for the district, because that is something that we all want the equality across the board with. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5521.371s">But</a> we do understand the restrictions of the finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5525.675s">The</a> other thing I was looking at is even though I know the McGlynn School principal had written, the elementary school principal had written that with structure of different students now and that there's going to be less students, that maybe she will not be meeting the professionalists that she was asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5543.991s">With</a> that, I still want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5546.603s">We</a> make sure that we are updated on that, that all our students have the ability, that they are getting the time that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5554.449s">It's</a> not just being rushed because I do want to make sure that, you know, each school asks for something and I want to make sure that each school gets <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5563.745s">at</a> least what they had asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5566.366s">Again,</a> even if it's not a full-time position, if we can look at it into, you know, a part-time position, or again, if we could look at it, if the kindergarten aid is something that's more important over there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5584.05s">Okay,</a> so I just want to make sure that we're all clear on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5587.431s">Let's</a> see, there was something else I did want to ask, and that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5592.112s">As</a> far as the HR person, I know to some of my colleagues they weren't involved with this discussion, but I do know that this discussion had been something that the previous committees were concerned with, parents were concerned with. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5607.293s">and</a> administration was concerned with. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5609.094s">And</a> that was we were hearing from other districts that actually had positions of HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5614.036s">And</a> we kept on sitting here week after week saying, what are we going to do to get our voice out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5618.878s">What</a> are we going to do to get more of what our district is doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5622.259s">What</a> are we going to do more to have people understand and know what our students are achieving? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5627.401s">And</a> each and every week, we always came out with, OK, we'll try to have a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5631.743s">We'll</a> try to get some articles out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5634.004s">The</a> superintendent tried to get a blog going. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5637.488s">It's</a> impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5638.908s">You</a> can't do what we're doing in a full-time capacity and still being in the positions that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5646.89s">We</a> don't have the capability of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5648.85s">We</a> don't have the expertise of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5650.251s">And</a> we don't have the networking of it if it was our full-time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5655.252s">I</a> know that there is discussion out there because the amount of money does seem high. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5660.653s">I</a> know that when we had this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5664.088s">I</a> mean, how long have we had her? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5665.189s">We've</a> only had her now for, is it seven months? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5669.631s">Hasn't</a> been the full year.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5672.172s">Yeah,</a> we've only had, that I know that the discussion was going to be, let's wait, let's give her the chance to at least put in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5679.615s">Let's</a> see what's going to be different in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5682.677s">Let's</a> see what other things are going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5684.718s">And</a> I have to say, there has been articles, there has been blogs, there has been, you know, less students going to charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5691.181s">There</a> are less students going to middle man. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5694.103s">Am</a> I saying it was just the HR person? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5696.724s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5697.225s">But</a> what I am saying is that I think it's the combination of the work that everybody's doing together to get the word out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5703.622s">week</a> after week we've been badgered in here saying we don't as a school committee and as a district I mean we were even accused what we had no science curriculum in the high school with the new science labs and everything that we have but we had students in here week after week receiving awards and those awards didn't come from us those awards came from the state <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5724.004s">And</a> I want people to know what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5727.326s">So,</a> again, it's not saying let's not have her or have her. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5730.767s">I</a> just think that we have to do our due diligence and make sure that if we said we were going to keep at least a year to see what the ramifications were going to be, it's something that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5741.353s">And</a> we all voted for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5742.573s">The</a> superintendent brought it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5744.154s">But</a> as a committee, it was voted on.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6803.243s">Just</a> to clarify it, that's what I'm trying to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6806.064s">We</a> are a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6807.504s">We</a> all have the right to ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6809.305s">We</a> all have the right to be concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6811.145s">But</a> this committee is a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6812.806s">And</a> if we're going to be asking for reports, then I think we have to ask them as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6817.647s">I</a> don't think it could just be done every single time someone decides to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6821.188s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6823.098s">So</a> that's what I want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6825.199s">I</a> want to make sure that if we're going to be working on a budget next year, I want to make sure that the administration is putting in their time, making sure that we all get the information.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7058.484s">If</a> you were still there, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7060.085s">If</a> you were still there is that we felt that it was important to listen to also the principals of each and every individual school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7066.569s">So</a> when we heard their requests and what they were really looking for, even though we were all going to look for the full-time aides, we were also told that there were different things in their schools that they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7078.656s">With</a> that being said, we've also made it very clear this evening that we want to make sure that down the road and in our next budget year, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7086.382s">If</a> we're going to be doing this, we want to make sure that it is our wish as a committee to have that across the board.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7477.293s">I</a> agree with my two colleagues that have just spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7479.477s">I</a> mean, we sat the other night and we dissected everything that we wanted to dissect, and we went item by item. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7488.051s">And</a> at the end of the night, I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7491.137s">It</a> was in the minutes I had asked, is this the list that we're all looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7494.48s">Are</a> we looking for the kindergarten aides? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7496.722s">Are</a> we looking for math coaches? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7498.183s">Are</a> we looking in everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7500.004s">And</a> when we left there that evening, we said we wanted, it would have been good, or we would like to have the kindergarten aides across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7507.85s">But</a> we also took out of respect for the principals that came up and spoke to us what their wish list was. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7514.435s">Did</a> they say that they didn't want kindergarten aides? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7517.197s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7518.158s">But</a> they also said, if push comes to shove, and I really need something that I need and truly need in my school at this moment, they told us what they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7527.284s">We</a> sat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7528.025s">We</a> tried to make everyone happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7529.706s">We</a> even left before the meeting was over saying that if we decided to do it this year for the Roberts, it was out of consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7537.571s">It</a> is something that they've been asking for for the last couple of years, that they are a Title I school because of the situation of where they landed, you know, a couple of points off. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7546.897s">And</a> we said, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7547.978s">Of</a> course, and we knew, I mean, that evening, it's, again, on the minutes, on the tape, we knew that the second we were going to do this, we were going to have other schools say to us, hey, don't forget about us, we want the kindergarten needs, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7562.383s">It's</a> something that we've said across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7564.644s">We</a> even said it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7566.065s">I</a> said it this evening before we even voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7568.286s">We</a> have not forgotten about the other schools, but we want to make sure that we also listen and hear, we're not the people in those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7575.768s">We're</a> not there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7577.624s">And</a> we need to have some type of respect and communication with the people that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7582.385s">So</a> going to the city council in this type of vote, to me, just shows that we are not a unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7591.388s">We</a> are not working as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7593.508s">And</a> it's a shame, because I don't know about anybody else, but whether we approved, disapproved, whether we agreed or disagreed, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7601.337s">with</a> previous or even with our own committee here, by the end of the day, it wasn't about being in camera, it wasn't about politics, it wasn't about anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7611.245s">It</a> was about what this district needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7614.328s">And</a> honestly, I'm really confused because I thought the superintendent has done a great job with the financial director in getting us what we can at this point, especially when we're looking at a budget from the state that we don't even know what we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7630.0s">And</a> do we want to be in a situation right now that we're going to say, sure, we'll give everyone kindergarten eds. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7635.082s">We'll</a> give everybody everything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7637.123s">And</a> then come October, when we don't have the money, and all of a sudden, we're giving half of our faculty pink slips because we're not going to have teachers in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7646.027s">These</a> are things we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7648.289s">And</a> so, yes, am I frustrated? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7650.49s">Very</a> much so.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8138.826s">We</a> already called the vote.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8144.29s">I</a> just want to say, everyone has the right to do what they want to vote, and it wasn't about the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8149.878s">It</a> was about the clarification of where we came from the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8153.462s">If</a> we had discussed and there were members that were concerned about, I'm not going to approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8159.19s">without</a> having kindergarten across the board, at least we would have known a little bit better of where we stood tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8165.757s">If</a> we had members that were concerned, and I'm not putting down anyone's concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8170.102s">Everyone</a> has the right to concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8171.363s">But</a> as a committee, when we discussed it the other night, and that's why the surprise tonight, if I had known that I was going to come in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8179.292s">saying</a> that this budget wasn't going to be, you know, I even think the superintendent would have known if he had known saying, nope, no kindergarten aides, we're not going to pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8189.134s">I</a> think we would have at least had a little bit of an awareness.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8198.817s">So</a> that was the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8201.757s">That's</a> fine.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_TdmpFxDKEqA/2025-03-21_TdmpFxDKEqA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - June 6, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3075.077s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3075.297s">Cugno,</a> thank you, Melanie, for bringing this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3078.659s">The</a> way you set it up tonight through the PowerPoint, an excellent job to you and to everyone who worked on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3085.342s">It's</a> a really wonderful way of going through everything and in the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3090.445s">I'm</a> not going to take the time because I know everyone is extremely tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3094.882s">to</a> reiterate what my colleagues have said, but I am looking over a couple of things, and like, under the accomplishments, which I know that you have gone to a lot of the Attend Parent Leadership Series, is that something that other parents could go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3107.893s">Is</a> it something that they pay for?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3152.268s">And</a> how does a parent know about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3154.629s">I</a> mean, is it because they come to your meetings, or do you send out a newsletter?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3226.912s">Just</a> out of curiosity, as a parent who, let's say, has a child with disabilities and they don't know about, you know, the Facebook, or how do they start? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3236.561s">How</a> do you get them to come to you?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3293.571s">No,</a> I totally understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3296.534s">I</a> guess this would be a question for Kathy, but since she's not here, through the mayor to the superintendent, when a child is in our district and they are special needs, do they receive a packet with all this information?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3319.115s">As</a> long as someone answers that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3369.073s">No,</a> I just want to make sure that, you know, you've all done such wonderful work and it's just always the same, you know, as my colleague just said, it's kind of difficult sometimes when, you know, you're running it and you send out the word and you're asking for parents to come and unfortunately it's not all the time and, you know, it's almost, you know, I don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3389.448s">I</a> don't want to say it sounds like the superintendent's night that, you know, you have all these parents in the district and then unfortunately you just have, you know, a small group of parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3397.991s">So</a> with that being said, you being here, being on, you know, at the school committee, having more people, maybe putting it on the blog, things like that, you just hope and pray that word of mouth, it just goes out there more and more.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3428.868s">But</a> unfortunately, sometimes you don't have time until it hits you in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3433.51s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3435.05s">The</a> other thing I was going to ask you about is the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3437.211s">You</a> had asked about professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3439.691s">Are</a> you asking for professional development more for parents or for people that are involved, for teachers, for staff?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3523.965s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3524.345s">And</a> I think that it's important that everyone understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3527.188s">And</a> I know the parents that are involved with this understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3530.791s">And</a> that is the needs of a child are so different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3535.695s">Even</a> though one child is on an IEP, it could be totally different from another child who's on an IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3541.8s">As</a> a parent who has gone through that process, I could honestly tell you it's definitely a learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3552.083s">And</a> I've been very, I guess, grateful to our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3559.087s">Had</a> nothing to do with me being on school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3562.348s">But</a> it was really done very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3565.089s">And</a> unfortunately or fortunately, that's how I've learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3568.171s">I've</a> learned through listening to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3570.572s">And</a> as you said, sometimes you don't want to talk about certain things because you just feel like, well, maybe other people don't want to hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3578.475s">Or</a> maybe you feel like maybe you are, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3581.403s">your</a> child's disability isn't as large or as important or whatever as someone else's. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3587.246s">And</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3588.707s">And</a> when you open up and you start speaking about it, it's amazing how you learn and the process that you go through.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3601.432s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3602.132s">And</a> again, just, you know, always be there for your children to say that, you know, we could try to work it out as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3608.575s">But,</a> um, I do want to recommend and thank you all for your work.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3612.617s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3868.068s">Basically,</a> I, well, first of all, we would love, I'll speak for a lot of us, we would love to be there Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3873.57s">I</a> know I can't be there Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3875.69s">I</a> have two graduating, but we're all going to be at the graduation ceremony.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3880.731s">And</a> the other thing is, I basically was going to ask if we were able to have some type of a list or something that could be on our webpage or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3890.208s">but</a> I think that was already answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3891.869s">So</a> that was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3892.77s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3893.41s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5177.456s">being</a> involved with a lot of the site council meetings is that if there's a couple of things change in the handbook that's fine but if there's going to be an actual policy the policy has to come in front of the school committee but if it's not the same across the board it just doesn't make sense and we have made it very clear here that that's what we want to do so the policy has to be

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7119.897s">What</a> about the Andrews?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7143.872s">I</a> just want to make sure, as you mentioned, that we do everything in the proper way and make sure that we handle it with the proper procession of like the unions and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7152.097s">Whereas</a> if we're not going to post it, we have to do it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7155.78s">Very</a> good.

School Committee, I truly want to thank you and I want to thank anyone who is truly concerned and has a vested interest in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2731.399s">I</a> love the idea of having people come up and discuss their ideas, for this is the forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2736.504s">where</a> this discussion should be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2738.846s">However,</a> I also want to remind everyone as a school committee member, there is a process and a succession of what we as a body need and decide to discuss and determine for the best interest of our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2751.296s">As</a> a committee member or anyone who needs to compare and evaluate, we need to compare one year to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2757.361s">And</a> we are in the process of collecting that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2760.343s">Now,</a> as far as transparency, let's address what maybe I took for granted <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2766.672s">That</a> was obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2768.473s">I</a> will speak for myself as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2771.235s">After</a> investing 10 years, completed years, nine years as MASC, as a member, executive board member, and not to mention the president of Massachusetts Association of School Committees, meaning that I represent of all the school committee members in the state, the projects, the money, the time, the networking in our city, across the state and country, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2792.462s">We</a> have invested, and I hope and think parents, students, administrators, teachers, and constituents in our district would not believe that we, as your elected officials, would have been given this position and will take the hiring of a new superintendent very lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2809.012s">The</a> hiring of superintendent, especially under our circumstances, whatever you agree or disagree, like or dislike the superintendent, the gentleman has been in a position for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2821.74s">For</a> some of you, that may be a con. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2824.142s">For</a> some, it may be a pro. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2826.804s">Personal</a> preference, but for a person who has been around, and I can honestly say and tell you I've been on many sides and have seen our administration work, where many of you have not, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2838.618s">I</a> can tell you we have and are represented very well across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2842.844s">I</a> know this is not the point for many of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2845.047s">You</a> are asking for transparency in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2847.971s">Educated</a> in what the superintendent search entails and knowing what other cities are going through right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2855.253s">This</a> is something that we as a school committee need to sit down and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2859.857s">We</a> have had certain maybe not official meetings, but the discussion has come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2866.043s">But</a> we need to have certain things done in succession. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2869.206s">As</a> I mentioned before, the superintendent has already spoken to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2873.249s">We</a> already knew when the evaluation is going to be presented to us as far as what the next step was going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2883.475s">And</a> so I guess at this point, I just really want to say that we are very much aware of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2889.984s">And</a> it's kind of frustrating as a school committee member to sit there and know the hard work that people in our city have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2898.588s">The</a> children that were here tonight, that shows what we have in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2903.209s">Not</a> only in the group that was here this evening, but in many groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2906.27s">This</a> last month and a half, we have done nothing but give certificates out, not from us, but what our children have achieved in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2915.152s">So</a> to sit and listen over and over again, to listen to people just throw things out that are not factual is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2923.215s">So</a> with all due respect, I do and ask that I make a motion this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2928.596s">that</a> we have the meeting of the superintendent committee of the whole for the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2936.481s">And</a> then we also need to have the meeting of executive, the executive meeting, I'm sorry, the executive committee of, executive meeting for his contract.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3043.578s">Angela,</a> I didn't say it was you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3045.159s">I'm</a> saying in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3046.0s">Well,</a> I'm the one standing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3047.32s">Actually,</a> I said thank you to you when you first came, and I said it a couple of times, actually, that I enjoy that when you do come, this is where the forum should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3056.647s">It's</a> very, very frustrating to be on this side, too, just as much as it is for you that you want to do the best you possibly can for your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3063.872s">But</a> it's very frustrating on this side working the hours that everybody works, not just me, I'm no one compared to everybody in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3071.286s">But</a> to sit here week after week and listen to everyone else discuss our <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3077.8s">Our</a> due diligence of what we're doing for our children is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3081.925s">I've</a> said it to you before and I will say it to you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3084.348s">Thank</a> you for bringing this up to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3086.23s">But</a> you also have to understand that there is a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3090.535s">I'm</a> not saying that the process is behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3093.999s">We</a> haven't been in that situation in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3096.982s">And</a> you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3098.283s">We've</a> always talked about, if God forbid anything happens, that we want to know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3104.409s">But</a> to sit here and know outside of this room that already there is people talking about, oh, we're hiring or we're firing, that's not fair to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3113.877s">And</a> I'm not saying that that was you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3116.058s">And</a> I know that you have children in the system, because my children have been with your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3120.342s">So</a> I am not getting more aggravated at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3123.945s">I</a> thanked you for coming to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3125.966s">But</a> you need to give us, you, the public, needs to give us some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3130.829s">Because</a> there hasn't been time to sit down and do what we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3134.392s">And</a> it's kind of ironic, we can't evaluate something if you have nothing to evaluate it from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3139.596s">We</a> have to evaluate the evening with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3142.978s">Well,</a> we have to wait for the evening of the superintendent, and that is coming up this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3147.901s">So,</a> I mean, I understand the frustration of everybody, but you also have to understand the frustration of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3153.263s">Me,</a> myself, as a parent, totally understand, but I'm on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3157.785s">And</a> it's very frustrating when you know your children are doing 100 percent the best they possibly can, and they're striving, and people just come to you and just <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3167.472s">keep</a> on saying facts that are not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3170.253s">If</a> we're going to throw facts out there, let's remember, I don't know, a little bit of reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3175.676s">And</a> we sit here, I'm number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3177.977s">I</a> started here 10 years ago with let's not bully anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3182.219s">What</a> kind of a message are we sending as adults to our children that we say don't bully? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3188.501s">And</a> we're at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3190.562s">It's</a> very frustrating.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4854.406s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4858.154s">It</a> says that we have to come up with a plan by June 30th also, is that your motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4862.676s">We'll</a> take it one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4864.417s">That's</a> the second one, okay.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5510.37s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5510.57s">Cuno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5511.29s">I</a> just wanted to address what Gene said. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5514.149s">I</a> just want to make it very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5515.269s">I'm</a> not trying to be defensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5517.27s">I</a> just get very frustrated between facts being thrown out and non-factual stuff being thrown out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5523.211s">And</a> so I've gone to City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5525.591s">If</a> you're going to be speaking about City Council, I've gone to City Council many, many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5529.532s">And</a> I try to get my information not only from City Council, but also from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5534.013s">When</a> there's two stories out there, you always have to listen to both. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5537.414s">And</a> it got frustrating to me as a school committee member because we haven't had the opportunity yet <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5543.935s">until</a> tonight to really speak about what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5547.299s">So</a> for that, I apologize if I come across being defensive, but I get very upset and very passionate when I know there's certain things that are not true and certain things that are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5558.15s">And</a> as far as debating and coming and asking questions, that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5563.215s">We're</a> not here for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5564.457s">We're</a> here for everybody else.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6279.64s">I</a> just want to say as far as the plan, I mean, we haven't sat down and we are going to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6284.481s">You're</a> absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6287.522s">It's</a> not that, I mean, having a superintendent search without any type of input from either community parents, teachers, administrators, or anyone from those categories, and including students, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6303.322s">would</a> be crazy for us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6306.524s">I</a> mean, I'm only basing it on what we've done and what the superintendent has done the last few times, even when we've hired assistant principals or principals or the director of the vocational school or our director of finance, is that we have had <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6322.127s">That</a> particular plan, and I'm not sure if everyone is aware of that, is that the superintendent and the assistant superintendents have gotten together, have made a list of qualified people, and once that was set, then we had <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6338.074s">groups</a> of people that we never even got involved with until it went through all the groups that were on a one-to-one basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6346.362s">So</a> I'm looking forward to the fact that that's the type of plan or part of the plan of the groups that we'd want to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6354.369s">We</a> definitely have to have the input of the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6358.212s">We</a> have to have input of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6359.774s">We</a> have to have input of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6361.796s">They're</a> the ones that are going to be in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6363.768s">We're</a> here as elected officials, we understand our position of what we have to do, but we need to collect all that data before we could really go and just make a decision of who's coming and who's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6375.317s">So,</a> I mean, to address your concerns about, I mean, I know that Paulette just mentioned it, but I want to reiterate the fact that there is no way that we could or will pick someone else when the time comes without the input of the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6392.41s">It</a> has to be.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6453.351s">And</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6453.991s">And</a> as far as I mean, having, it's, it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6456.633s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6966.826s">The</a> buildings and grounds subcommittee was called to order at 7.05 by the chairperson, myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6972.572s">Subcommittee</a> members present were Kathy Kreatz and Paulette Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6976.195s">Also</a> present were school committee members, Aaron DiBenedetto and Robert Scari, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6980.719s">Also,</a> Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6983.658s">I'm</a> sorry, also Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of Finance and Administration, Patricia Villa, Director of Buildings and Grounds, John McLaughlin, Assistant Director of PE, Health and Community Schools, Rachel Perry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6996.525s">Community</a> members present include Katie Martin from the Mephits Orca, and Dennis McDonald of the Office of Energy and Environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7007.05s">We</a> all rose to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7008.731s">Chairperson</a> myself asked the superintendent to explain the purpose of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7012.973s">The</a> superintendent explained the purpose as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7015.417s">Review</a> the specification conditions for the proposed winter season bubble on Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7021.886s">Review</a> the proposed facilities, rental agreement, and fee schedule for the Medford Community Schools Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7027.935s">The</a> superintendent informed the subcommittee of two additional comments that must be discussed as we go forward with discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7035.382s">OCD</a> director Lauren DiLorenzo explained that since federal CDB HUD funds were used to remove architectural barriers from the entrance and exit to the field, the use of the bubble would <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7048.414s">have</a> to make the same accessibility provisions as the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7052.157s">This</a> means that the facility must take provisions for low-income and disabled users. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7057.681s">Also,</a> any profits might have to go back and reimburse HUD funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7064.05s">Ken</a> Kraus raised several environmental concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7067.454s">Need</a> to construct the proposed parking lot with appropriate stormwater management techniques, possible impact on the fells, and the size and location of the field house. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7078.589s">Possible</a> impact upon Winthrop Street development. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7082.978s">Dennis</a> McDougall from the Energy and Environment Office suggested that installations of the appropriate drainage as part of the parking lot was a must. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7092.06s">He</a> also would have preferred pavers as an alternative to hardtop for the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7097.401s">He</a> recognized that the cost would be very high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7100.382s">Superintendent</a> explained that Winthrop Street development has not even been submitted and that it would not affect the parking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7107.444s">Also,</a> the field house size had not yet been established, but it would probably be about 1,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7113.606s">The</a> parking lot would not be adjacent to the Middlesex Fells area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7118.09s">The</a> committee then began a review of RFP guidelines for the bubble structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7122.534s">The</a> committee took the following actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7125.017s">Added</a> the words with appropriate drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7128.18s">Specified</a> the fieldhouse have at least two toilets in each of the male and female bathroom areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7135.047s">Further</a> that they be handicapped accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7138.31s">required</a> the vendor and contractor to hold a four-hour open house at least once during the season for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7145.075s">This</a> would be listed as number 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7148.017s">There</a> was considerable discussion on how the schedule of the bubble could provide more time for community use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7153.841s">Suggestions</a> included such ideas as having the contractor start later on Wednesdays, adding a later finishing time in exchange for more time in the afternoon and weekends, sharing space during contractor time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7167.69s">These</a> ideas were rejected for several reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7171.051s">There</a> was concern that the hours available would not be conducive for parents to bring children and youth to the facility during the afternoon hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7180.835s">There</a> was discussion that the facility could provide opportunities for adult residents, like the pool does. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7186.897s">For</a> example, there could be tennis, golf, track-related activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7190.878s">While</a> the adult use was understood, the committee was trying to find more time for children and youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7196.866s">Ultimately,</a> the committee opted to include a four-hour open house

rental agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7220.23s">Director</a> of Finance and Administration took the subcommittee through each page. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7224.913s">Discussion</a> was held at intervals as each member raised questions and or made suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7230.576s">The</a>

parties was raised to $275—actually, while I'm reading this, I just wanted a clarification on this—raised to $275 from $125 per hour, or was it—I don't—if I just want to ask Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7278.231s">Because</a> then it also says, the birthday party rental included up to two lifeguards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7282.634s">If</a> the swimmer numbers exceed 20, then additional lifeguards and apical costs will apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7288.838s">On</a> page 7, the rental fees for Edgley Field were changed. <a

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7400.477s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7401.617s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7964.263s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7967.064s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7971.106s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7971.786s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7973.326s">It</a> was a question on the 48 hours only because if it's certain, let's say it's a soccer group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7979.317s">and</a> because of weather, they don't know that they're going to be cancelling within 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7983.963s">So</a> that was what we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7986.866s">We</a> did discuss that there would be a non-refund, but I'm not sure about the 48 hours.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8058.653s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8058.853s">Cugno,</a> chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8062.282s">could</a> have sworn that we had written it down, that we had come to the conclusion, and we were going to bring it forward to this meeting, of how we were going to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8069.908s">Because</a> there were different scenarios for different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8073.431s">And</a> I think at that point, we were going to bring it here to have it clarified, as far as the time was.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8196.957s">On</a> the Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by Hormel Commission because the rentals themselves, as far as we were told, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8203.663s">The</a> rentals themselves are through the commission, but as far as the usage, I believe that our athletic director also has purview on the times if we have our teams that are going to be playing, and he's here, so he could clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8221.171s">Mr.</a> Maloney.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8326.922s">Points</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8328.242s">We</a> weren't, we didn't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8330.763s">We</a> were told that it was $145. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8333.245s">So</a> when we were looking at, when we were looking at the rates, we actually decided that we want to make sure that we kept our youth programs as they are paying now, because we didn't want to raise <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8345.052s">So</a> the $75 is something- They pay $75 an hour for practice.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8364.586s">That</a> will totally be reviewed, the price structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8367.548s">OK,</a> that's what I want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8369.088s">So</a> could I motion for a subcommittee meeting?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9777.274s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9777.474s">Cuno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9778.874s">I</a> just want to ask about the CPR course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9782.175s">Well,</a> it's part of the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9784.156s">Will</a> the students have options of getting certified?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9812.115s">And</a> is there any other fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9814.237s">adjacent</a> to it, like I know the boys, I mean, it's a different thing, but I know my boys just took a CPOC course through our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9821.984s">But</a> to get certified and for their certification, they had to pay a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9825.747s">So</a> I'm not sure if there's anything.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10603.232s">No,</a> I was going to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10605.393s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10605.794s">I</a> just want to ask, first of all, the C3 day, as a parent, I liked it a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10614.799s">It</a> gave me the opportunity with the boys to go and <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10617.378s">see</a> a couple of more schools because it's difficult in everyone's schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10621.04s">So</a> that was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10622.321s">And</a> I also know that the feedback on that day was really good from a lot of students and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10628.245s">So</a> that was a really nice way of thinking outside the box to make sure everybody was looked at instead of having some lull day that no one could do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10637.891s">I</a> am looking, I'm looking at your goals and I like the idea <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10644.518s">including</a> especially because I'm always afraid of the children that are getting not getting looked at when we're going from one to the other job like I'm you know elementary to the middle middle to the high school so that just makes so much sense the other thing I was going to ask you is I'm looking at the 2016 college acceptances oh yeah and again proud of our students of what they've done what they've accomplished with the help of everyone <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10672.096s">But</a> I know that in the graduation book, on graduation day, it doesn't really say where the students were accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10680.902s">It</a> says where the students are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10683.244s">And</a> I know I had this feedback last year when parents were asking me, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10688.021s">Well,</a> you always say that the kids are getting accepted into all these different schools, but I'm not seeing any of these schools on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10694.764s">And</a> I know, as many of us, because of the financial situation, some of the students are not selecting the schools that they really had been chosen to because financially it worked out better for their own personal financial situation to go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10711.05s">So</a> I'm looking at the list, and I know for a fact we have a lot of students going up to UMass Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10718.075s">this</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10719.116s">And</a> I just somehow, if we could incorporate where the students have been accepted, not only to where they're going, because I just don't want the students need to get the credit for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10730.063s">And</a> I just don't want parents to look at the list and say, oh, there's five colleges here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10735.987s">This</a> is all they've been accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10738.349s">And</a> I don't think people understand that when they're reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10741.671s">So</a> somehow, some way, if we could put that in the package of the booklet, I would appreciate it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10766.187s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10766.787s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10767.128s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11231.801s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11232.001s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11232.961s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11234.582s">Going</a> back to the AP exams, I believe we had the conversation last year, if not the year before, but are we putting students on payment plans if they're looking into the AP courses? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11247.486s">Because</a> I know that the fees of everything between proms and banquets and everything else are all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11254.528s">So</a> I know that we had spoken about if students were interested, they could go on a payment plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11259.95s">done?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11303.018s">So</a> that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11304.299s">And</a> if we could also let the parents know that <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11307.809s">there</a> could be something, you know, work dealt because sometimes the student will go home and tell the parent and then the night before they're like, oh, by the way, I need $300 money order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11316.831s">So</a> if we could, if we could do that, that would be great.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11727.69s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11727.79s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11729.188s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Gerardo, for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11731.429s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11732.429s">I</a> guess because Mr. Zigni and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11735.251s">Rallo</a> are here, elementary, middle schools, and the high school, how are scheduling going with the music? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11745.275s">I</a> know at one point the high school students couldn't take it because of certain classes they had to take, so they had been rearranging the courses around so that way the students had the availability to take the band <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11758.111s">orchestra</a> music.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11771.28s">Yeah,</a> being in the orchestra for sure, because that's also in the elementary and middle schools, and I know that in the past we've had a situation where students wanted to take them, but because of their daily classes, they weren't able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11784.366s">And</a> I know that over the years, it was supposed to be a work on progress.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12014.065s">The</a> other thing I was gonna ask is on the contract that we have with the instrument company.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12019.49s">Up</a> until the fifth grade, they only rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12023.534s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12024.154s">Up</a> until fifth grade?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12027.057s">Both.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12060.025s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12060.406s">And</a> at what grade does the band have to make the decision, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12063.508s">Is</a> it the fourth grade also?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12076.158s">Is</a> there a way of speaking to the company <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12079.841s">Because</a> they've been with us for such a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12082.303s">I</a> mean they've been and they've been giving us a great Opportunity for our students to rent it rather than you know versus buying it But I don't know if it's really been looked at over the years because it seems like it's the same contract that's been out there for many many years we have Yeah a few years ago we did
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12112.794s">No,</a> I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12113.475s">What</a> I'm asking is, is there a program out there, instead of having our students select in fourth and fifth grade, that they go from renting to either buying it, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12123.826s">Is</a> there something that maybe we could overlap it and have them rent it all the way up to middle school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12141.929s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12143.208s">And</a> the other thing I was just going to say, oh, congratulations to the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12148.45s">They</a> were invited to the Hershey Pennsylvania Invitational to go and compete there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12153.832s">So</a> congratulations to them.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3297.54s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3299.66s">Cuno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3300.76s">Just</a> a point of information, with all due respect, and this is great that you're working on this, Erin, and Mr. Scarrialso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3307.402s">This</a> is something that has been worked on for the last <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3310.386s">I've</a> been in this now 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3312.127s">I</a> believe it's been nine years that school committee member at the time, Mary Jo Rosetti, and at the time it was Representative Kyle Scortino who had brought up this bill and had been working on this bill of transportation and mobility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3327.759s">And</a> it's been an ongoing, it's been ongoing for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3333.464s">So</a> I believe it's now Christine who, because of Kyle not being here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3339.123s">Christine</a> is now bringing it along and bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3342.886s">But</a> it is a transport and mobility issue and a bill that they've been trying to be pushing it for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3350.932s">And</a> it's great that now we have more support on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3354.575s">So</a> I just want to make it clear that it is something that has been going on for many years.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6451.884s">Because</a> we had spoken about making sure that there was no one up there during the off hours too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6456.905s">So,</a> I mean, unless we were going to take that under consideration and make sure that it was going to be covered.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6484.327s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6484.427s">Because</a> we had discussed that, and we had also discussed making sure that we would have coverage in the high school at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6490.349s">They</a> don't have access to the high school.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7897.355s">Well,</a> I believe we need a roll call on this, don't we?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8427.535s">I'm</a> just asking if they are going to use the theater, if they could just make sure that they don't bring any drinks or any food into the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8433.179s">That's</a> all I'm asking.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_b-cJrtai7oA/2025-03-21_b-cJrtai7oA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Apr. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1604.799s">Thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1605.88s">I</a> think this is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1608.582s">It's</a> always wonderful to see other avenues for our students to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1613.587s">My</a> question to you is that, is there a way of, instead of like our students somehow, because it is difficult for some students, especially the younger ones to come to the library sometimes because their parents are working or things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1627.378s">if</a> it's possible for our students to sign up for the card in the classroom and then somehow get that list to the library, set up the library cards and somehow distribute them back to the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1678.062s">No,</a> I wasn't asking for all the kids in the classroom, all the students in the school at once, but let's say we had a particular first grade or a particular kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1687.227s">If,</a> let's say, the teacher came to get those applications prior to having the students come to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1696.788s">Okay,</a> so there is a different way of doing it rather than everybody coming to the library separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1703.378s">Okay,</a> so if we could get that information out to our teachers, that would be great.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2221.995s">mail</a> out library cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2223.176s">No,</a> but I don't want our kids and their parents that sign up through us thinking something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2230.199s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2845.79s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2845.97s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2847.112s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2848.313s">A</a> couple of questions to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2851.938s">I</a> know last year you did the France and the Italy, but that was because the French teacher didn't have enough students. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2858.365s">Do</a> you already know how many students are interested?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2873.089s">How</a> about for the French one, do you know?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2884.654s">I</a> know that the students that went last year had an absolute fabulous time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2887.999s">It</a> was an experience of a lifetime, it really was. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2894.106s">Again,</a> what is the breakdown for students and chaperones? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2898.048s">The</a> price? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2898.768s">No,</a> breakdown as far as chaperones.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2909.272s">Are</a> you going to limit this to a max of numbers?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2927.85s">and</a> the students are going to, are they gonna miss, they're going to miss school on Friday?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2938.568s">And</a> so that will be an excused absence, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2943.152s">And</a> as the mayor asked, we definitely are going to get the insurance for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2948.956s">Is</a> the insurance coming all from one place, or is it going to be like their own selection of wherever? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2955.222s">All</a> from one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2955.982s">Through</a> the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2958.604s">And</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2961.106s">It's</a> a fabulous trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2962.367s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2964.069s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3815.253s">I</a> just want to disclose that I am on the site council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3817.696s">I</a> definitely support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3819.358s">I</a> am just not, I don't think I'm, it would be right for me to put the motion out there, but I definitely support this and I am on that particular site council.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4459.346s">This</a> is a little bit difficult for me because I wouldn't really... <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4463.85s">at</a> the end when we had, when this was in place and it said, we'll not graduate, it was really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4470.973s">As</a> Paulette had mentioned, I was in a situation too with another gentleman who was not able to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4478.356s">And</a> it's not something that is just thrown at our 12th graders just like out of the blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4485.759s">This</a> is something that is really spoken to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4490.141s">and</a> to the families since kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4492.484s">I</a> know it's easier said than done, especially when they do go up to the high school, the ramifications of what will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4501.232s">With</a> that being said, it was a very difficult and it broke my heart when I really had to, you know, relay the message to that family that we couldn't change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4512.51s">But</a> with that being said, it's a slippery slope and I'm really worried because I just don't want to get to the point where <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4521.508s">will</a> take certain things into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4523.709s">And</a> I just don't want to get to the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4525.43s">And</a> you know I respect you immensely. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4527.871s">I</a> just don't want to get to the point where, well, it happens to be so-and-so's child over so-and-so's child. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4535.274s">I</a> don't want to get to the point where it's this athlete over the person who's not an athlete. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4541.617s">I</a> don't want to get to the point where it happened to be that person who was in the play over the student who wasn't in the play. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4548.66s">That</a> is my biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4550.362s">That</a> is my biggest fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4551.903s">I</a> want to make sure that everyone is going to be looked at and looked at upon equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4556.647s">I</a> don't want outside influences if we're going to change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4563.292s">And</a> that is my biggest fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4565.594s">And</a> having and seeing the atmosphere and the changes of the high school, and even though this is a very strict rule, I could honestly say I don't think we've had many incidences that have occurred, because I think students know that we're extremely serious about this, and the parents know how serious we are about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4584.586s">And</a> I don't think anyone has really taken it upon themselves to really say, oh, they're only going to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4591.53s">you</a> know, fool around with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4593.933s">And</a> as far as, you know, going back to Kathy and asking the questions that you had asked about the students being, you know, they told, I've had four now, my last two, my baby, he's, they're seniors, and I've participated in the overnight, you know, overnight <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4613.638s">Up</a> all night parties, yeah, and I've stayed up all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4617.179s">And</a> I also suggest, really, if parents want to get involved, that's a great night to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4621.801s">It</a> is really a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4623.662s">The</a> kids really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4625.843s">And</a> it's a great way of keeping our kids safe, sound, and I can't say enough for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4632.906s">So</a> that is really my concern about this little word of may or will. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4639.669s">I'm</a> really having second thoughts about that particular word. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4644.053s">Well,</a> you know, let me say it this way.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4734.733s">Could</a> I just follow up on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4736.756s">With</a> that being said, would it be just Dr. Perrella's decision or would that be a collaboration of both you and Dr. Perrella?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4777.231s">Like</a> I said, it's easier said than done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4781.135s">I</a> haven't been in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4782.736s">I</a> don't want to be in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4785.098s">And</a> I also thought that in the past, even though it said will not, it has been investigated if it was a student who happened to be just there, really at the wrong time, at the wrong place, they still were. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4802.572s">able</a> to graduate, it was really the student that was really in the situation that was the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4809.817s">So</a> again, even though that word was there, it was fully taken under consideration.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6040.109s">That</a> was the line I was going to repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6042.591s">Although</a> we're not supposed to be competitive, it's nice to be competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6046.955s">The</a> other thing is that through you, Madam Chair, to the superintendent to make sure that we send out letters of recognition to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6056.463s">And</a> congratulations to you and to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6059.045s">Very</a> well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6060.627s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6061.227s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7587.747s">How</a> many players could be upstairs in that cage at the same time?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7599.167s">And</a> we have to make sure that the youth programs that are there are also informed, because I don't want, like, everyone up there at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7607.451s">Secondly,</a> if anything does happen, who is responsible for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7612.393s">Is</a> it our school that would be responsible for that, or is it the youth organization that would be responsible for child welfare?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7619.996s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7647.988s">As</a> a school committee member, I just want to make this very, very clear and as transparent as possible that if this goes, we vote on this tonight, one, we're doing this because we don't have the policy in place of the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7664.185s">It</a> doesn't mean that once our rates are in place that all of a sudden, you know, every person under the sun is going to think that they're going to go back up there for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7673.33s">It</a> doesn't mean that every other sport or youth sport or whatever saying, well, gee, they got it for free, how come we can't get it for free for a certain amount of time if we're going to use the turf, or if we're going to use this, or if we're going to use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7686.076s">This</a> is under a certain circumstance because we don't have the rates in place and because of the situation that's at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7694.12s">But</a> I, you know, we definitely have to make sure that we have to have the, that people are being looked upon up there too, especially when we have children running around at all different ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7708.429s">God</a> forbid anyone does get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7710.03s">I</a> mean, I know that you, with all due respect, you have given me the explanation of it, but you just never know when you have so many kids up there, and if there's not enough supervision, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7719.295s">And</a> it's really not fair to put that on just our school system because our administrators and our teachers have a lot of responsibilities going on too. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7728.784s">I</a> mean, I know that if we're going to be talking about the April vacation right now, I know that we're going to be having the April vacation camp going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7739.773s">We</a> can't be expecting the Councilors that are doing the April vacation now overseeing or monitoring the cages. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7747.602s">So</a> there's a lot of things that really need to take in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7750.425s">It's</a> wonderful that we want to help everyone out, but we definitely have to make sure that everything is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7756.051s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8176.511s">I</a> know I've asked you this question before. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8178.632s">I</a> would love to take you back up to the high school or any of our schools and visit them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8182.835s">There</a> is really no more graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8185.217s">A</a> lot of the things that you have seen many, many years ago don't exist anymore and I would love to take you up there or you could go up there on your own and see that our schools <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8194.543s">have</a> changed a lot, and you'd be very proud of what our kids do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8198.126s">And</a> as you can see tonight, winning first place in a contest against Lexington, or having one of our science students come up and winning such a wonderful award and going to WPI, it's not the schools of yesterday, it's the schools of the future, and we're very proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8218.9s">So</a> I just wanted to let you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8220.541s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8221.281s">But</a> I still stand by the principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8222.942s">I</a> understand.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8456.643s">Since</a> it was my recommendation to have this letter drafted, I would say to go ahead to the superintendent, make the edits that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8468.866s">But</a> I do ask that we send out the letter as soon as possible because it has been dragging for a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8474.868s">And</a> I guess it's better that now we have the updated information and we have the information on the letter that coincides with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8483.49s">But</a> I'd like to get this <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8485.81s">ready</a> to go as soon as possible.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8496.814s">Then</a> I would ask respectfully that I know there was a concern at the last meeting with one of my colleagues, and I hope that you will have an answer, if not tonight, but at least by May 2nd, so we can approve this and let it go.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8571.076s">It</a> wasn't necessarily based on just what the Senate was going to say or the House was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8578.324s">The</a> letter was supposed to be based on how it reflects us as a district and how a charter school or the charter schools will reflect us as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8588.193s">That's</a> why I'm saying it's imperative that I mean the whole Commonwealth is already signed on board and have already written their own letters I think it's imperative that we write our own letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8597.956s">We</a> have already been sitting on this for a while I agree with the superintendent that we do our edits, but I really don't want to hold on to this until you know Everyone starts agreeing because if we're going to write if we're going to write a letter until everyone agrees We'll be sitting on this letter for the next 10 years So I don't believe

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=888.612s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=888.812s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=890.133s">Well,</a> point of information, I believe I was the colleague that was discussing it because I was part of the committee at the ASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=897.617s">The</a> discussion was the frustration of schools taking the test at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=902.2s">that</a> were being told to take it via computer when they didn't have the facilities or the capability of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=908.93s">I</a> believe the discussion here was to allow our schools, if they have the capability of <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=916.238s">do</a> it online, then they should do it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=918.981s">And</a> I really don't think that there's a need of a motion because it's the principal who actually has requested that he does want to do this online, because they are able to do it with the computer systems that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=929.873s">The</a> frustration was the opposite side of DESC just selecting or <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=934.718s">I</a> don't know if that's a good way to put it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1592.179s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1592.46s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1596.063s">First</a> and foremost, let me just say how amazed and thrilled I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1601.948s">This</a> is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1605.751s">The</a> other things I do want to ask is, I know when we did the science labs in the science building, that particular grant was for that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1615.279s">However,</a> if there was anything that <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1618.14s">overlapped</a> or touched that building, it also was refurnished or redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1625.365s">I</a> remember the lights in the office of the high school because the ceiling of the high school office was actually the floor that abutted the science buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1637.433s">was</a> redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1638.453s">So</a> in this particular project, is it like that too? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1641.214s">Is</a> there anything above the other parts of a room that maybe isn't technically under the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1648.995s">Will</a> they get redone?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1667.401s">And</a> when you're looking into this, are we going to make sure that everything matches? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1674.367s">So</a> since we have the science labs done, I know we're going to call them the new science labs probably for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1680.412s">But</a> are we going to match that with the new renovations at the vocational side? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1686.857s">So</a> everything starts looking coincidentally the same.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1732.085s">Okay,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1733.367s">And</a> the other thing, I guess, because we are going to be touching <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1738.357s">The</a> cable station. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1740.139s">How</a> would that work out while it's under renovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1742.682s">That</a> would be the next topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1743.723s">We're</a> doing it in the next section? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1745.105s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1746.126s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1747.667s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2368.267s">Again,</a> this is wonderful news. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2371.91s">I</a> know before we had discussed it, it was going to be open to both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2376.954s">I</a> just want to make sure that both the high school side and the vocational students have the opportunity to work in this studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2383.719s">So</a> that's one that I want to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2385.741s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2387.722s">And</a> the other thing is that I know that it's also open to our public. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2392.005s">And</a> in the lieu of it being renovated, is there another place where anybody could go to use any of the equipment per se? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2399.47s">Maybe</a> not in the whole realm of the spectacular way that we're going to be doing it, but at least some place where our students and maybe even the public could go and do something.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2426.186s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2427.067s">So</a> through the mayor to the superintendent, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2430.99s">What</a> was your question again, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2432.771s">It</a> was just basically, is there any place that anyone could go to while this is under renovation so they could do it?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3513.618s">This</a> is absolutely wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3515.519s">This</a> is something that I know is a collaboration of the school district and with the help of everyone in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3521.341s">This</a> is something that we've all been waiting for because, again, it's wonderful that people do things and we have different clubs and organizations that do things separately, but I think the power in this is that we do it all together and I think this is a great program to start with, or not actually start with because I know <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3537.947s">We've</a> been doing quite a lot for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=3541.429s">I</a> just wanted to clarify, Mr. Superintendent, you said Sunday, April 2nd, and I just want to make sure that people understand it's Saturday.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=1579.225s">With</a> all due respect, I think the superintendent should at least explain a little bit because there are a lot of parents in our audience and also a lot of parents that are watching that this is very, it's very important that they know why the reasons are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=1593.078s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=1593.319s">Nelson.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2013.368s">I</a> just want to double check and make sure that I have the correct dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2016.169s">Usually</a> we start the kindergartners a week after the older kids start. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2020.451s">So</a> is kindergarten starting on 9-7 this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2024.053s">7th.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2024.633s">The</a> 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2025.693s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2026.494s">And</a> you also mentioned that the professional four half days, the Wednesdays, are going to be used for mandated professional days. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2034.437s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2035.175s">So</a> will students be told that they can't stay after school on those days, or how are they going to work those out?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2140.949s">And</a> this pertains just to the elementary school teachers?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2198.428s">That's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2199.069s">That's</a> really good.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2480.932s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2481.553s">Duda.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2481.913s">Brief</a> report. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2484.455s">I</a> know that we don't have the SCTs and the PSETs to pay for anymore, so that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2488.91s">But</a> how about guidance Councilors, like especially the seniors that have to pay for transcripts and things like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2495.134s">Is</a> any of that included into this type of payment plan?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2514.205s">Okay,</a> so I think it would be a good idea maybe if we could, through you to the superintendent, maybe ask the guidance council department to get in touch with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2524.633s">Beeler</a> about, especially seniors that need like transcripts, because the students have to pay for transcripts and they have to pay for different things, especially when they're applying to colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2533.901s">So</a> instead of bringing in checks and money orders, if we could do it like that, it would be a lot easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2540.786s">And</a> the other thing I was gonna ask you is the buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2545.441s">the</a> students that pay for their bus fees, that they buy the MBTA cards, would that be involved and incorporated in this, or does that have to still count? <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2553.247s">I'm</a> working on it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S2_JZKlpB_Y&t=2565.355s">All</a> right, thank you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1552.72s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1552.92s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1555.584s">First</a> of all, I just want to make sure that we have it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1558.328s">I</a> know that when we spoke and we made the decision of canceling, at that point in time, I know that we had discussed and I know that after our meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1567.788s">I</a> believe Paulette and myself had discussed with a lot of the parents that we were going to try to do something, and with the superintendent too, that we were going to try to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1576.471s">If</a> we weren't going to be able to get all the money back, we were going to try to do something in its place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1582.052s">So</a> I guess at this point in time, through <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1584.913s">through</a> you to the superintendent, is there anything that we've come up with to do for the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1590.357s">Like,</a> we were going to do something in its place because we couldn't bring the students to Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1594.7s">We</a> were going to try to do something for the students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1597.182s">That</a> was the last we had spoken about it, and we were talking about maybe trying to get representatives and some of our state legislators and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1605.928s">maybe</a> even some of our congressmen to come and have a breakfast or something with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1611.331s">And</a> I knew that at that point in time when we were speaking to some of the parents that were here, they felt, and please, you know, I apologize if I'm speaking for you, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1622.785s">But</a> I think at that point in time, you were okay in place of the $230 if we couldn't get everything, because the parents felt that they were getting something in its place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1632.992s">Because</a> unfortunately, it is something that is beyond our control. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1637.676s">And</a> to be honest with you, that's where I thought we were at this point in time, because we were going to try to do something later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1644.04s">Can</a> you respond?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1686.531s">Is</a> there any at this point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1688.294s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1690.135s">As</a> you said, $230 for some people might not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1691.837s">32</a> students at $230 is $7,360 for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1692.597s">Because</a> this is out of our control, is there anything else the insurance company or the agency will do to work with us to try to pick up on that 25%? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1697.002s">So</a> we pursued them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1738.044s">Honestly,</a> speaking to the students that were here that evening, I think they were so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1742.965s">And</a> yes, it was about the money, but it was also the point of they were really looking forward to meeting and sitting down with their legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1750.707s">And</a> really, they had concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1753.048s">They</a> had questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1754.308s">They</a> were very motivated in doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1756.469s">And</a> honestly, I think that if we could really try more diligently in trying to really work something out in working out some type of a meet and greet or a breakfast or something for this group, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1767.912s">I</a> think, honestly, that would really rectify this whole situation.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1790.372s">But</a> more importantly is that even though you come back to us and you have that <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1794.514s">you</a> know, that communication with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1797.956s">It's</a> more important that we have the communication with the parents and the students that are involved.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=1804.28s">But</a> we have to do that because I mean, this has been going on since November and it's not fair to them if we don't have that communication.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2460.075s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2460.275s">Cuno,</a> just a couple of clarifications I'd like to ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2464.517s">I</a> know you said that the students were the ones that filled out the insurance forms, but didn't you have to sign them?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2474.461s">Without</a> a parent's signature?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2484.285s">The</a> reason I ask is because, actually, two of my sons just went on a school trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2490.102s">And</a> we went through everything, and they filled out a lot of the forms, but everything came back to us because everything had to be signed by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2498.067s">So</a> it's very unusual that an insurance is bought and paid for without a signature on the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2503.75s">That's</a> why I was asking that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2505.651s">So</a> that was one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2506.892s">Two,</a> this isn't a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2509.153s">It's</a> just only a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2516.117s">a</a> past president of what's called the Massachusetts Association of School Committee members, we do have the Day on the Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2523.218s">And</a> in the past, the Day on the Hill down at the Statehouse in Boston, and in the past, we have been able to bring students with us from the high school to the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2532.56s">It's</a> a day that we go and we advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2535.161s">It's</a> almost like a miniature day of the day in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2538.842s">And</a> it's a day that we go and we advocate with our legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2542.802s">And</a> if we could work something out maybe with our students, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2546.624s">And</a> bring the students that were supposed to go on that trip and bring them down to the statehouse that day I could help facilitate and bringing them to the legislators that day and have them represent the school while we're there and also work something out with them ASC and We could work something out in that way and not to discourage or try to cover anything up I have gone to DC probably for the last <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2571.996s">eight</a> years to advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2574.117s">And</a> even though we are supposed to be sitting down with our congressmen and women, there's a lot of times that we sit down with their staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2581.821s">So</a> please let the students know that just because they Skyped with their staff member, it didn't necessarily mean it was because they Skyped. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2589.224s">It</a> could have been that they could have sat down with that person, too, if they had gone in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2593.426s">So</a> that's just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2594.927s">I</a> was throwing it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2597.268s">Maybe</a> we could do that in compensating <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2602.208s">maybe</a> for the money, again, only a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2606.291s">To</a> bring 32 students down to Boston, we're gonna need a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2609.993s">So</a> instead of maybe reimbursing the money for the trip, maybe we could cover the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2616.378s">Only</a> a suggestion to throw out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2618.139s">But</a> I think it would be something that maybe we shouldn't go ahead and vote on tonight, but maybe have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2626.385s">Valdez</a> bring that back to the students and to the parents and see if that's what they wanna do.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3638.242s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3638.502s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3640.053s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, in which way, in what ways are we going to try to outreach to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3645.255s">Are</a> you going to try to find out in which district they go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3649.057s">Are</a> we going to ask them to come and visit our school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3653.758s">Diane</a> is working on that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3692.648s">No,</a> that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3693.788s">I</a> think that the personal touch is the best that possibly could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3698.409s">And</a> just giving them that opportunity of being welcomed to the school and showing them the school that their children would be going at, rather than just a letter stating, this is where you'd be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3710.752s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3711.733s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3712.253s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3713.273s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3936.817s">I</a> unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to go to the school, but I am thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3944.283s">Because</a> for the last year and a half, actually, I've been speaking to Janet Donnelly, who is the director of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3950.408s">And</a> this was something that I really felt needed to be done for our community, and I'm really happy that it's finally being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3957.974s">As</a> the superintendent, as the mayor said, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3960.576s">it's</a> definitely a win-win situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3962.177s">It</a> gives the opportunity for our students to go out there and work in our community, but give them the opportunity to work in the fields that they're thinking of maybe going into, but also giving the community, the business community, the sense of what type of students we have and, you know, making, giving them pride of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3982.771s">One</a> thing I was concerned about, and I know that I've spoken to Amelia Westmark about this, and I have spoken to <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3988.244s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3988.444s">Donnelly</a> about this is that I'd like for our students to work in the businesses, but I also want to make sure that we don't take advantage of students, that everything isn't always done just in internship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4002.015s">If</a> we see that our students are really working in these businesses and they're thriving, is that the businesses will stop paying our students too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4012.203s">Years</a> ago, we had work-study at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4016.006s">We</a> had open campus, which I'm not going for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4017.987s">I</a> don't want open campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4020.048s">But</a> I do know that we did a new work study. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4022.368s">And</a> our work study was that we did get jobs, and then we got paid for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4026.31s">So</a> I'm just absolutely thrilled that we're giving our students this opportunity and that our businesses are seeing what our students are all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4033.652s">So</a> I'm really happy about this.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5046.612s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5046.812s">Conyo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5048.713s">I</a> just want to go back to what Erin said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5050.895s">I</a> mean, she mentioned something about this company using our fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5054.558s">I</a> mean, I understand that the baseball, the batting cages are new, but I mean, you read something about them using our fields for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5063.685s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5065.291s">Does</a> Mr. Maloney know anything about them using our fields for the last four years?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5073.983s">Because,</a> I mean, not for anything, but I remember distinctly sitting down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5079.186s">We've</a> had numerous committees of the whole discussing the process, the structure, the fees of the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5086.189s">We</a> sat down with Mr. Maloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5088.23s">We</a> made sure that I remember this full discussion of making sure everything was going to be across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5094.934s">We</a> didn't want to give one organization <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5098.375s">One</a> fee and another organization a different fee because we didn't want to start that game and now You know, we're sitting here saying four years later now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5107.819s">We</a> don't know and I'm not blaming anybody I think I'm sorry.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5114.382s">Well,</a> that's why I wanted to make sure I want to ask mr. Maloney or Let me say it this way.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5190.413s">I</a> concur with Darren as far as, you know, when Mr. Maloney got this position, it was the athletic department and it was at that point in time our pool was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5202.798s">The</a> fields had just opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5204.178s">We</a> really didn't have the batting cages. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5205.779s">The</a> rink wasn't around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5207.32s">Now</a> things are really setting up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5209.08s">I</a> think it is definitely time that, like you said, we were going to have this discussion anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5213.342s">It's</a> definitely a time that we're trying to make more money for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5217.223s">We</a> know in the last few years, we've talked about our community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5220.343s">We've</a> talked about bringing in more courses and classes that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5224.884s">And</a> it's impossible for one person to take care of it all and then not have something fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5231.045s">So,</a> you know, it's due time that we look at this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5234.286s">I</a> definitely agree that it's definitely something that we have to look at quicker rather than, you know, sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5241.367s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5242.607s">van</a> de Kloot.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5383.756s">Yes,</a> I did, actually, only because I know that you said to put it, to place everything on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5388.698s">I'm</a> just concerned with the people that actually, or organizations that actually have contracts to utilize our gym or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5398.222s">I</a> don't want to see them not utilize it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=5407.308s">There</a> was no additional on there, so could we amend that?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1669.107s">First</a> of all, Michael, I want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1670.888s">Thank</a> you to you, to Rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1672.889s">This</a> is amazing, because this is, I know, this was very critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1679.353s">It's</a> been a critical topic for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1682.735s">It</a> unfortunately came to really fruition last year when we did lose a lot of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1691.601s">I</a> know that we lost students prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1694.445s">But</a> last year it really hit home when we lost a lot of students, one right after the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1700.334s">You</a> just mentioned a few families, that it was one week, one right after the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1709.292s">And</a> you just mentioned three of our students out of 24 that are participating in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1714.775s">And</a> this is when we talk about bringing the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1718.156s">This</a> is when we talk about really working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1721.077s">And</a> not only in administration, but when we talk about all tiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1726.18s">And</a> when we talk about all tiers and bringing everyone together and making it not only into the community, but making it really feel like it's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1734.104s">So</a> I really, truly want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1737.505s">for</a> that, because that in itself and the spirit of that brings it all to where it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1745.431s">So</a> I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1747.352s">And</a> I really want to tell the kids, not only to the three of you, but just to bring it back to the school and say how much we do appreciate what you've done and how much it really does mean to all of us when you all stand up and really show what it means to you, because it is important that you all show <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1767.285s">and</a> express how important it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1771.468s">So</a> I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1772.669s">I</a> really, truly do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1774.07s">So</a> I just want to say our support is with you, and I'll definitely be there Wednesday night.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1927.339s">I</a> just want to ask, as far as, I know it includes the elementary and the middle schools, why not the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1934.141s">Is</a> that part of the criteria of the grant, or is that something that you just didn't want to focus on? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1939.303s">Because</a> I know that the high school students are involved.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3873.233s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3875.734s">The</a> whole report, I know the superintendent is saying not to get frustrated, but I'm frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3881.697s">As</a> he said, the commissioner of education has constantly said that he was definitely going to look at the formula of growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3890.972s">And</a> this has changed everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3894.293s">How</a> do you look at the formula of growth and not look at needs improvement to proficient and not scaleless with any extra points? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3902.537s">Totally</a> don't understand that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3905.258s">It's</a> like he's changed the formula upside down without informing anyone at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3910.801s">You</a> can't change the formula in the middle of this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3914.922s">It</a> does not make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3916.785s">And</a> changing everything in the middle of students taking tests is just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3921.086s">It's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3922.846s">So</a> what I do suggest and advise maybe is just as much as you've reached out to the superintendents association is also to reach out to MASC and hopefully between the two associations try to get more support. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3941.81s">And</a> to try to look into the process of appeals, because this is definitely something that cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3946.053s">I</a> mean, we can't sit back on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3948.535s">And</a> as you said, Superintendent, I'm sure we're not the only ones that have gone through this, and I'm sure we're not the only ones that are upset over something like this, because <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3958.22s">You</a> can't change the playing field like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3960.965s">You</a> have students, administration, everyone investing into this and doing what is being asked of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3968.897s">And</a> then in the middle of it, you just change it all? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3973.335s">It's</a> just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3974.555s">It's</a> just absolutely not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3976.036s">And</a> it's very frustrating, especially when you see the commissioner and he stands there and he tells you that this is how we're all going to work together and this is how we're all going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3985.877s">And</a> then it seems like it's a slap in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=3989.118s">Very</a> frustrating.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6675.883s">Yeah,</a> if I may, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6678.084s">The</a> BN Director was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6680.886s">She</a> was going to actually put this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6684.128s">They</a> just found out about it at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6686.549s">She</a> was going to put it on the agenda, but she didn't realize that we were going to meet on the 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6691.092s">And</a> the agency that has been contracted had told her that they needed to have the approval by the 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6698.135s">And</a> if she didn't give them an answer, then she would lose the spot because there are other invitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6703.538s">So</a> that's the reason.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6746.075s">7</a> in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6747.476s">I</a> should have probably disclosed that both of my children are on it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U/2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 25, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2446.391s">Okay,</a> because that made me feel better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2449.135s">Now</a> $52,000 divided by three years or just for this year?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2475.413s">Okay,</a> so this particular grant then is just for this year, and then you would have to re-assess? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2480.376s">I</a> have to rewrite a grant in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2482.797s">Okay,</a> and if you have to rewrite it, would it be for that particular year, or would it be like, you think, in a three-year span?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2504.855s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2504.995s">And</a> the $500 for the kindergarten teachers, is that included within the money that they're giving us, or is that above the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2510.637s">That's</a> included in the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2511.578s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2512.058s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2513.359s">But</a> we have to spend $500 in the supplies like they're saying.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2728.326s">I</a> just want to add actually, I love this idea because it's hands on and it's something that I know that we've been talking about for a long time because of all the testing that goes around our academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2740.017s">This</a> is just a great opportunity, especially for young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2743.271s">That</a> it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2744.352s">It's</a> difficult when they have like, you know, IEPs or they're coming from a different culture or they're coming, you know, they don't know the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2751.6s">This</a> is hands on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2753.162s">And</a> it not only brings what they're learning to it, but it brings the community and the social part of it, which is just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2761.411s">Now,</a> is this going to be something that all the schools are going to be involved with?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2788.234s">And</a> I don't know if it's possible to do, but I was just thinking just for a fun thing, maybe at the end, is to try to put all <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2796.65s">the</a> projects together and actually put it out as a display where people could come and see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2801.512s">And</a> the students could actually see, you know, what they've done.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2813.018s">Well,</a> see, I just got to start.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2857.579s">but</a> at the end of the school year, we actually did it up at the high school, and everyone came, and it was really a nice, it was really joyful to see the students, as you said, take their ownership of it, but it was nice to see a nice, it was competitive, but it was in a nice way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2873.642s">It</a> wasn't really competitive that we have to take your school down, but just to really see what everybody did, and it actually gave a great opportunity to a community to come in and see what the students were doing.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3251.097s">First</a> of all, again, Heidi, thank you for all your work for you and your staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3259.979s">You've</a> done a tremendous job in such a short amount of time.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3295.149s">Which</a> would make sense, but I was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3296.81s">So</a> is it basically the reasoning is because we don't have the teacher in place for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3302.917s">for</a> the hospitality and design?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3320.927s">And</a> out of everything that we've already, that we already offer and what you're trying to place now, um, do you see any other type of, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3329.845s">major</a> that maybe we should be really looking into that we haven't touched upon yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3335.308s">There</a> are a lot.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3368.703s">Okay,</a> and I mean, you've seen the numbers and what students are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3374.229s">Would</a> you say that what you just said to, you know, the two things that you just mentioned, the informational technology and the plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3380.697s">I</a> mean, I know that plumbing has been something that's been really on the top of our list for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3385.522s">So</a> what stops us from having the plumbing part of this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3426.75s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4537.229s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4538.269s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4538.349s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4540.87s">With</a> all the bed frames that they need to make and the kids, I'm just curious in knowing, is it all going to be incorporated during the day during their academic, well, not their academic week, but the week that they're hands-on? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4551.133s">Or</a> is this something that they're also going to be doing like after school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4587.305s">It's</a> a great way of putting both sides together, and if there's any, you know, like sometimes, I know the National Honor Society has a lot of things going on, but not just to target particular groups, but to open it up to all students would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4599.711s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5732.472s">Just</a> an amendment to that, which is to make sure that we have the opportunity of sitting down first with the priorities that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5740.778s">So</a> as our meetings come up, we're going to be having all our budget meetings with all our different directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5747.002s">I</a> think it would be a good idea maybe just to hold off a little bit on just this one topic and make sure that we have a list of everything that we want to talk about because it's something that I know I'm sure all of us have had these conversations with our representatives and our senator and we continue on fighting for these things but I think it would be a good idea maybe to sit down <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5767.496s">not</a> just with one particular item, but maybe with a few things that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5771.5s">And</a> after the governor's budget is looked into.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6873.398s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6873.558s">OK?</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6875.699s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6877.059s">I</a> just want to, I mean, the online learning is wonderful, but I think we really do have to look at who we are targeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6884.263s">And</a> I believe this particular program is targeting students that are not doing well in school, that maybe are lower income students, that maybe are students that, you know, English is their secondary language, students that are on IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6899.029s">Some</a> of these parents don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6901.33s">laptops</a> to have their students take anything online. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6903.792s">So</a> we really have to be very conscious of that, which I know you all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6907.356s">The</a> other thing I want to say is that these have been very successful grant programs year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6913.622s">And</a> I know that the money is diminishing unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6916.704s">But</a> it's something that I know that I've spoken about in the past and that is, this is to get students that are on the curve of <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6925.678s">not</a> making it through and failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6928.66s">I</a> really, truly believe that we need certain programs like this for students that are not failing, that students are looking for that extra help, for parents that are looking for tutors and that they're paying for them on their own after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6942.747s">And</a> if we somehow maybe, you know, small baby steps could take a couple of the things that you're doing here and maybe offer them as a community schools type of program where parents can pay, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6955.26s">but</a> I guarantee you it'll probably be a lot less than what they're paying for private tutors, would take the opportunity to come back to our school at night or on a Saturday morning, because one, it's convenient for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6968.063s">Two,</a> it's just easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6969.363s">Three,</a> it's an environment where the students are used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6972.584s">And</a> C, even if we pilot that type of program to see where <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6977.485s">I</a> mean, I always have parents out there saying that they're looking for tutors, they're going out, they're paying on their own, why can't we do anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6988.188s">I</a> try to explain that, you know, the grants are the grants and we have to abide by certain criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6994.43s">I'm</a> looking at it, okay, if we do a couple of these types of programs, and we do charge, and we bring in money, then maybe we are able to put it towards something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7003.917s">Even</a> if we start at a very bare minimum, just to make sure that we cover the salary of the teacher teaching this course. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7011.462s">And</a> we don't have to put a lot of students in there, just a few, just to see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7015.444s">But</a> that's where I would like to see these particular types of programs.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21__38fWkPIfZM/2025-03-21__38fWkPIfZM.html">Medford School Committee - Dec. 7, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2177.992s">Thank</a> you, and thank you for all the information that you brought this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2182.335s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2184.836s">First</a> of all, when you're saying that we're going to be doing it in paper and pencil, and if we go with PARC, how are we going to compare? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2196.004s">Are</a> there going to be any comparisons of scores? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2199.089s">because</a> I know that last year when we did the parks, there was park testing and there was park scores, but we really couldn't evaluate both because some people were on MCAS, some people were on park. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2210.518s">So</a> if we go to park, do our kids get the grades and the scaling and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2218.003s">Are</a> we going to be exempt from whatever comes out on our stats, if that even makes sense?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2312.324s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2320.549s">You</a> know, I said it many years ago when we started this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2324.615s">I've</a> said it at MCAS, I've said it at the Massachusetts Association, and I've actually said it holding my seat at the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2336.011s">And</a> that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2337.793s">I</a> knew this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2339.215s">I</a> mean, they said you could have MCAS, they said you could have PARCC, now they turned around, oh no, PARCC's not going to work, so we'll make up another name, but we're really taking the PARCC test. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2349.446s">And</a> I don't know if they think we're really that foolish. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2352.899s">or</a> what they're thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2354.661s">But</a> the fact remains is that we all are going to be taking a park test, we're just calling it a different name. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2360.425s">That's</a> basically the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2362.567s">And</a> they had parents going to meetings, and I am, I'm very upset with the Department of Education, because I feel at this point, they've taken like, they think they've taken everybody for fools, but they haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2375.952s">asking</a> parents what their opinions are, asking administrators what their opinions are, myself going around the state trying to figure out who wants to take PARCC and who doesn't want to take PARCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2385.32s">And</a> now it seems like, oh, well, we listened to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2388.963s">We're</a> not going to do the PARCC anymore, but we won't do the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2393.307s">We'll</a> just call it something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2395.529s">But</a> now we're sitting here, and we're actually looking at examples of a PARCC test. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2399.973s">We're</a> not looking at examples of an MCAS test. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2403.035s">And</a> that, for me, is like a slap in the face from the Department of Education to everyone who's put extremely hard work into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2412.284s">And</a> now, you know, we have to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2414.465s">We</a> have no choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2416.027s">And</a> we all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2417.148s">I</a> just want to make it very clear that I know that we're not all fools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2422.112s">And</a> my concern is taking this test, is they're going to be playing with all these numbers like they did the last time around, because all of a sudden the numbers of MCAS weren't up to par as the PARC grading was. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2437.18s">And</a> my concern now is where do we stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2439.981s">Because</a> I don't want to sit here and all of a sudden hear next year that because we took PARC and the other districts are going to be forced to do the same thing, is that all of a sudden our students now have gone <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2452.467s">So</a> I guess that's really the bottom line, is my concern of the kids aren't going to be performing worse.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2568.436s">Well,</a> that's, I guess the frustration part for me is that part, that part of, okay, there are going to be a lot more, and I totally agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2577.841s">I</a> know that there's going to be a lot more districts taking the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2580.842s">My</a> concern is, are they going to keep us level for at least a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2585.985s">to</a> make sure that the test has been implemented the proper way, that everyone gets the fair and right opportunity to take this, and then assess this the following year, rather than throwing out these numbers next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2598.275s">Because</a> my concern is that if we're sitting here, and somehow they're going to try to figure out, you know, we have to compare it to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2605.241s">Well,</a> last year we took MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2607.303s">If</a> we take the PARCC this year, and they try to compare those two scores, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2613.368s">as</a> you said, they're going to be apples and oranges, but I don't want to sit here and feel that our kids have really come a long way and they've reached goals and in, you know, their own individual scores and their individual goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2627.035s">And</a> then all of a sudden, like Parky that comes out that we look like we haven't done anything and these kids have failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2635.26s">So</a> I guess to the superintendent, let me just put it this way.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2806.178s">Well,</a> I didn't really, I wasn't me getting into the political thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2809.201s">I</a> was more concerned with the fact of how they are going to grade our kids, and how the accountability is going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2816.167s">I</a> just don't want to get penalized.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2819.77s">Okay,</a> so, all right, that's all I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2822.193s">I</a> just want to make sure that the kids do not get, and the schools, and the district does not get penalized because they've decided to change it.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4087.91s">She's</a> been there for a very long time and we definitely need her there, but.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4094.973s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4095.354s">And</a> that's the one closer to Myrtle. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4097.935s">It's,</a> it's about a, it's about a block and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4100.756s">Well,</a> no, Myrtle's over the hill actually, but Myrtle is closer to that than it is to the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4107.359s">Francis</a> one that they were talking about.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=481.112s">Bernadette,</a> do we know how much the 25% we're talking about, how much money we're talking?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=510.678s">I</a> know we just, I just wanted to ask, is there any way of discussing a future, like further down, like maybe, hopefully, maybe in the middle of the year or at the end of the year?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=563.638s">And</a> now that we've discussed it here, I mean, are parents going to be notified via mail, via telephone?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=603.388s">36.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=603.468s">Well,</a> I would hope that it would be a little bit more personal than just listening to it over in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=611.314s">So</a> I know it's hard because of time wise, but I would really appreciate that if something else could be done rather than just, I mean, there's two chaperones, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=620.141s">Two</a> chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=621.102s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=621.602s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=622.343s">So</a> maybe the list could be divided up and just a personal phone call real quick to those parents.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1447.791s">Okay,</a> when you say that you advise if they get it, is that something that's separate or is that something?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1455.837s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1456.478s">Could</a> we just look into that though because I just want to make sure that when we do these types of trips for our students, I think it's very beneficiary that we include. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1466.846s">I</a> know it costs a little bit more money, but it's very beneficial for us to make sure that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1472.387s">that</a> insurance, because I believe that insurance not only covers the cancellation of the trip, but it also incurs if by any chance, God forbid, there's any type of sickness or someone gets hurt or someone, and I think it's very beneficial that it is part of the package deal.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1518.169s">Just</a> a point of information, there are other opportunities out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1522.01s">I</a> know because I've looked them up that they're not as high as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1525.251s">So</a> it has to be researched a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1527.371s">I'm</a> not saying you, but I am saying that that is something, especially where these students are going and where the ones that are responsible for them, I really believe that that has to be part of the trip.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1752.975s">Mr.</a> Mayor, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1755.577s">I</a> just want to say, first of all, our condolences to Heidi and to her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1760.019s">But</a> also, I got a lot of feedback that night from people that had come up and toured the vocational school, and they were very, very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1770.406s">A</a> lot of parents that have students in eighth grade that came up to the open house, they were really impressed on how things have changed and the opportunities that the students are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1780.502s">So</a> I just want to take the time out to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1783.204s">Riccio,</a> to our staff, and to the school, because it has changed quite a bit in a very short time.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5540.18s">Well,</a> then there's conflict of stories, because there's also been stories that they have been stopped, and they were asked a question.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5550.224s">So</a> once they got in the building, they were asked a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5552.885s">If</a> they didn't know who that person was, you escort them to the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5558.006s">It's</a> absolutely what everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5559.807s">It's</a> been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5561.127s">We</a> can't change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5563.048s">We</a> thank God that nothing has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5566.425s">I</a> think we all are responsible for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5568.186s">I</a> mean, the other thing I'm looking at is the Fox media. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5573.828s">If</a> we're in a situation that, God forbid, this was about stealing, but let's say it was even higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5581.77s">And</a> we've been told by our police not to have anybody know because they're in the middle of this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5588.113s">I</a> don't believe in the time frame of it because it did happen on Friday and we didn't find out until Monday or Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5594.437s">But</a> what I'm trying to say is that if the police are in the middle of this and they are in the middle of an investigation and the media decides to leak it somewhere, isn't that jeopardizing us? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5604.822s">Isn't</a> there any type of repercussion on them? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5608.514s">I</a> mean, these are questions I'd like to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5611.437s">As</a> far as the ideas, I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5614.179s">I</a> mean, as far as, you know, Mr. Edwards, I know that you said it's difficult and all that, but the thing is that if a student forgets the first day, the second day, the third day, there has to be repercussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5624.488s">If</a> you're going to be doing something just like anything else, you don't bring your homework, you don't bring your homework into class, if you don't take a test, I mean, that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5633.035s">We're</a> here to teach these kids that <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5636.074s">You</a> just can't continue doing what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5639.096s">I</a> mean, I work at a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5640.417s">I</a> have an ID.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5644.5s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5645.24s">I'm</a> not saying it was his fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5646.902s">I'm</a> just saying, everybody has their opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5649.864s">I</a> just want to say that I agree with the IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5656.029s">And</a> as far as even the high school, a lot of the times I'm up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5660.673s">And</a> again, you can have all the protocols you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5662.875s">But</a> if you have certain groups that come in there and decide that they want to leave the door open because it's too hot in a room or because they're going in and out of their car to pick up something to bring it into a different room, I've gone and I've shut the door myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5676.968s">They've</a> gotten mad at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5678.77s">But</a> we can have all the protocols we want, but if people don't listen and they don't abide by them, then where does this stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5688.161s">Where</a> is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5689.223s">I</a> mean, this is what I'm trying to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5690.704s">I</a> mean, we could have all these laws and protocols, but if people within our own school system, and I'm not saying your school, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5697.372s">because</a> you have done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5699.234s">I've</a> been at the McGlynn, I was a parent at the McGlynn, and there were many times I couldn't even get into the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5704.718s">So</a> it has nothing to do with the McGlynn, it's just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5708.381s">We</a> have 37 doors at the high school, we have multi events that are going on, but at times there are also people that have events in our own school system within that if you ask them to abide by the protocol, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5723.507s">They</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5724.747s">And</a> then they'll say, you know, certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5727.629s">So,</a> I mean, they've been, they've been addressed, but we have to keep on addressing them.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Ma9HhZR7otw/2025-03-21_Ma9HhZR7otw.html">Medford School Committee - October 19, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1129.282s">Thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1131.063s">That</a> was really done very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1133.044s">I</a> do have a question around a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1136.285s">What</a> would the percentage of the funding be, do you know, when you say that you would be putting the application in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1144.547s">Would</a> they provide all of the funding for us?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1191.112s">Right,</a> that part I knew, that's why I was hoping that if we get the funding, they would cover for the rest of it and we wouldn't have any problem getting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1198.953s">The</a> other thing is the maintenance on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1201.634s">What</a> is your average cost on maintenance on something if we go ahead and do this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1258.977s">Okay,</a> and do you know if within the three years, the $20,000, let's say, in that particular situation would have to be used up, the $20,000 would have to be used up in each and every year, or is it something that you could roll over a little bit?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1284.96s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1285.761s">And</a> as far as the rules and regulations, would it be just like the regular rules of every park that we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1293.105s">You</a> know, we just put up the signs and everybody abides by, you know, the children to make sure that our children aren't going into the park if they're not being supervised and make sure that if we have people walking to the dog park, because there is a lot of children in those areas, that they'll be leashed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1311.135s">Because</a> I know we do have situations where sometimes, unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1314.36s">people</a> don't abide by the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1315.561s">So</a> I don't know if that's something that could be regulated a little bit more, if there's someone that we could have to regulate that a little bit more.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1397.522s">Looks</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1398.082s">Thank</a> you very much and thank you everyone for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1399.923s">It</a> looks really wacky.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4066.429s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4066.889s">Thank</a> you all for the wonderful and hard work that you've all put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4071.113s">I</a> was looking at, I guess the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4075.437s">agenda</a> of what's going on through the grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4080.421s">So</a> for me, this is where what comes from here and goes into the classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4087.886s">That's</a> the important part for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4089.887s">So</a> what do the grants do that go into the classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4092.409s">How</a> do we get what you're doing into the classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4095.331s">How</a> do we get what you're doing into homes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4099.934s">How</a> do we get everything that you're so enthusiastic and excited and had work? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4105.458s">has</a> put into this, how do we get it out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4107.839s">How</a> do we educate our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4109.079s">How</a> do we educate our parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4110.639s">How</a> do we get it out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4112.8s">And</a> these pamphlets and these booklets, they're wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4117.221s">But</a> I also know that as a parent, we get them at home, and they are very educational, but we're so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4123.623s">So</a> hands-on is what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4125.943s">And</a> these agendas that I'm looking through are really important, and that's what we need to get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4131.825s">And</a> I think it's important that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4133.878s">all</a> this work that you've all done is recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4138.22s">And</a> that, for me, is the really important part of this puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4142.163s">So</a> if you could go over this, I would really appreciate it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4240.897s">Okay,</a> so you've piloted at the McGlynn?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4246.64s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4263.788s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4264.609s">And</a> do you know when... Is it going to be this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4266.73s">Oh,</a> yes, this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4269.473s">I</a> mean, it's a lot of work, and I totally understand that, but it's not going to be successful if we don't get it into the classrooms, and it's not going to be successful if our parents don't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4281.438s">So</a> I guess the flip side of this is, what do you want the parents to do on the flip side of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4287.623s">I</a> mean, you're going to be teaching it in the classrooms, you're going to make it more aware to the students, but what is it as parents who want to put feedback into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4295.888s">What</a> are you expecting us to do?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4339.943s">That's</a> wonderful, and I guess I'm really looking to what is, technically I know it's not under our preview, but how do we connect what we're doing from K through 12, and then from 12, when our students leave? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4362.162s">Because</a> that's when we've seen our numbers all of a sudden get high. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4367.157s">And</a> we've seen the consequences of what's been happening with that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4520.567s">Yeah,</a> I know, and I'm very well aware that that's one particular group that's out there, and there are a few other groups that are out there, and that's why it's important that everybody work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4530.65s">And</a> I want to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4531.83s">I</a> mean, there is a certain point where it's not like we need to wash our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4535.791s">It's</a> just that I want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4537.612s">the</a> information is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4538.853s">We</a> cannot hold everyone's hand forever, but I just want to make sure that we have the information here and it is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4549.039s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5557.253s">I</a> just wanted to say, it kind of dragged my memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5561.396s">As</a> Mr. Scottelli was speaking about it, now I'll really end up letting you know how old I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5567.84s">Involved</a> with four boys in sports for over 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5575.675s">We</a> did, I remember like in youth soccer, we had these little pamphlets that were given out for different things during different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5584.919s">But</a> I remember like just at registration time or whatever, just little pamphlets, little things like with little bullet points in it that, as Mr. Scarpelli said and as I had said before, all this hard work that everyone is doing is wonderful, but unfortunately, like everyone's life, it's just very hard sometimes and unless it's <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5603.343s">Again,</a> unfortunately, in your own backyard, you really can't take the time or you don't take the time to really look at every single thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5609.885s">But</a> if you could pick up, you know, you're registering your child or whatever, and you pick up a little pamphlet, and you're like waiting in between kids picking up or whatever, and you're looking at all these things, and you look at the, you know, bullet points, you know, just like stereo, people have stereotypes in their mind of what a child who commits suicide is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5632.635s">I</a> know that the state already has a lot of things that are what the stereotype isn't, and to educate people in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5640.48s">So</a> just little things like that is, I guess, what we're asking for.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5647.545s">Right,</a> I used to get them.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8810.281s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8811.702s">When</a> Mr. Benedetto had asked about the program being in the black, are you talking about the summer fund program, or are you talking about the summer school program? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8821.429s">Summer</a> school.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8918.739s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6xIhPJ6iVjI/2025-03-21_6xIhPJ6iVjI.html">Medford School Committee - June 15, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=311.989s">Mr.</a> Mann.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=315.158s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=315.818s">Thank</a> you for all the hard work, because I know this was not done in a very short time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=319.599s">I</a> know that it's been months and months of your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=323.439s">And</a> I know that you and a lot of people are very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=326.28s">We</a> were very excited to hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=330.261s">I'd</a> like to know the take of, one, the student's enthusiasm when he was speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=336.622s">And</a> also, what did he say about the facility itself?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=407.387s">I</a> would love to see a piece of this on our newspapers, on our Facebook page, on our own website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=416.023s">I</a> think this was an amazing day for a lot of students that were involved, but it was definitely something that I believe our community definitely needs to know about.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1232.129s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1234.503s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1235.444s">I</a> totally appreciate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1236.764s">And</a> just to continue on with what Mr. Falco was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1240.947s">So</a> the capability of this, first of all, we have, you were saying that it's very user friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1247.451s">So</a> for parents and students, I'm going to throw out here, maybe throw you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1256.505s">Am</a> I understanding correctly then that all elementary, middle, high school, Curtis Tufts teachers will be using this so parents could get information and students could get information from this?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1306.424s">And</a> this program then will encompass everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1310.706s">It's</a> like from the health, from administration, from parents to students, from homework to grades to everything.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1327.895s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1328.275s">And</a> I also, I also know that at the beginning, especially, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1331.717s">I</a> passed, it was really difficult for parents sometimes to actually, you know, link in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1338.703s">It</a> was like it would take days sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1340.644s">I</a> know it got better, but I'm hoping that this would be easier for parents to get, to link on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1346.489s">Is</a> that what I'm understanding?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1855.26s">Mr.</a> Mayor?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1957.863s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1960.264s">Thank</a> you, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1961.965s">Just</a> to go over, on the expectations, it says all proposals must maintain most buildings work well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1969.603s">Could</a> you reiterate that for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1972.865s">When</a> it says most buildings work well, we're hoping that all our buildings work well.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2018.807s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2019.407s">So</a> when you were talking about that, you were talking about the intercom system within the school system, not parents or other people calling the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2028.332s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2028.938s">So</a> that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2029.819s">Not</a> that I'm happy about that, but at least I'm more concerned with parents trying to get in touch with administration and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2036.704s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2038.385s">So</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2040.447s">The</a> family network, the daycare, is that all inclusive with what we're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2046.391s">Or</a> are those separate forms?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2053.416s">And</a> I guess that was? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2056.833s">basically.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2057.373s">Oh,</a> um, I know, I don't know if this is part of it, but I do know that, um, a lot of the secretaries, a lot of the time have also said it would be nice if we could have like, um, when they go to answer the phone, they know exactly who's calling.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3238.731s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3242.0s">I</a> don't think there's anyone here who disagrees with both of what my colleagues have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3246.582s">I</a> mean, you know, we're, we're all compassionate and that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3250.523s">I</a> mean, we all know why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3254.145s">We're</a> definitely here for the kids, but if we also have to look at our regulations and what we have to comply with, we also, that is also our responsibility of why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3263.788s">So</a> I'm looking at the three proposals and the way I'm looking at it is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3268.35s">I've</a> looked at the second and the third, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3271.763s">And</a> the second and the third, the differences are right now, we're looking at the breakfast day is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3279.786s">As</a> far as it's a dollar now, it goes up to a dollar 10 with the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3284.608s">The</a> lunch, the elementary, we're talking a 10 cent difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3290.87s">The</a> middle school and the high school, the lunch we're talking a five cent difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3296.992s">If</a> we combine those two, the second and the third proposal, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3300.778s">But</a> the caveat, no pun intended, is that we look at those numbers, but now we're saying that if we <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3309.937s">as</a> a committee decide that we're going to go with those two proposals, but then we're going to look at it next year and say that we're going to be bringing up the rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3318.124s">It's</a> something that I definitely don't want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3320.466s">I</a> mean, personally, I don't want to do any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3323.329s">But</a> if I have to look at logistically, I'm looking at the fact that we haven't touched this in approximately 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3333.018s">Not</a> looking at the breakfast portion of proposal number one, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3338.28s">The</a> difference between an elementary lunch at $2.75 and the proposal of $2.01, we're talking a $0.05 difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3347.983s">The</a> difference between the middle school lunch and the high school lunch, we're talking a $0.10 difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3357.065s">Again,</a> I'm just throwing out the numbers to really break them down in what we're talking and what we're discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3363.046s">What</a> I do have a problem with, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3365.276s">As</a> I mentioned before, I have a problem with the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3368.257s">But</a> we're going from a breakfast of $1 to $1.50. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3370.558s">A</a> $0.50 jump is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3375.241s">And</a> that's a $0.40 difference between number one proposal and the two and the third. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3382.484s">So</a> I'm looking at it <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3385.701s">Would</a> it still be beneficial if there's some room to work out the breakfast of a dollar if we're looking at this as a committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3393.806s">And</a> again, these are just numbers to throw out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3396.227s">I'm</a> not speaking for anyone else, but I am saying a 50 cent jump is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3403.463s">Is</a> there any way to work that breakfast from $1 to like, I don't know, $1.20, $1.30, something like that, and still not touch this for a few years down the road?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3425.845s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3427.173s">I</a> just want, you know, I want to do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3428.893s">I</a> want to do the right thing for both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3430.654s">I</a> want, you know, I want to do the due diligence of making sure that we're in compliance, but I also want to make sure that our children are all being fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3441.056s">And,</a> you know, as our, as my colleague said, I mean, we understand that the free and reduced lunch children are going to be covered, but we don't want to take advantage of the person who's going out there working day after day and they're going from paycheck to paycheck either. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3456.246s">It's</a> hard on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3457.927s">So</a> that was what I was throwing out there.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3870.91s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3873.252s">I</a> just want to keep in mind that one thing that has come up in discussion is this is a self-sustaining program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3883.693s">And</a> if we have equipment that is not going to work properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3888.155s">And</a> I don't want to see this department come to us in a year, two years and say, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3895.498s">It's</a> going downhill now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3897.979s">And</a> then in two years, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3899.919s">We're</a> not going to be able to feed the students because it's completely broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3904.881s">I</a> don't like to see our prices go up, but we haven't gotten, we haven't raised any prices in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3911.524s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3912.715s">I</a> like to keep my budget at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3914.456s">I</a> have four kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3916.457s">And</a> if something breaks, I'd rather have—gee, I'll put $2 aside every week, and that way at least I know if, God forbid, anything happens, I have that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3927.222s">To</a> say that I'm going to go to the minimum now, and then all of a sudden next year we're to the minimum, and next year we're to the minimum, that's why we're sitting here now saying, gee, maybe we should have put that money aside for the last 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3940.463s">So</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3943.064s">I</a> don't want to go up and overcharge anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3946.826s">My</a> concern is that we've been sitting here for a few amount of years now, going back to the pool and the fields and the theater, saying, we're going to maintain, we're going to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3959.753s">This</a> is a self-sustaining program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3962.375s">It's</a> been doing very well for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3966.097s">I</a> do not want any child <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3968.398s">to</a> not eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3970.059s">But</a> I don't want to see the day that we're going to turn around and say, we're going to have to close this cafeteria, or we're going to have to close that cafeteria, because we have no money for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3980.745s">That's</a> my concern.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4014.054s">So</a> if it means charging a fine- Mr. Mayor, I'd rather- Mrs. DiBenedetto.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4518.972s">But</a> point of clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4522.394s">I</a> have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4522.994s">I</a> just want to have the clarification on proposal number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4527.355s">Does</a> that also, is this one here also the one that we would have to come back to next year that we would have to increase?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_suH7AXXbrvY/2025-03-21_suH7AXXbrvY.html">Medford School Committee - May 4, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=67.859s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=446.593s">Basically,</a> everything that my colleague has said. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=449.077s">I</a> just want to congratulate everyone I do know. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=451.947s">Dr.</a> Perrella, as you mentioned, there's a lot of people behind you, and it could only be as successful as the hard work that everybody put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=459.074s">And</a> I do know that there were a lot of people involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=461.837s">And</a> as a parent, we're always trying to push and bring the level of the bar always higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=468.824s">But</a> one thing as a parent I really feel good about is knowing that my children will go to a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=475.51s">and</a> really have that atmosphere of, you know, they could go speak to someone and it's a great atmosphere to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=482.9s">And</a> so I thank all of you for all your work and for everyone else who was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=487.065s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=677.624s">I</a> was just going to say, I mean, the day, I know it already happened, but I don't know if there's another day that's coming up, but usually the kids will have like a spirit day or a fun day or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=694.725s">While</a> all the students are in that atmosphere, maybe we could have something a little bit special for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=700.773s">Just</a> to throw it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=701.954s">But</a> I also want to say, I just want to piggyback on what George mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=706.38s">And</a> I have to say that this year it's been really a lot of fun already. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=710.906s">Going</a> out and listening to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=713.128s">that</a> usually I'll have parents say to me, what are you going to do with that vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=717.67s">You</a> know all these students are going here, and we're going to lose them here, and why don't you try this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=723.632s">And</a> I can honestly tell you, I was out a lot this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=726.833s">And</a> it was really nice to hear parents say, you know, my son's going to the Volk, or my daughter's going to the Volk, and they're freshmen this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=734.796s">And</a> I had no idea how wonderful it is and how things are moving, because you have all these rumors out there of, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=742.499s">You</a> know, we're trying to destroy the vocational, or we're trying to get rid of the vocational, and they're finally, everyone is finally understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=750.122s">We're</a> not trying to get rid of anything, but really to make it better, and to give the students the best opportunity possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=756.644s">So,</a> when I throw in now that, you know, our vocational students are taking languages, rather than taking night courses at night, because a lot of them go off to colleges, people are like, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=766.607s">standing</a> back now saying, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=768.048s">I</a> didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=769.388s">So</a> again, this is all the hard work that, as my colleague Erin had said, it's years of building, but it's finally coming together, and I couldn't be prouder, so thank you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1128.833s">Oh,</a> we'll approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1129.713s">We'll</a> approve it.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1141.639s">I</a> just want to say thank you, and also if we could send a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1145.44s">Okay,</a> a letter of thanking. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1147.621s">And</a> there was one more thing I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1150.441s">To</a> Mr. Nascimento, not only do I want to say thank you to you for being the high school football coach, and the team has done a great job, and I don't think I'll forget the last Thanksgiving game ever, but I also want to commend you on <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1165.045s">the</a> academic side of what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1166.989s">You've</a> done a terrific job and I hear the students all the time speaking about coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1172.26s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you to you on that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1396.79s">I</a> would like I don't know if that was true or not, but it is so true.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1612.869s">Just</a> basically, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1614.81s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1616.291s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1617.953s">This</a> has been something that we've been pushing for for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1621.816s">I</a> am totally excited about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1624.058s">It's</a> been a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1626.901s">And</a> the way it's presented, the way it's set up, I can't really express how happy I am about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1634.128s">I</a> will ask, I know that this is for after school, more at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1640.053s">Just</a> again, I know we've had the discussion of maybe something in the summer for maybe students that might be interested, or even something during the school year, like after school, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1651.181s">Totally</a> understandable that this was never, I know that when we brought it up in the past, it was never to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1658.005s">It</a> was really to get a foundation started up to bring more eyes and ears to the vocational side of our school, to give all students the opportunity to see what we were offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1669.388s">And</a> I really commend you all and all the teachers that were involved in this because this is a long time coming and I can't be more happier than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1678.231s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2168.034s">No,</a> I'm all set, thank you.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2782.361s">I</a> echo what everyone else has said tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2784.722s">First</a> of all, Mr. Cormier. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2786.522s">Thank</a> God that you are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2787.842s">I</a> know when you had told us a year and a half ago, it was devastating, you know, and the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2792.984s">But</a> you're here, and sometimes, you know, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2796.905s">I</a> mean, this was such a wonderful thing that Hunter has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2801.846s">Hunter,</a> like Mr. Scarpelli, you know, and everybody else, he is a clean cut, articulate, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2810.658s">Nice</a> kid in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2812.7s">He's</a> a vocational high school student. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2815.862s">I</a> can't be any prouder. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2817.483s">And</a> your parents must be beaming, because you have no idea how you have changed the stereotypical vocational student tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2829.071s">And</a> you've made us extremely proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2830.973s">And</a> as I said, and I know we've talked about it so many times, there are so many wonderful stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2837.057s">And</a> yours tonight is just the topper. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2840.059s">And</a> these are the stories that need to go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2842.44s">These</a> are the stories that our community and everyone else around us have to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2846.502s">Because</a> I am so tired of hearing about the bad kid or the bad person or something horrible happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2853.065s">And</a> we have so many jewels in this city that put us to shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2858.447s">And</a> you guys are the ones that are really the ones that are shining. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2861.329s">So</a> we really need to make these kids shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2863.97s">And</a> we really need to promote that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3034.486s">I'm</a> amazed at his presence.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3705.705s">I</a> just wanted to ask, I know that there are also students that will come and they've got their money or they don't have their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3715.691s">By</a> law, we still need to feed these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3718.133s">And</a> I know that in the past, cafeteria workers have taken their name down and they kind of keep a tally. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3726.758s">of</a> how much they owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3728.059s">Some</a> children come back to school with the money, some children don't come back to school with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3732.78s">I'd</a> like to find out if possible, like, if they're children that really should be on the free and reduced, but maybe because we haven't caught, you know, we haven't received an application, or we're not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3745.925s">And</a> we have those students that are repeating themselves daily, but belong on the free and reduced lunch plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3752.788s">maybe</a> that's also a different way of seeing some money come back in because if they're not applying and they really are supposed to be on that, we're losing some money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3763.09s">And</a> because I remember like when I was in the cafeterias and stuff in the past, as I said, you know, students would forget or they wouldn't have the money on them and some would come back and some wouldn't, but I always used to wonder like, how much money are we not getting back? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3776.874s">So,</a> and is it, you know, is it from a student who can't afford it or is it from a student who <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3782.975s">the</a> application number went through. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3784.376s">So</a> if there's some way of trying to figure that out too. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3787.057s">Right,</a> and I think that Jill Bradley would have the answers for that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5506.652s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5507.633s">Just</a> to go back to the goals of raising 3%, are we going to <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5519.127s">provide</a> maybe more tutoring after school next year for students? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5525.189s">I</a> mean, not only stay after their particular teacher, but actual programs after school that students could take, not necessarily just students that are not doing well in math, but in general?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5614.875s">What</a> about if, I mean, I haven't gotten a statistic or anything, but I do hear parents say that sometimes they've taken their middle school students to a private tutor. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5626.319s">So</a> I was just thinking, is it possible maybe to do something in the middle school, target middle school students that parents are willing to pay, but instead of going all over the place, dropping off, picking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5638.924s">I</a> know we utilize the students at Tufts University, and we have a great program there. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5643.806s">But</a> I also do know that parents are willing to pay for tutors, but I don't know if we ever offer those types of services.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5729.634s">Well,</a> like I said, it's not necessarily just for always targeting the MCAS.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5733.157s">It's</a> just to get more information on the mathematics itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5738.981s">But</a> you brought up a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5741.587s">I</a> mean, I know that, I'm not just saying Medford teachers, but I know teachers in general, no matter what city you work, some teachers have part-time jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5749.15s">So</a> are you saying that if a teacher in Medford has a Medford, not necessarily their student, but has a Medford student, and they're tutoring like after school or something, that's conflict of interest?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5775.18s">But</a> it's OK for them to do it, let's say, for a student that's outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5778.762s">That</a> would be better? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5779.703s">Yeah,</a> because then I'd pull the check. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5781.904s">I</a> was just curious in the conflict of interest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5784.085s">I</a> hadn't heard that one before. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5785.886s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5789.167s">Any</a> other questions?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7185.05s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7189.559s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7190.319s">Thank</a> you, Rachel, for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7191.879s">It's</a> really thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7194.0s">Just</a> a couple of questions, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7195.26s">When</a> you said you capped your classes at 30, I was just curious in knowing, is the contractual, are we going against any contractual numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7203.442s">Because</a> I know at the high school level for teachers, it's no more than 23 to 25.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7213.645s">And</a> Rachel, how many classes are you teaching during the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7217.086s">I</a> have three to four a day, depending on the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7219.868s">Three</a> to four? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7223.01s">And</a> they're all at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7224.491s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7226.453s">And</a> you had mentioned, you know, that one of the goals is 2016, hopefully we could use the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7232.957s">I</a> was wondering if we could look into maybe some type of intro to lifeguard certification or, I know that's a long <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7243.404s">but</a> some type of like introduction as you were mentioning before. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7247.045s">I</a> love your idea about having students maybe come and help out and introduce them to like sports medicine and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7257.53s">looking</a> at colleges lately, not for one, but for two. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7261.093s">And</a> sports medicine has increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7264.335s">I</a> mean, I can't get over the amount of students now that are looking for sports medicine or, oh my gosh, I just went blank and that's all I've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7274.742s">Sports</a> medicine, what was the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7277.164s">Sports</a> management and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7279.185s">So</a> I love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7280.266s">And</a> also, the Michigan Model Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7284.342s">When</a> parents have like open house, has anybody explained the Michigan model health to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7290.646s">Is</a> there any presentation to parents of what it actually encompasses? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7294.207s">I</a> mean, I know you've spoke about it here, you spoke about it the other night when we had the meeting of the whole, but I was just curious in knowing when we have open houses, do any of the principals speak about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7305.513s">Does</a> anybody talk about what we're offering?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7322.097s">I</a> love the ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7322.917s">I</a> love the idea of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7326.958s">I</a> just love the inspiration of new eyes, new ears, and new programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7332.139s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7333.36s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7334.04s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7433.673s">I</a> had one more question, and that was, you have down here that you'd like to improve the middle school schedule to afford all students the same amount of time in physical education and health. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7443.598s">Could</a> you elaborate a little bit more on that?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7465.649s">Okay,</a> so it's not necessarily then, because I've heard in the past, you know, well, if you're selecting an instrument, then you lose out on the Phys Ed, but you're not saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7474.651s">You're</a> saying that it's more because of a 0.5 teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7478.072s">That's</a> what we're saying for health and Phys Ed, yes.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7592.149s">I</a> just thought about the pool again. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7593.769s">The</a> pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7594.35s">If</a> students are taking swimming, is there a proper bathing suit that we're asking students to be wearing?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7624.145s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8493.565s">Thank</a> you, Leslie, for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8496.106s">I'm</a> looking at your pie chart, the one from Massachusetts and the one from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8501.517s">Because</a> English is not on these pies at all, I'm assuming that these pies are just based on ELL students, correct?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9089.018s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9089.398s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9092.78s">They</a> will still have the same type of curriculum because they'll be using the field.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9216.46s">Just</a> a point of information again, I know that in the past years because the, you know, our summers have had a lot of days that it's been raining, students do lose out on actually taking advantage of going out because they can't go out in the rain. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9231.366s">So,</a> sorry, but they can't not only go out in the rain, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9235.63s">to</a> the park but they can't get to the pool either because it is, you know, it is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9240.476s">Whereas</a> we have the indoor pool and it's better so that way they're not getting sunburned if we, you know, if it's really hot and they're not losing out on the activity because of the weather.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9548.547s">What</a> my colleagues have said is absolutely, I mean, true. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9554.905s">The</a> summertime program was something that, it was like a baby when I first started, and I know myself and Brianna Longo and George, but no matter what programs we bring, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9568.839s">forward,</a> if it's not for the people that are actually working in those programs, they would never be as successful as they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9576.129s">And</a> it is very important to know, you know, when you have Teacher of the Year or you have different opportunities, it's just wonderful to know that when they have those opportunities and they are going to the conferences, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9587.323s">you</a> bring Medford to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9589.644s">And</a> there's a difference of just talking about it than rather than just sitting at the table and representing your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9597.187s">And</a> again, to Anthony and to everyone for that particular program, it was near and dear to my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9604.77s">So</a> not that the other ones aren't, but this one here, I rolled up my sleeves and walked. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9612.413s">it's</a> been very, very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9614.354s">And</a> again, like talking about the programs that Heidi was talking about tonight, those were the piggyback programs that we were talking about because we had seen how successful these were. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9625.437s">We</a> have seen what the community is asking for and what we really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9630.098s">And</a> I'm hoping that these programs that we have, we've added a couple this year, and I'm hoping that by next year we'll add even more because it is something that our community is looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9641.482s">And</a> again, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9642.382s">Our</a> community is not asking for everything to be free, but affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9646.445s">And</a> if we could provide those programs, especially in the summertime, and we have a place for our students to go, there's nothing better than that.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9794.709s">Okay,</a> we'll do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9796.691s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10017.945s">May</a> 7th is National Honor Society.

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10115.494s">So</a> what do you have for the 27th?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10119.176s">Did</a> you say the 27th also?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=10189.328s">Are</a> we meeting, all the meetings as a whole, are we all starting that at 7 o'clock?

 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1145.498s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1145.698s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1147.959s">Actually,</a> the first two questions were the ones that Aaron just asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1152.101s">We</a> just want a breakdown of the full times and the part time and how much it would cost to have full time across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1159.023s">I</a> do want to say, looking at the numbers, I know that we like to look at certain things and make sure that we keep them the way we are, but I have to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1168.864s">When</a> I'm looking at these numbers in classrooms, they are incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1172.926s">I</a> just came off of a conference talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1176.008s">And</a> if I had shown them this, they would have been so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1181.511s">But</a> again, as Erin mentioned, having the 23 students in a classroom, especially with the younger students, it is something that we really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1190.076s">And</a> I know that you mentioned we would have maybe a meeting of the whole on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1194.918s">But</a> the other thing I am looking at is the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1198.281s">And</a> I'm looking at the middle school right now, and there is a difference of about 30 students, and they keep on climbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1208.416s">So</a> again, I know that I've brought this concern up in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1213.223s">But</a> I'd like to make sure that we also look at it for the year coming when September rolls around. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1218.885s">If</a> the numbers are going to be jumping up again towards one school rather than another school, I just don't want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1225.748s">I'd</a> like to see it equal across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1227.869s">I</a> know that one of the schools does have the inclusion classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1233.811s">Well,</a> no, both schools have. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1235.112s">Both</a> have inclusions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1236.713s">So</a> I just want to keep our eyes opened on, especially the middle schools, because I do see those numbers going up.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2188.6s">Madam</a> chair.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2271.313s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2272.954s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2274.375s">First</a> of all, do we have any idea when the principals are going to be doing their forums? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2279.739s">Do</a> we have any dates or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2281.46s">Will</a> it be at night or will it be during the day?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2358.518s">You</a> know, I know Mr. Van der Kloot just mentioned the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2362.7s">I</a> sat on this committee for two years, going back and forth with the Department of Education, and it is very frustrating because, you know, again, I think they think we're fools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2375.486s">Unfortunately,</a> you know, I hate the idea that we're using our children's education for politics, but there's a lot of political background to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2385.931s">I</a> know that there's a huge, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2388.23s">I</a> shouldn't say huge, but there are organizations out there that are trying to focus on maybe not having this, but I'd like to know how many students do opt out when we get the response from this letter.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2414.107s">half</a> the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2415.828s">But</a> I think you have to check into the fact that we by law would have to also send out a letter asking parents if they want to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2424.771s">Please</a> double check in that because I know that when we did it last year with the park and the MCAS.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2494.138s">No,</a> and I want to make sure that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2495.639s">And</a> that's the reason I think that we voted for this the way we did a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2499.782s">But</a> I do want for, you know, if through you to the superintendent, if you could find out about this letter, because I don't want to find out that there are cities out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2508.767s">I</a> totally agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2510.268s">I</a> understand because, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2512.643s">We</a> want to give the best we possibly can to our students, but I don't want to find out from other districts that there might be such a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2521.406s">And</a> if there is, we need to know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2524.767s">I</a> don't recommend that, even though I don't like the standardized testing, I don't recommend that we do have parents sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2532.191s">It</a> is their choice, but I want to make sure that if that choice is there, we have to be transparent in letting them know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2539.974s">We'll</a> look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2540.554s">Can</a> we just double check, please?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4000.33s">Did</a> you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4001.111s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4003.492s">I</a> know that we just went over the numbers at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4007.754s">What</a> about the middle school?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4022.423s">How</a> many classes is that divided into?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4059.258s">And</a> out of the 54, do you know what the numbers are in the first, second and third level?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4078.53s">And</a> going back to the high school, the 22, are we talking, they're all 22 in one class, correct?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4152.813s">So</a> when you're saying that we have 22 students in one level, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4157.292s">Are</a> you talking about level one?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4159.694s">Okay,</a> so you definitely have the 22 students in level one?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4165.198s">Okay,</a> and what about two, three, and four, do you know those?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4181.142s">And</a> I know it's difficult because of the mobilization with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4185.185s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4185.805s">And</a> as the superintendent said, he mentioned something about certain parts of the year, certain students leave, and then they come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4194.072s">Do</a> we know what the trend, like these 22 students that we have in level one, have they been with us for the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4200.056s">Have</a> they started last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4202.037s">What</a> is the trend?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4215.813s">And</a> do you see the trend in this particular group that come down another two months or so, all of a sudden from 22 students, we're going to go down to 10?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4232.036s">And</a> I respect the fact that ESI numbers are good, but 22 students in a class with how many teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4243.467s">One.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4244.347s">One</a> teacher.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4255.001s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4255.301s">It's</a> very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4256.201s">And</a> I know that these numbers do change. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4257.961s">I</a> know that because of the mobilization, we go in and out, but I also do know that over the last couple of years, we've had a lot of students come stay with us and the mobilization really hasn't changed in this particular level. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4270.846s">I</a> do recommend that we do look at this particular level. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4274.468s">Maybe</a> we could look at, I don't know, at least, you know, if we can't find the money for breaking this particular level up even into two classes, but at least some type of assistance in that class. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4286.252s">Because</a> I mean, you know, we brought up the kindergartners a little while ago that 23 students in a class, it's difficult to tie shoes and, you know, put on coats and try to teach them. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4296.476s">But</a> on the flip side of this, try to be a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4299.338s">try</a> to teach 22 students that are, you know, at a different language level. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4305.628s">That</a> teacher needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4309.743s">the</a> mayor through to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4312.124s">If</a> there's something that, I mean, I know that we're going to be looking at this at budget time, but in the meantime, budget time doesn't come until me, uh, for, you know, the discussion of budget doesn't come until we really sit down later on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4325.526s">And</a> if these numbers, especially are going to be rising, it's something that we definitely have to look at.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4334.908s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4436.779s">I</a> was just going to ask before you even start. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4438.639s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4439.9s">I</a> know that we have the changes, but do we have anything that we would see what the changes are like from what they were to what they are? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4449.06s">from</a> what we had prior?
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4491.191s">No,</a> you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4492.112s">That</a> was the only thing I was going to ask.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4939.271s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5950.956s">Aye.</a>
