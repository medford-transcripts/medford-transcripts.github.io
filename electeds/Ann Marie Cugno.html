    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3872.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3873.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3877.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3886.608s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3894.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But let's call this what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3896.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3901.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, this is not a gender issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3905.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a power issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3908.039s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3921.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3943.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3948.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: $25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3953.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3959.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3975.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3986.109s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're also the same people that said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3990.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3997.832s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4004.859s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4007.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4038.092s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: opportunity to speak what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4061.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4071.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would definitely want to be there but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4074.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4077.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4084.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4088.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4095.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1974.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh yeah, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5569.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5574.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5575.316s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5588.348s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5603.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5611.289s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: your agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5624.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're here for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5627.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5634.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5647.393s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5659.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's try the healing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5661.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5664.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think that what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5666.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sutton represents is tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5669.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5677.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but we need someone to also represent the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5681.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a connection with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5683.372s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5684.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: She walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5686.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The children know that she walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5689.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: She was the smiling face that they saw every morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5693.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5702.196s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5711.18s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5716.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5723.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8345.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, yep, I'm all set, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8349.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually have a couple of questions here, and that is, there's been discussion on two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8356.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is family engagement, and that is how to get your address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8362.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, I'm so sorry, Emery Cugno 871 Felsway Medford mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, you're welcome and I should have known better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8369.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8370.444s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, there were two things that people are talking about and that is one is family engagement and the other one is child engagement, family engagement is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8379.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying one is more important than the other, but I totally understand the engagement that a person has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8385.414s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're only dealing with one teacher most of the time when you're K through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8390.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Once they go to middle school, then there's teams of teachers and high school is the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8395.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a very important issue that I know that there was communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8400.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we had certain apps that we were working with, software programs that we were working with in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8405.861s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if they're still up and going, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8410.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's, as a person listening to this meeting, as a parent, I would get, it seems a little bit nerve wracking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8419.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I do know that if anyone has ever, I mean, I was on the school committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8425.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't remember anybody telling me they couldn't get in touch with their child for an emergency or because their buses had to get switched that day or because someone else was picking them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8436.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They always called<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8437.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the school and the school, whether it be the principal, headmaster, assistant principals, the information always got to the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8448.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't want parents out there thinking that if they don't have iPhones, if they don't have certain, you know, things to connect directly with the child, that they're never going to be able to get a message to their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8463.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that before we open up any more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8468.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Russo said something about pornography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8472.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a school committee member, I think that would be a huge issue that should be discussed and taken care of before emails and more emails are put on our sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8486.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, if people are saying that their children are seeing pornography that's coming to us, or, I mean, please specify and clarify what's going on, because I think it's important that before anybody else adds more onto our service,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8500.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: um, that that really needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9748.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9755.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How did I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9789.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9790.265s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9792.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have to re-say my name and address again, for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9796.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 871-FELSA, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9797.545s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Guzman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9798.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9799.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would just ask that there are protocols and there's policies, but there's also common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9808.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're offering to do a meeting both in person and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9812.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not like you're taking away the possibility of people still watching on Zoom, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9819.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The people in the city, they've been asking and they're all, we all want an in-person meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9827.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not only speaking for myself, I'm speaking for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9832.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to have that opportunity to come in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9837.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some people feel comfortable on Zoom, some people feel comfortable in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9842.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9843.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it's time for people to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9846.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know there's a motion on there saying that maybe you'll wait for your policies and protocols to be looked at and reviewed, but that might even take until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9859.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9861.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Gray mentioned something about September, so I just wanna make sure that we clarify that you guys aren't waiting until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6242.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Emery cuneo at 71 Felsway Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6245.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I wasn't able to come down tonight and I had no intention actually of speaking, however, watching this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6254.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have to say how disheartening I am, not with not with the with the city council but in general, what's going on in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6264.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6266.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6267.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The first thing I really challenged myself and making sure that we'd work on is bullying and the bullying one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6276.867s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the internet, and we had many forums with many people, whether it be students or adults, police chief, police, we had experts from Bridgewater, and really felt better about those, those, not those rallies, those conferences with everybody and those meetings with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6300.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I have to say, I feel like we've gone backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6303.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not the children that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6305.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is the adults that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6309.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, we're the models for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6314.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So what we do, what we say, how we say it, how we act, how we attack people on Facebook or any type of social media, it's something that our kids see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6328.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, I don't plan on speaking on a lot of the things that everybody else has touched upon, but I will speak on a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6336.251s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is one, Gene Barry, Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6341.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether or not you know this person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6345.493s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: which I did and I respected and I still respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6349.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now knowing her rest of the family still have the respect for, but that doesn't make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6356.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The difference is, is that you have a person who has family in the city, who has given a lot to this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6364.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one has the right to speak and throw things out about someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6370.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What kills me is the fact that people that are writing are the ones that are saying we shouldn't act like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6379.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, with that being said, as an Italian, so far now, I've been called a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6388.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been called other names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6391.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Growing up in this city changed a lot of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6396.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: because we became evolved and like we expected to respect everyone, we don't pick and choose which nationality we are going to respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6409.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We respect all nationalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6412.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From an Italian who was bullied when she was in school, where my name was changed because I was an Italian, and over the years finally get respect that we are all being treated equally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6426.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6429.111s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now to hear that if I'm Italian, I need to be quiet or I am now accused as a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6435.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would love to know that if I wrote something like that about someone else from a different type of culture or a different nationality or a different group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6447.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it would've been just thrown under the rug, shoved under the rug, and hey, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6454.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we are going to advocate for diversity, and if we are going to advocate for fairness in this city, it has to start with all nationalities, all cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6471.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6473.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Heard something a few weeks ago, and I know but I think that I'm crazy but The thing that I heard was actually on It was on the Oscars and it was from Mr. Perry who received a humanitarian award and what I loved about what he said, and I truly believe this is that he said<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6499.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We, in our hearts, do not have room for hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6505.757s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We do not have room for hate for Asians, or blacks, or whites, or police officers, or anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6515.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to come to a middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6518.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I believe there's someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6520.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know why I have someone else on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6525.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What we need to do is we need to get the city down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6529.218s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not in the things of what we believe or who believes, but back in the middle to understand what the city's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6539.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm sorry, but I can't see the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6541.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually see someone else on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6545.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what I'm trying to say is we need to come to the middle, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6551.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying because you're here so many years that you have a right to speak above someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6557.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What we're saying is let's talk together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6561.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it seems to me that the groups that are coming in contradict each other because they're treating each other like the ones that they're accusing other groups of being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6572.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6574.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now the latest I heard is for certain people that want to make sure that we, as when we present ourselves at a podium, are not supposed to say that we're lifelong citizens or residents of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6587.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6589.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6591.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have grown up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6592.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have chose to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6595.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have chosen to keep my children and raise my children here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6599.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not a disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6600.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not a leprosy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6602.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6603.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I want to be proud of I am an Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6607.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And yes, I am proud to say that I come from Fredford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6611.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I am not proud of where method is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you hear me now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Man, you can hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I do understand where everyone is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One was from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mostone and the other one is from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my standpoint is that with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: two, three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: precedence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's coming, that should have already been started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the discussion is already should have already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not aware if it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of people go on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3822.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: hold on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3847.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3867.934s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3876.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it wasn't open to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3879.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3880.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3886.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3891.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3903.259s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3921.761s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3933.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The fact remains is who's going to be interviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3938.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the people that apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3940.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who is selecting the applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3943.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen the application before it goes out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3946.657s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3952.843s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3953.703s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I have had a lot of questions of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3957.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: not to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3966.634s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3972.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that is, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6925.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6926.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just getting it ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6932.286s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6936.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I asked a few questions before, and that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6940.211s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6950.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6955.456s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6961.358s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6965.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6970.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, we're talking the priority of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6975.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there are people right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6977.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: on the committee that feel that the name should be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6981.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6996.393s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The change is going to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6997.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't understand why that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7000.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second of all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7002.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7008.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7019.054s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Being involved in the system, I know how much time it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7024.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7029.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How much time is gonna be put into it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7031.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7036.047s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How are you going to put everyone on the same schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7042.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: More importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7052.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7060.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9427.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so if I'm understanding this the correct way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9433.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to take a round of questions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9436.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're going to go and work on the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9439.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then once it's done and you're all finished, you're going to come back to take more questions from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9448.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we're after 8 o'clock now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9450.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we're going to expect you to come back at 10, 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9454.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9456.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second of all is the fact that, you know, everybody keeps on saying everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9461.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think everybody forgets the fact that if everybody had been heard in June, you would have had your 600 signatures against the, I don't want to say against, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9474.375s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: versus the 300 signatures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9476.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my question again, isn't this a mute conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9482.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because everybody keeps on saying that everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9486.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And these questions and concerns from the community started when we finally did hear about what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9494.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, it's just frustrating because I've asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9498.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There have been other people tonight that have asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9501.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And out of respect, it would be nice if we got some type of answer because you still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9508.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't know any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9511.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the comment on process and policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9515.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member, we had many processes and policies, we just didn't throw this up and say in one night, we're going to do this, whether people you know agree or disagree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9527.828s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think that the process, again, you're going to have people against him for this, but this is a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9535.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: community has been speaking, and it seems like tonight that people are asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9540.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There still has not been one person who has stood up and answered any of them or addressed any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9547.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on June 30th, or whatever the day was, those answers to those questions were all answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9556.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee, you're supposed to be representing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9561.527s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Anne-Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9563.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16325.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16327.106s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16328.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Basically, again, we're still at the same position we were four hours ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16333.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have a committee who keeps on telling me that it's not gonna take any time, it doesn't take time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16338.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16340.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to open up our schools to all our elementary schools have to be open in three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16346.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't understand this process this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16349.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And honestly, the members keep on saying that they hear people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16353.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I've been listening to people all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16355.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but no one has addressed the situation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16358.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's like you've heard, but you're continuing on with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16362.864s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're continuing on with everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16364.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have members that are concerned that there might be actors that might be applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16370.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How are they going to distinguish which ones are actors and which ones are not actors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16375.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I am frustrated to the point that I am so disheartened with my school committee, something I cherished very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16385.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to keep on listening to this for the next four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16390.086s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And no one has discussed anything about our school, our kids going back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16394.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as member McLaughlin, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16397.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not up to the school committee to make the policy of how they're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16401.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have to be involved in that planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16404.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16408.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, this is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16410.363s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one is saying to change your values change your opinion, change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16415.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're just asking, or I'm asking, slow down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16419.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: pick it and do it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16422.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As far as people saying they've heard us, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16425.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because if you listen to what's going on tonight, for the last four hours of participation, you've had both people that are for it and people that are against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16433.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it seems that the people are for it have been listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16437.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the people that are not for it, for whatever reason, everybody has the right to believe what they wanna believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16444.82s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Put the kids first tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16448.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and postponing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16450.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd like to know if the process is gonna be like this to make sure our kids are gonna have proms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16455.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What's the MCAS gonna be like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16457.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be an MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16458.869s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be any type of social break for the kids this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16463.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23094.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just ask the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23095.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23096.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you still going to be taking names of Italian people or people in history with Italian names?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23104.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is that off the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23108.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23111.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, and then what I do ask is that, you know, for some people it's the name, for some people it's what it represents and doesn't represent, and some people believe certain readings that they have read, some have other opinions, but really keep in mind, you know, it's about culture, it's about history, it's about, yes, it's about Italians that did come into the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23140.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and didn't make, made a lot of sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23143.783s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I am an Italian, I understand exactly what the, just, you know, diversity is and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23152.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's not about the Italian name, and that's what I've been hearing tonight, then I really recommend that an Italian name be selected, because it feels as an Italian American, and I truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23166.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: believe this is that it's wiping out a lot of what you know the community stood for, and I understand about the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23175.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know about the diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23176.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know about progress, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23179.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it seems like we've been asking all night to postpone or whatever, and even though people have listened, they haven't heard, and people are gonna get upset that I said that, but at least listen to the fact that we do have more than just a name attached to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23198.82s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more that, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, but there's a lot more that maybe people are not aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23206.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that maybe if they ask the people that live in the city and has doesn't have to be, you don't have to be here your whole life, you don't have to be here 10 months, you don't have to be here a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23215.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying listen, and really understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23220.092s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not just about a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10421.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we all come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14810.72s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, am I all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14813.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14815.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I've been listening to the meeting tonight, and I know you said give me two minutes, but I'm gonna try my best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14822.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been listening to the meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14825.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As some of you might know or not know, I am a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14830.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I try to listen with fair ears and to listen to all sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14837.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It seems like listening to all the subcommittee meetings that you've had, and with the mandate of, let's say, the commissioner, there's a lot on everyone's plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14852.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there has to be a president's, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't get this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14860.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're talking about process, we're talking about priorities and looking at what you have on your plate, you have budgets coming, you have the, you know, you have parents that really don't know if they want to select hybrid if they do want to select hybrid if they want to have their students in school, there's a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14880.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With all due respect, you guys have spent a lot of time on this, but I can guarantee you there's going to be a lot more phone calls from a lot of people right now, asking about the differences between, you know, what they choose what they don't choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14895.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess, from what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14899.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not the fact of, do you want to name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14903.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Don't you want the name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14905.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I'm respectfully asking is asking the school committee and you, the mayor, as the chair, to really consider putting the priority of putting our children back into school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14916.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know you've been working diligently on trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14920.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you have the commissioner of the state of Massachusetts, who is going to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14925.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: putting mandates and putting his own spin on certain things, even though it might not seem fair, it's going to have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14934.773s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And listening to the results of the decrease of the positive COVID tests, I mean, listening to a lot of the people that have already called and made decisions to the school system,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14950.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to let them know if their children are going hybrid and stuff, you do have a lot of positives going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14957.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when the commissioner looks at something like that, he's going to know that here's a city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14963.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: who is going to be positive, and he's going to be putting more pressure on that because the numbers that decrease in COVID are huge as far as the lesser we have, the better opportunity to get back into the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14978.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14980.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I know there's a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14984.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, high passionate people out there for or against this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14990.001s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But honestly, at this point, I really just ask the school committee to please put your priorities intact as far as this just came up the pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15000.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16077.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16078.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So basically, listening to everyone, again, I mean, what everybody's put on the table is extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16085.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally agree about the non-rushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16087.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that even with that being said, there might be members that don't believe that it's a rushed decision, but I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16098.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: member credits for bringing up the no name situation, because I know that that's been out there and people were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16107.147s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, you know it's time is of the essence, and you have so much going on that now you're here this evening, you've already spoken about it, I understand how the rules go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16120.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But now you're going to spend Wednesday night discussing this all over again and going into it in more depth and detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16129.641s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess stepping back and looking at what's going on and what's being asked of from cities and towns all over the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16139.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It just seems that that time that you're spending on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16143.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one is saying that, at least, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16148.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying the priority of the dates and the time that you have and what you need to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16155.231s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16156.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I truly believe that the time should be spent on getting the kids back in school, what the game plan is, how much money is it going to cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16164.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have custodians that are going to have to be cleaning a lot more than what they're doing now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16168.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, what do you have in the budget set aside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16170.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, there's a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16173.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I respectfully just say, you know, it's really to look at your timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=706.537s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=707.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=765.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=766.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=767.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=769.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Minutes for December 11, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=876.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 7.15 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or p.m.?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: P.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=882.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=987.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=988.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=989.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=999.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1006.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1017.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you as a committee have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1023.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1024.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very, we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1038.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1054.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1058.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1060.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1062.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1064.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1065.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1067.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.641s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1075.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1080.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1278.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1279.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1280.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1281.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: DiBenedetto and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1630.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1666.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Skerry just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1673.291s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just want to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1677.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1681.221s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1686.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1695.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1706.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1711.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1714.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1718.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1720.121s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1721.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1724.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1741.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1744.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1749.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1751.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1885.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1944.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1945.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1948.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1949.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He's done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1951.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, we appreciate all that he's done, all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1955.425s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1970.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I should have known better than to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1974.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1976.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're building this for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1978.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So may I interrupt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1982.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1983.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by, uh, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1984.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vander Kloof, I believe it was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1986.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1996.367s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1997.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1999.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Smith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2002.611s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2004.432s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2496.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2505.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2507.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, OK, because we got it approved last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2510.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this is, OK, three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2511.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then, just because it's been such a great program, and already there's been so much going on, at the end of the three years, have they already discussed, like, what the process is going to be, if you're going to be able to reapply for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2525.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are going to be able to reapply, or is this, like, one of those, you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2545.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2551.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2565.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2571.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2574.436s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2576.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2585.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2591.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2594.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2603.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2612.073s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2614.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2617.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2626.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there, because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2634.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here, they're in our center of our square, they're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2640.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2644.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3406.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3407.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3409.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3412.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that we were, that you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3413.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3416.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3423.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3427.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3433.044s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And around the year, they have certain lunches that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3435.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know why, because our kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3437.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3443.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Tell them what you're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3445.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3449.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3451.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3452.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3453.871s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3457.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3731.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my, yes, and my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3738.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3739.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3740.309s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3741.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3744.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3748.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3752.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3755.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, and opening up your mind that for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3760.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3761.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3765.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you know, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3775.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3776.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3779.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3860.511s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3983.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, do you, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to like introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4036.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4037.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4041.528s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And up next is Kayla Malone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4043.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4177.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4186.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4187.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4191.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing, the creative workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4200.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4204.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4208.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4213.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4224.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4235.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4237.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4239.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: play that on our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4241.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.444s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4319.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spock, you had said that you're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4327.55s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4328.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4377.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4378.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4438.698s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4440.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4442.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4443.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4447.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: By Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4448.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4450.166s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4453.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, seven in the affirmative, the report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4461.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4464.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4470.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4476.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4487.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program, is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4492.993s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it, and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford, and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4505.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4508.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4509.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4512.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4513.326s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4517.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4672.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be starting... No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4686.622s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4687.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4691.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4692.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4695.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the way that is, but in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4705.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4713.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4716.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved, or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and saying, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4748.434s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4751.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4752.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4754.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4755.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4756.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4758.837s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4761.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4765.841s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5136.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5153.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5163.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5168.024s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5169.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion passes, and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5172.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you receive and place this report on file?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5174.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5178.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge, I mean, sorry, charge policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5191.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5827.29s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5834.594s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5835.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the amount is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Klooten, and then we'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6275.849s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said, if the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6286.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6291.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6293.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what, and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6300.079s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6311.979s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6315.382s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we have that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6316.984s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But don't approve, make it separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6319.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And don't approve the amount until maybe you could come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6537.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.728s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6574.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6586.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6587.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6588.203s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6590.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6591.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6610.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6611.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6616.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6619.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6621.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6656.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6663.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6664.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6665.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6667.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6670.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6671.865s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6729.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7501.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7578.228s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Someone said I was completely correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7585.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7586.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to you, staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7594.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7596.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7604.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here and sometimes over the years I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7613.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7615.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7617.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7620.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7623.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7628.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7633.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7639.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7645.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free-for-all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7653.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7873.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perola, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7885.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to ask real quick, what are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7892.774s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7911.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7967.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7976.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7978.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7983.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8024.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8037.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8191.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kathy, did you have your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8507.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8626.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8631.653s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8641.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8644.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8646.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8649.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8656.25s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8657.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8660.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about this, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8666.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8668.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8677.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, OK, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8689.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8690.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8694.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8699.701s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8702.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8703.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8851.738s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8864.289s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9259.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9871.496s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9876.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9882.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9892.854s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9896.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9901.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the new member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9903.317s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9907.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9912.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9915.24s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9923.843s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and keep what's important in here, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9928.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9929.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, with that being said, always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9940.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9951.213s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9955.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9956.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the side councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9958.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9960.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9965.699s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9969.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9981.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9982.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9984.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9988.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door and to the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10000.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perrella, really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10008.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10014.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10017.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is she gonna come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10019.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10023.687s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10028.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10031.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10035.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight who probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10045.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10050.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son, Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who has always been there for me to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10060.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10093.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's no more, I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10096.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was the relaxing part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=373.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=374.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=375.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=377.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=389.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=394.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigny, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=404.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=414.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=422.316s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to put that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=446.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=468.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=469.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Put them all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=495.977s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=498.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is everyone's mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=501.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=503.258s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=507.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Move to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=509.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=511.36s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz, you all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=633.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=634.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Scari, motion and the second of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=639.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=663.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=664.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we need a roll call on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=757.936s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to approve the payrolls and place on file have passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=762.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=773.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, report of the committee, which is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=775.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees, committee of the whole meeting, minutes for December 11th, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=885.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 715 AM or PM?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=996.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=998.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1008.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1015.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1019.541s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1026.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you, as a committee, have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1032.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1033.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1042.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1047.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1063.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1066.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1067.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1069.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1071.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1073.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1074.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1076.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.68s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.86s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1084.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1089.184s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1639.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1675.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scottie just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1682.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1686.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1690.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school, but with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1704.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1713.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1715.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see, are we gonna roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1723.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1727.936s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1729.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1730.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1749.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1750.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1753.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1760.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1887.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you could just make sure that during the year you let us know how students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1954.286s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1956.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2005.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2006.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2008.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Schmitt as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2011.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2014.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2505.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2514.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2516.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: first and then just because it's been such a great program and already there's been so much going on at the end of the three years have they already discussed like what the process is going to be if you're going to be able to reapply for it or is it so we are going to be able to reapply or is it like one of those you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time oh okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2547.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're looking for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2554.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2560.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2573.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2580.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2583.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2585.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2594.804s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2600.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2603.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2612.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2621.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2623.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2626.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2635.334s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2637.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2643.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2645.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're in our center of our square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2647.177s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2649.138s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2653.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2655.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3415.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3416.396s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that, and she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3421.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3425.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3432.37s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3436.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3439.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times, and around the year they have certain lunches that they do, and I know it's hard, because our kids are in school, but if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves, tell them what you're there for, and maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3458.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3460.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3461.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did hear about that, and it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3469.34s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many did you steal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3747.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3748.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3749.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3750.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3753.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that, and you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3761.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart and, you know, and opening up your mind that, for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3769.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3770.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3774.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3784.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3785.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3810.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3811.263s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4045.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4046.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4186.653s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4195.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4196.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio stations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4200.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4206.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, the creative workshops, something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4213.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4217.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4222.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4233.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4244.908s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4246.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4247.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we could play that on our station, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4326.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4328.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spocker, you had said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4331.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4335.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4336.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4338.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4339.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4386.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4387.514s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4449.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4450.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4451.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4452.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4454.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4455.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4460.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4461.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4463.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 7 in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4465.063s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4469.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4470.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4471.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4473.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4479.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4485.535s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4496.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4501.944s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4514.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4517.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4518.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4522.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4525.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Christopher Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4677.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4681.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be static?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4693.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4695.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4696.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4700.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval only, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4701.946s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.027s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the way that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.728s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4714.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4722.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4725.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4728.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and say, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4757.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4760.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4761.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4763.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4764.265s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4765.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4767.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4770.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4774.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4940.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5145.719s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5162.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5174.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5175.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5176.95s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5178.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion passes and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5183.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5187.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5200.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5828.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When does this draft have to be accepted by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5836.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5844.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the amount isn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5850.656s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, excuse me, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5852.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5970.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5971.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot and then may I go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess with what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6284.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6288.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6295.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6300.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6302.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6309.131s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6319.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: approve what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government so we have that piece but don't approve, like make it separate and don't approve the amount until maybe you can come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanderbilt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6567.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6583.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6595.234s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6596.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6597.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6599.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6600.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6621.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6622.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if I may, I should condemn it to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.622s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6630.364s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6665.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6666.733s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6667.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6672.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6674.709s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6676.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6679.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6738.61s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6887.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7130.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7510.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7597.908s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: say thank you to you, the staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7603.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7605.795s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7613.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here, and sometimes over the years, I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7622.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7624.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7626.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7629.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7632.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7637.68s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7642.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7648.775s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7654.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free for all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7662.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7882.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Peralta, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7895.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to ask real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7897.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7900.514s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7920.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7977.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7985.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right, you have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7992.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion, so it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8033.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8044.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8110.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8118.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The gadget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8119.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The gadget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8120.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we were just passing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8516.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8635.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece, but an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8650.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8653.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8655.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8658.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8665.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8667.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8669.96s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8675.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8677.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8690.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know, I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, okay, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8698.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8699.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8703.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8708.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, this is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8712.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8862.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8863.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.581s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8873.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.118s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9266.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9268.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9556.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you lived in my house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9558.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's like yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9881.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: some time to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9883.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9885.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9891.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9901.86s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9905.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was the new member, and within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9916.946s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9921.248s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9924.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9932.853s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And keep what's important in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9937.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9938.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9941.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9949.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9961.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9964.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9965.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the site councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9967.166s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9969.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state, and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9974.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9978.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent, who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9990.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9991.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9993.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9997.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door into the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present, Dr. Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10011.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10017.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10023.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10026.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is she going to come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10028.581s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10032.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10037.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10041.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10044.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight, probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10054.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10059.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who's always been there for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10066.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10068.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But just work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10102.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10105.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a relaxing time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=107.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=108.046s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=734.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=754.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=757.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=764.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=765.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there is something out there, at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=773.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Especially when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=853.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Points of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.794s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.934s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Bonilla?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=856.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=861.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=864.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=876.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=880.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=894.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=900.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=908.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=914.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=931.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=948.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=957.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=959.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=985.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3594.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3601.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3606.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3607.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3614.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3618.891s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3619.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3623.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3624.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3628.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3629.779s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3633.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3635.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3643.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3651.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3655.297s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3656.538s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3661.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3664.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3669.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3691.611s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, OK, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3701.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3704.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3706.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3707.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3712.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3714.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3720.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3729.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3733.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3747.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3751.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3855.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3856.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3861.844s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3866.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3874.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3876.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3883.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3885.453s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3888.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3890.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3894.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3918.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or, gee, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3923.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park, I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3930.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3939.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or anything like that, you know, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3944.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3948.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3953.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3955.02s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3961.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3972.149s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3975.733s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3976.794s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3978.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3981.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3988.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, well, gee, do you know what secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3993.069s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3999.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4003.198s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4007.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4009.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4011.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4021.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4022.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4027.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4092.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd be very interested to start doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4095.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4096.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4099.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping, to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4106.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4109.261s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4110.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4127.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4144.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out, because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4151.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4320.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4330.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4335.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4339.993s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, they don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4358.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4359.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5283.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.805s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5286.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into a vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5297.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5298.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5302.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5307.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind and as kids we've been trained in our minds too is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5318.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5319.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5320.637s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5322.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6823.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6824.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6826.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because we won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6830.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I'm going to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6836.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6841.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6855.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy and I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6867.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6873.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6883.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and in English, and I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6886.131s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6927.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6928.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they just come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6942.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6947.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6951.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6958.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6964.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7637.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7667.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7754.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, at a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8286.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8309.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8317.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8319.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8321.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8698.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or two months or seven months, they don't even bring it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=99.231s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=725.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=745.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=747.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=749.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=751.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=755.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=759.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: okay let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=862.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=867.209s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=883.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: have to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=891.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=900.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=906.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=922.211s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=931.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=939.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=947.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=953.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=954.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=959.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=962.846s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=964.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The player always wants to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=966.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we as adults have to take responsibility, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=968.927s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=970.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=971.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=972.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=976.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3585.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3592.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3597.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3598.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3600.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3609.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3610.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3614.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3615.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3619.334s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3620.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3624.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3626.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3635.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3642.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3652.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3655.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3660.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it for our drama students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3662.859s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not picking on clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3664.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying as examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3666.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3675.979s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3681.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3692.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3695.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3697.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3698.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3702.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We, you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3705.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3711.364s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3720.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3724.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3742.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3744.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, those numbers are very low, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3846.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3848.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3857.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3865.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3867.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3874.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3876.471s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3879.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3881.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3885.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3890.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3909.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3914.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3918.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3921.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3939.057s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3943.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3946.044s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3963.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3966.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3967.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3969.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3979.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3984.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3990.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3994.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4000.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4003.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4008.704s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4018.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4085.883s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4087.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4090.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4100.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4101.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4118.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4135.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4151.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4309.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4326.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4328.069s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4330.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4346.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: At least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4348.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4350.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5274.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.277s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5277.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5288.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5292.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5304.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5309.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5310.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5311.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5313.188s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6814.955s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Esconia, I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6820.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6821.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6826.24s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6831.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6846.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6850.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6855.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6858.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6864.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6875.032s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6877.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6918.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6919.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6926.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6938.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6942.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6949.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6955.613s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7624.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7628.449s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7629.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7661.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7675.671s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: until after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7745.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed like at an E.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8277.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8278.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8279.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8283.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8290.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8300.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8308.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8310.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8679.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8689.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8699.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What if they don't even bring it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8705.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8319.267s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8341.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8343.253s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone else that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8345.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8346.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their cell phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8347.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8349.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8354.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as my colleague said I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8357.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8438.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: points of information they are very.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8441.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to address the street alleys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8445.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The question of the discussion actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8447.432s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In my in my came out with a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8452.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cushion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8453.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Policy and a probably about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8456.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8459.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8472.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is the coaches have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8474.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Administration has to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8475.927s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The students have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8477.468s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8479.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8484.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nurses the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8493.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: uh... fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8520.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to that trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8521.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Gets evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8523.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has to go to a doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8525.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8533.877s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8539.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: unless that trainer okays you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8542.481s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8547.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8548.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8553.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8556.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8558.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: player always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8562.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8566.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11180.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11186.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11191.382s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11192.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11199.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11208.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11209.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11213.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11215.001s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11218.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11220.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11229.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11236.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11240.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11241.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening, you know, for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11246.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like, are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11249.706s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11254.89s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11276.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11286.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around, you know, is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11289.772s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11291.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11292.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, there's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11297.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11300.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11305.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11314.484s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11318.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11332.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11336.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11440.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11442.203s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11447.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11452.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11459.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11461.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11468.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11470.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11473.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11475.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11476.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just because they're not things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11479.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately we have seen situations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11493.894s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: from you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11512.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11529.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11533.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11538.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11539.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11546.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11560.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11561.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11563.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11573.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11578.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11584.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11588.278s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11595.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11597.145s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11606.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11607.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11612.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11679.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11682.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11684.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11688.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11690.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11693.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11694.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11695.95s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11712.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11721.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11729.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11736.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11905.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11916.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11920.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11921.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11924.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11942.634s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11945.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12870.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12882.546s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12883.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12887.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12892.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12895.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12905.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12907.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14409.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14411.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14416.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14421.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14426.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14441.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14449.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14452.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14459.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14469.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14471.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14512.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14513.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14528.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14533.038s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14536.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14544.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15222.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15255.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15339.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, outside of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15871.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15894.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15903.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15904.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15907.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16284.036s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=464.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=466.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, congratulations, Eva.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=468.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=469.706s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually participated in that a few years back, and it was just an amazing, amazing day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=477.729s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you're not involved with it, unfortunately, and we didn't know about it, but I had the opportunity to go down and to see students from all over the state really working together, and what a camaraderie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=489.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for students that really didn't know each other at the beginning of the day to really become very friendly by the end of the day and they were all working really for the cause of a larger community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=500.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I mean it's just amazing and I want to thank you and I also want to thank the other student for representing Medford so well but I have a question for you and that is what is it that you did?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=512.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=519.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.468s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So come back and let us know what you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=522.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=523.931s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=524.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1459.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What's going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1460.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, for Miss Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1464.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1465.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1466.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, my question is, well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to all the veterans that come each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1471.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's been a 17-year program that you've been running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1475.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's been fabulous, because I know the students get a lot out of it, just as much as the veterans do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1479.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also, a thank you, if we can, send a letter to Mr. Lindsay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1484.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who's the director of the veterans just to just as it as a thank-you note from us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1489.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the other thing is is that you were speaking of we don't have the veterans anymore from certain errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1494.44s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1495.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I don't know this is just to throw it out there, but Maybe invite like children of the veterans from that era that have heard the stories that still have stories to share and just give an insight to our students from that era and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1570.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1571.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, you're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1572.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also a letter to Mr. Kreatz, who Noah's been an amazing asset to a lot of these programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1579.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And his enthusiasm and his experience, even though he hasn't, thankfully, gone, but he does have a lot of knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1586.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's really nice to see a young student who shares that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1590.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1591.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1640.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Give him some donuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1643.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll give him some donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2327.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But actually there was one part that Mr. Carlo has missed and that is Sandra also said that she does speak Spanish and because she had the opportunity of taking Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2341.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that she fell in love with the language and the culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2344.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that's an important piece, because no matter how many languages we speak as a district, when we have the opportunity, and here I have to say thank you to Cassett, because Cassett is where it starts in the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2357.449s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, and it continues through the middle schools, and it continues to the high school, and it's a great opportunity for Cassett, but also a great opportunity for us, and to thank all the teachers that have always been involved, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3478.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Pugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3479.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3480.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Through you to the superintendent, is there a way for us to find out how the other schools in our area were graded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3494.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But yeah, I'd like to see the list of the surrounding schools and and just in general other schools Yeah, but it doesn't give that information just to see I can get you the rest of it just was a lot of pages No, and I understand that and I'm not asking for the whole report I'm just asking so that way we have an idea of where we rank compared to if it's okay with you What I'll do is I'll pick some area schools and give you you know some comparable type schools like Waltham and Winchester<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3521.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I guess my other concern is We rate you know according to their standards We rated high does is that jeopardize any type of grant or anything that we're going to be going for because I mean Because we we graded very high based on their requisites I just don't want to jeopardize anything out there that we're waiting for like capital planning money or anything like that I mean are they going to take that into consideration obviously they're going to look at buildings that are for and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3599.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And was the tour across the board, like when they came to the high school, did they see the whole high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3606.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the same thing with all the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3625.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want them to say that they went into the science labs at the high school and just assumed that the rest of the school is like that, because it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3636.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Keep on telling them that, because it has to go through the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3641.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4123.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4125.291s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I have had the opportunity, and I know what people are going to say out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4129.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, you know, the people that always agree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4133.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, my discussion is not about whether I agree or disagree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4139.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4140.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just a thank you for the person that he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4144.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's been many a times that there are a lot of us that agree or disagree, but this is out of respect, out of respect for the gentleman that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4152.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've had the opportunity, not only as a Medford School Committee member, but also as a president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to actually go around the state with Mr. Bellson to see how he has represented us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4166.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: always having us top of the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4171.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know people agree to disagree, but you really don't know it all when you're not behind this reel, unfortunately, because there are a lot of things that it's amazing to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4183.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I went to the statehouse and there was a discussion and the superintendent went and he testified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4191.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there were other superintendents there that day that were testifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4195.056s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's amazing to see the amount of people that after they're done with their discussion, the reporters and other people from the state house, all those superintendents were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4207.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody went to Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4209.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who did he talk about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4211.443s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He talked about the people in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4213.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not only the students and the parents, but the teachers and everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4218.527s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't want to talk about agreeing or disagreeing, because that's why we're here, to be respectful behind and in front of the reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4228.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is where you come to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4230.617s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is where you come to express what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4238.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's funny, Paulette just said something about he'll answer that phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4242.621s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: when he's on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4244.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I remember 12 years ago when I started and I wanted to bring the summer program into fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4251.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember going to that school the first day, and we had tons of kids there with parents dropping them off, and of course it was the hottest day, and the summer hadn't even started, and the people in charge had shut the air conditioning on me, and I called him, and he answered, and I'm like, I am sorry, but, and I went into a rage, and he's like, don't worry, he's like, the second I get off the plane, because I'm stepping on the plane, he says, I will call, and that air conditioning was on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4281.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's things like that that you remember, but honestly when I've had the opportunity to go around the state and I've had the opportunity nationally to tell people that we've had superintendents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4292.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's amazing, because they say, what do you mean you have a superintendent who's been there all these years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4296.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're lucky if you get someone who stays with you two to three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4299.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4301.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it in the communities around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4303.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right now, it's very difficult to get someone who's very qualified, because the candidate pool is not that large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when people tell me you work with a school committee, or you work as a school committee, or you actually speak to your superintendent, again, it seemed very strange to me, because I just assumed this is how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4325.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am in total shock when I hear other school committee members across the state that tell me, what are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4332.146s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What do you mean you have community participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4334.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm like, well, that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4336.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're here for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4337.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They should have participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4339.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4340.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're not allowed to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4342.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so there are things that we just assume as a school committee member, as a parent, as a teacher, administrator, what we're used to sometimes, we're just assuming this is how it is across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4354.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're always complaining about what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4357.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you have the opportunity to go outside your city and to see what other things and other people are doing and other cities and towns are doing, again, there's always improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4366.935s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bar is always raised up high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4368.937s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But to see where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4371.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: is just really, you know, it's, I'm very happy to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4376.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I have to say that it's people like the superintendent who go out there with their passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4382.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and get what we have, because it's not that easy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4385.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, I just wanted to acknowledge, actually, Mr. John Costas from the Medford Electric for the donation of installations of many of the lights at the Marsha Caron Theatre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4705.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The lighting that he just put in, he donated everything, and the lights that we have now will enhance the stage and the theatre itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4714.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to see if we could invite Mr. Costa for... He does a lot more than just that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4723.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4724.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, this was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4725.685s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4727.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if we could just invite him the next time we have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1135.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1136.011s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you to the Democratic Board Committee and to all of you for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1140.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My name is Ann Marie Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1142.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I graduated and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in foreign languages and in criminal justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1147.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a lifelong resident of Medford, along with my husband, Michael, we were married after graduation, and we've been married for 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1155.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have four sons, and they have all graduated from the Medford public school system, pursuing their careers and education, continuing on their road to success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1164.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the Medford School Committee for the past 12 years and served as president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, a position which allowed me the opportunity to work on state and national levels, continuing to represent Medford on discussions of important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1182.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why am I seeking city council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1183.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For the same reason I ran for school committee, to make constructive changes and a positive difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1190.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: During my tenure of the Medford School Committee, I introduced changes and presented fresh ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1196.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Collectively passed many successful programs along with my committee colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1202.479s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We approved and implemented changes ranging from technology to building upgrades and educational programs, some utilizing state and federal grants to underwrite the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1213.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have worked and collaborated with local, state, and federal elected officials, appointed to the state local government committee with both Governors Patrick and Governor Baker,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1224.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Advocated in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1226.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for the Massachusetts Federal Relations Network Delegation, meeting with members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican alike, while always having time to meet with our students, parents and teachers and administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1240.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Replying honestly to all and keeping true to myself, building consensus along the way, and at times agreeing to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1250.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a city councilor, I will bring the same positive changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1254.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We as elected officials need to make the correct, non-partisan decisions on the issues, not based on the party line or a special group, but based on what is beneficial for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1267.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a master plan, but now it is time to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1271.902s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is a lot of discussions about the revitalization of Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1276.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The talk needs to stop, and we need to make it a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1282.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1283.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to take pride in our city by starting with cleanup for all retail squares, such as off hours, trash removal in the retail areas, upgrade the lighting to be brighter and more inviting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1296.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With Chevalier Theatre partnering with Professional Management Company, we have a window of opportunity to make the heart of our city, Medford Square, more appealing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1305.555s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: welcoming upscale stores, art galleries, restaurants, adding affordable housing, a proper city parking facility, and maybe even a movie theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1314.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our neighborhoods also need attention, not only the streets and the sidewalks, but proper planning in our zoning to keep our city a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1324.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Comprehensive plan to repair our streets,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1327.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All the city streets, we need to hold contractors to a higher standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1332.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They need to return our streets to safe and passable ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1336.447s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Anything less is not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1339.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Making our city into the vibrant, exciting and upcoming city it can and it will become, just as the ones around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1348.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to incorporate the appeal of our city to all ages, including our children, by giving them an opportunity to want to return to an affordable and vibrant community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1358.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let me ask, what has changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1361.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The amount of land in the square has not shrunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1364.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our family and community values have not vanished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1367.823s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am aware we do not have the amount of land space that other cities have, but with a comprehensive plan, we have enough space to get to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1376.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: By doing so, the other jewels of our city will also benefit, such as Haines Square,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1383.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: West Medford, the Hillside, Wellington, Glenwood, in all our entire city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1389.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Revisit the parking issue, making it sensible for all, providing a more concise and transparent program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1396.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1398.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Under these circumstances, things will not change over at night, and it will take time, but it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1405.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We cannot afford for discussions to continue based on who to blame instead of going forward in a positive and a productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1413.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am a candidate who votes on the issue, not a promise for the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1418.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am a proven candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1421.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have made changes, not just by talking, but by rolling up my sleeves and getting the work done, which in itself makes me a uniquely qualified candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1431.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Continue bringing new ideas, integrity, hard work, and passion to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1436.196s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It will positively impact our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1439.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I ask for your trust in me and your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1441.877s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Number 10 on the Medford City ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1514.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1516.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1517.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1520.457s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1522.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1529.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Westmark, nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1534.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1536.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1541.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1548.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1572.538s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: my concentration went away, but different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1576.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1591.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have like people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field or, you know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1607.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1611.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's something down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1664.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1679.259s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1684.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1688.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1693.594s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue, or if it's something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2745.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.948s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2750.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2761.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2770.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2776.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2782.59s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2788.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I get it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2790.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2792.601s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and then they disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2800.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you now had a different way of thinking about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2825.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2830.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2837.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2840.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2848.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2865.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2871.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2881.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2885.84s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2886.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2892.902s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2894.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2900.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.495s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also, the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3400.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3403.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3405.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3419.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Brazil,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3427.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3435.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3442.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3449.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3456.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have to make a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3457.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3458.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So motion to approve that the superintendent goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3689.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3693.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3697.754s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3705.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3711.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3727.651s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3729.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3756.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3766.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4097.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4098.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4105.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4106.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4108.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5412.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5415.36s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5417.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5420.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5526.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: even across the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5569.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5822.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5825.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5836.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5849.484s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5851.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5852.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5859.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5861.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5863.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5866.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5874.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5966.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5970.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5984.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5985.48s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5987.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5994.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6003.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6005.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6008.121s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state for our positions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6012.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Roberts Rules of Order, there's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6025.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6027.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6855.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6856.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6882.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6884.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6889.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6923.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so then, but the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6952.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7435.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7471.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we can make sure we put something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7472.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7483.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7486.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7656.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7657.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7665.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I went back and forth with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7711.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7716.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the ninth grade and then all of a sudden the tenth grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7728.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7732.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7736.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7739.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7750.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7757.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7763.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7774.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fair to those students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7775.959s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fair to anybody, but those students especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=9283.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Every time we look around, we just say, it's a homeless people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=9285.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they have names, they have dreams and paths and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=877.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.846s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=879.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=880.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=883.91s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=886.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=893.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Westmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=897.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=900.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=904.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=911.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=936.329s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concentration went away, but different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=939.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=954.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=962.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=966.626s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=970.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=974.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=980.555s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=983.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1027.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1034.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know if there's any time in classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1036.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school, or maybe in a Saturday, or if the business is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1048.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1052.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue or if it's something they thought they were interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2110.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2112.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2113.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't a hundred percent sure before we started the meeting and I sat down with you really quick, but I would have asked you a thousand questions because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do is it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2134.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2137.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2140.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2145.967s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2152.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I get it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2153.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2155.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes, and then they disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2164.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you now had a different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2167.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: way of thinking about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2189.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2194.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2201.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2204.251s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2211.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2228.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2235.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2245.396s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2256.302s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2258.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2264.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2763.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2766.923s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2781.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2782.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2799.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2806.257s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2810.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2812.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, so I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2817.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, um, with that, do I have to make a motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3056.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3061.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3068.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3075.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3091.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3092.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3120.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3129.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3468.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3469.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3471.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4775.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4778.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4781.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4783.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4889.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: even across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4932.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.549s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.729s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5186.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5189.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5199.883s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5207.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5212.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5214.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5215.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5222.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5224.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5226.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5230.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be internships and co-ops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5236.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5237.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5329.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5334.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5347.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5348.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5350.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5357.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5368.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5371.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5374.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5379.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5389.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5390.608s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, just for a clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6245.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6248.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6252.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6288.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6315.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6798.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6834.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we can make sure we put something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6835.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6846.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7019.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7020.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7028.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I went back and forth with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7074.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7079.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the 9th grade and then all of a sudden the 10th grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7091.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7095.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7099.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7102.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7114.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7120.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7126.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=886.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=888.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=889.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=892.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=894.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=901.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Westmark, nope, I have to get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=905.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=908.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=912.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city that it would really be beneficial I think and speaking to others that I think this would go hand in hand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=926.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: if we're able to put our students into the community and have them have some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=937.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a hotel in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=940.709s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=943.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=950.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students, and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=962.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=970.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=974.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=979.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields, but if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=988.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=991.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1035.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during the day, because I know they have a lot on their plates and you don't want to lose any time in classes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1044.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school or maybe in a Saturday or if the business is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1051.111s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1056.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to see kids, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1060.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1065.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1069.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and they want to pursue, or if it's something they thought they were interested in and they want to go to a different field altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1074.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2118.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2120.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2122.331s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2133.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2142.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums, not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2147.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2154.337s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2156.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: children all the time or anyone just to be careful what you write you know I get it all the time the snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes I want to know from you what have you learned as far as like these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and they disappear have you now had a different way of thinking about that yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2195.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2197.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2202.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2209.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2212.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes, as adults, we'll say it and, oh, no, it's not true, or you don't know about it, or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2219.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2224.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, that was one of the biggest things is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards and the employers are looking into everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2237.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, it has to be something that you really, I hope,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2241.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2243.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2252.598s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2257.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2258.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2264.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2266.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2268.401s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2272.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2762.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2771.835s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2775.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2782.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2791.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2807.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2810.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2814.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2821.354s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2825.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And with that, do I have to make a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2829.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2830.278s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So motion to approve that the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3065.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3069.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3077.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent go and Mr. Zizek go, if discussion comes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3085.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: up in as far as what will be done in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3088.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3099.373s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3101.134s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on that Mr. Azuz will go before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3108.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3115.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The teleconference I knew of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3128.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3137.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Martinello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3476.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3478.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, we're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3480.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper, and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4784.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4786.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4789.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4791.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4894.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The 48 teachers that were involved, are they even across the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4922.373s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What have the teachers heard from the students as far as feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4940.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5192.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5193.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5194.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5195.12s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5197.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5208.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like, construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5221.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5230.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5232.306s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5233.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5234.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5238.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5239.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be internships and co-ops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5240.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5324.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: To be a delegate or an alternate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5338.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5342.326s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5356.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5357.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5359.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5365.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5377.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5379.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5383.142s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5387.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5397.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5398.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6225.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6226.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6228.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6254.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6256.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6260.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6296.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6303.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6329.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the Councilors from the other schools or the BCP from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6337.703s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6806.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6842.651s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we make sure we put something, because I know that there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with the same child or even with older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6854.614s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they can get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7027.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7028.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7035.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or were they granted because we went back and forth with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7082.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7087.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7090.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if they're taking these MCAS in the ninth grade, and then all of a sudden, the 10th grade, it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7096.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7099.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7103.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I mean, I just hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7105.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7107.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7110.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7114.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th grade and then all of a sudden we change it overnight on them and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7128.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that because I'm sure, I mean I know the administration does, I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1275.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1277.891s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1282.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1287.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1299.556s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1300.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1306.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work, and it's currently in certain places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1314.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1318.512s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1324.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1331.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1352.142s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: then the parents would come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1355.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1404.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1410.063s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1418.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1436.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So why should she have to give on anything, but you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1443.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1453.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1460.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1463.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if there's any other, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2039.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2045.102s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, the children could go to school Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2052.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2063.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2074.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2078.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2083.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2085.541s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2111.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get, like, because you said they missed school today, because she didn't want to drop them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2116.772s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is beyond you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4189.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was one of my biggest, it was one of my things on my to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4193.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4197.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4202.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has proved itself many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4206.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm very proud of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4210.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4211.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5960.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5961.036s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5976.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5979.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5992.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here, what's happened is we've kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5999.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it's always an option, maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that, we've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses, we have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school really to the max,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6028.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you kind of do want to leave I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood But parents have actually opted to stay within the system or within their district I should say within their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6041.64s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's say in a larger in a larger way when it came to the middle school it was always more of a choice and I think that's how that's the reason we've gone that way and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6051.006s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's gonna camp it's together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6053.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advise parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6065.614s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6074.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6079.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6085.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6095.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1043.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1045.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3978.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3978.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5727.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5728.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5743.922s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5747.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5759.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5764.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what's happened is we've kind of, it's always an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5768.84s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored like the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5782.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5788.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5793.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: really to the max, and you kind of do want to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5798.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood, but parents have actually opted to stay within the system, or within their district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5806.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I shouldn't say district, within their neighborhood, let's say, in a larger way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5811.046s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When it came to the middle school, it was always more of a choice, and I think that's the reason we've gone that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5818.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they sit on a campus together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5820.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5832.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5841.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5847.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5852.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5862.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=8424.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1044.511s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1049.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1052.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1066.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1067.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm reading this and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1073.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1077.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1078.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's currently in certain places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1080.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1085.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1091.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there So two days a week no, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us That's on the documentation so what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know we want to we want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1110.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Understand where you're coming from but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford Then the parents would come to an agreement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1122.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1163.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities and towns that the other parent is willing to move to, including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield, and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1176.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not going to move out of there, or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1185.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1187.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1205.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading or Wakefield or Reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1209.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, but what I'm saying is that, I'm just going by what you're saying, and that is that even if we opened up Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1215.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: According to the documentation that you have given us from the court<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1219.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1227.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1230.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if there's any other, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1234.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's the motion, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1804.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I follow up on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1806.835s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1808.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we first spoke, and up until just a little while ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1811.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, because the children could go to school Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1818.658s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1820.139s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, well, five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1826.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Every week, since March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1827.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1829.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, but there's... So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1841.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1844.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1850.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1852.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1877.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1880.331s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because she said they missed school today because she didn't want to drop them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3955.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was one of my things on my to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3959.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3963.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3968.738s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has proved itself many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3972.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm very proud of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3978.006s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5726.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5727.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5743.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5817.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's on a campus together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5819.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5831.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5840.701s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean we've had situations because our children some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn middle school Their children stayed in the McGlynn elementary school because that's it was a better thing for them But I mean I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized That there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved too But with that being said if parents have called they have been given that choice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=723.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Over the years, that's been something that we've always, as a committee, we've discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=728.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have a jewel in this city, that we do have a vocational school, and we do have a high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=734.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The goal was, and as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=736.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz has pointed out, the goal was is to give the opportunities to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=742.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether they go over to the vocational side or our students from the vocational side go over to our high school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=749.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But as far as the changes that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=751.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz is discussing tonight, I have to say I'm really surprised because with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=757.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The changes, we also made it very clear that we understood the codes that need to be changed because of the laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=764.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we also knew the uniqueness of this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=767.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so listening to all of a sudden the ranking being changed and no valedictorian and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=776.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Those are things that are very, very concerning, not only as parents or school committee members, but take us out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=782.112s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Think of the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=783.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Think of the students that are, especially students that are juniors and seniors this year, that have been thinking of this their whole entire time that they've been up at the high school or have heard of the high school and what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=794.041s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to go down an avenue to make, bless you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=798.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to go down an avenue that takes us that way, this is, as you just mentioned, we are going to have the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=806.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually second Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=807.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cress' motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=809.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It has to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=810.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We can't just expect our students to come in in September and all of a sudden everything changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=815.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to be changing these things, we need to figure out which ones that need to be changed gradually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=822.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's grandfather the students that have been pertaining to this, that it pertains to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=827.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If this is something that we're going to change as far as the valedictorian or the grades or our guidance Councilor being on the other side of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=835.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are things that need to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=836.761s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It can't be discussed or just written in a letter and just sent home or just told on a morning that our students are coming to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=843.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=845.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I am happy that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=882.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I just want to say again, we've already discussed that we're going to have to have a committee of the whole make it really clear out there to our parents and our students are teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=893.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that before, I mean, all this is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=895.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really need to have a discussion, and it has to be an open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=899.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are things that are going on in the school system that, you know, we don't know, that maybe parents are not aware of, so the discussion has to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=907.753s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I hope that parents, you know, come to the table, and students come to the table, bringing their concerns, and we could really have a discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=916.335s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because again, the whole point of really going forward with this was the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=921.617s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a jewel, it is a very different type of situation and thrilled that especially our vocational students have the opportunities because a lot of them are going off to college that have the same type of opportunities and they're not taking night courses and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=935.161s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in the same way, we have to be sensitive in making sure that we're not taking everything away from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=941.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=942.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van De Kloet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1421.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1422.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So James R. Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, to go back on the report that the superintendent just read off,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1959.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague actually mentioned just a little while ago, just to go back real quick on the high school and vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1966.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do urge that we have the committee of the whole sooner rather than later, because there has been tremendous work done by all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1978.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want the information that we got out tonight to really impair that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1984.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So instead of having rumors and things going around like wild and rampant, I really do hope that we can have this meeting of a whole as quickly as possible so that way we can work on this and that we can discuss what really is going on and what changes are going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2002.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is I was just looking at the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2006.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that when we were looking at it, at budget time there was approximately 50 students, more at the Andrews than the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2013.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I thought we were going to try to work something out to maybe even that out a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2017.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So there could be some clarification on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3918.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.606s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, I apologize if any of my colleagues have already said this, but it's kind of hard to hear a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3927.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that the discussion came up with bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3930.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not sure which schools we were talking about or if we were discussing- That was the kids' corner bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3947.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I know in the past couple of years we've actually concentrated on the elementary schools, the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3953.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not 100% sure if we've done anything really big in the high school bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4031.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4032.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't know if it's the microphones, the speakers in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4035.493s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It sounds loud out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4036.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4038.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very muffled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4040.018s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know, as far as the high school ones, because I know that when we've taken our walks and our tours in all the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4046.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we've looked at everything, but I'm not 100% sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4050.026s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as far as I know, the bathrooms in the high school, I wasn't really sure if we've updated them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4054.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've cleaned them and we've painted them, but I mean, is there a plan out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4058.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there something out there that we could really look at the high school ones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4060.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know those have been the ones that have been kind of in the wayside for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5138.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, to go back to that, I would suggest the link only because they change their schedule many times, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5145.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the last thing you want to do is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5149.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's our responsibility for our students, but we also don't want to let our parents go on to like a schedule that we have that all of a sudden the MBTA changes yesterday or the day, you know, and we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5160.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think the link is probably our best bet on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5163.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is I do want to say thank you to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5165.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know I called you for a few things and you took care of that, the particular routes very quickly for us and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5174.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is basically going back to the telephones and that is, I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5180.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: where I work, it's very difficult sometimes because people do change their cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5185.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because some people change it because they just get rid of one and they go into another depending on the plan they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5192.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess especially for the high school, and Dr. Perla, you're here, not to put you on the spot, but I think it would also be good if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5200.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents knew that if they were changing their telephones, or their numbers, or their emails, that they don't have to wait just for that form at the beginning of the year, or a form at the end of the year, because there are different things that happen during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5216.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: someone could lose their phone and they're borrowing someone else's phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5219.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's important that the responsibility is definitely on us, and I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5224.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I also know that it's very important that if a parent does change their telephone number, if there's a different number that they want us to contact, that they really do need to have that communication with the high school, the vocational school, to let us know what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5240.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know if it would be involved in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5242.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that something that we could go on to school brains for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5250.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because the parents can't go on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5252.473s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents can go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5253.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5382.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is that yes, we have school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5385.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, everybody's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5386.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I shouldn't say everyone's working on it because there are parents that feel comfortable on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5390.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's parents that don't feel comfortable on it and that's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5393.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With time, hopefully it gets better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5395.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, not everyone has access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5398.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want the word to be out there that yes, we have the school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5401.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, you could go on with a click.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5402.818s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if you just happen to be going to work and you just have that two minutes waiting for a bus, that you want to contact the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5411.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Contact the school, let them know that you're updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5414.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: telephone number is and that way hopefully we can get the communication on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5419.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is too is the robocalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5422.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know as a parent and my kids were in the school system, I got them all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5427.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee member, I'd still like to be on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6505.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6506.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6508.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know emotions are getting high and for every right, but the thing is that I guess I'm looking at this in different ways and that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6517.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not waiting or just personally as a school committee member, I'm not waiting on just what the superintendent is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6526.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: At this point in time, we're talking about legal papers with laws and rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6531.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That is why we have our legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6534.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That is why we made sure today that Mr. Greenspan would speak to your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6539.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess my question is, is that you're saying that it doesn't say the North Reading School or North Andover School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6547.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it does say, with consideration resolving issues and pending, and you and your partner come to a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6558.474s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I ask at least what your partner wants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6561.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does she want them in North Andover?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6565.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, X, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6567.719s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6592.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so then I guess at this point in time, if our hands are tied, then could I ask Mr. Greenspan, is it possible, I know that you were working or speaking to their attorney, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6604.184s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It depends, I guess, on how you're reading this letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6606.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is there any way that you could call, I mean, I don't know, the Attorney General or someone just to find out what the clarification on this is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6617.073s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the bottom line is this is how it is being interpreted and this is how we have to abide by because it's a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6698.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just basically that and I do think that it would probably be a good idea for you to do it so that way at least the parents really you know and we ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6712.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if there's any type of loophole that even temporarily, if that's something that would be agreed upon, at least we could do something so the children don't stay out of school all this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6722.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in also a confirmation for us that if it's something that we really can't touch because of the law and the way it's written, at least it will confirm on our side too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6746.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, but with all due respect, because there is a rule saying where you lay your head, and it is very specific that it's knowledge that the children are here five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6758.632s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's nothing for them to make a decision on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6761.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're not in their city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6763.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is the reason why they can't even make a decision for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6767.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a mute decision because there's nothing for them to make a decision on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6778.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, do I have the kids going, I mean, for the time being at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7359.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7364.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Looking over the changes, I have to be honest, the one that I don't mind any of the other changes, and I totally understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7372.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I was on the site council when a lot of this was changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7377.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the one I do have a hard time with, and I hear that students are doing it, whatever, so let's continue doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7385.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the rule was that you couldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7387.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, they may be used in hallways during passing time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7395.209s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The hallways are crowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7397.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And having these students on their phones just trying to like go from one class to another plus being on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7404.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I get that they were, you know, you hear people say, well, they do it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7408.556s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, the fact remains is that they weren't supposed to do it in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7413.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That they may be used during the lunch periods in designated student areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7416.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally understand that because as you mentioned, not all students sometimes are in the cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7422.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they are in different places, and I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7424.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a problem with the one that the students could just be walking around during class time in between going from class to class and being on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7433.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also am worried about their safety issues, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7436.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, going up and down stairs, I see it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7438.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I see adults doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7440.712s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'll be driving, and they're just walking and talking and not even paying attention to where they're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7445.194s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I have to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7446.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one about using it in the hallways during passing time, I have a problem with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7950.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7951.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7952.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The clarification on this was that it wasn't that I don't know that things are changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7957.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know me well enough that I've advocated a lot sitting at the meetings that we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7963.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7964.637s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to allow our students to use the phones in between classes, and if it's because of scheduling or looking at schedule because it's easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7973.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We all know our kids right now, they come out of the womb with the cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7976.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We know that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7978.245s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not foolish enough to say that every child in the school does not use their phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7982.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that, I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7984.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I'm concerned with is when you're saying using the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7988.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you saying that you're going to be using the phone and allowing them to take it out so they can know what class they're going to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7993.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some kids might even put a diagram so they know exactly where the classes are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7997.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's easier for them than the map we provide in the back of our handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8003.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern is students walking around while they're trying to get their things out of the locker, and they're all walking around with their cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8065.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think that has to be clarified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8066.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because when I said safety, that's what I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8069.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you're on a crowded staircase, and you're going down the stairs, and you're holding books or whatever, and you're making a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8075.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because this does not say they may be used in a hallway during passing time only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8080.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Excluding phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8087.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it says excluding phone calls, then I have no problem with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8090.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it doesn't say excluding phone calls, then there's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8943.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't know what was, I don't have it in front of me to compare what was on it before and what isn't on it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8949.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, I like the idea because we have discussed, we have to make sure that everybody is on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8955.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's important, especially when the kids are going from the middle school to the high school and to the elementary schools to the middle schools that everybody knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8963.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess my thing, I was reading a few of these things and like anything else,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8969.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know teachers have a lot to do and it's difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8973.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know administrators have the same type of responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8976.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only thing I guess for me is that if we're implementing this, if we're putting it out there, we have to make sure that we abide by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8985.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we're putting it out there, that means everyone is going to abide by it and it's not going to be like, gee, I could go through this hallway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8991.873s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so and so doesn't see me, and I could go through the other hallway where I know someone's going to see me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8996.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that everyone's on board with this as far as, it says here, I don't mean to pick on the high school, but I know it has been done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9005.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That if a student will be provided a school issued suitable item of clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9011.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9015.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if we're looking at our students, we as adults have to be their examples too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9020.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm just putting it out there that everybody should be very well-weared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9026.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're asking our students to wear certain clothing, then we ourselves should be wearing the same and not wearing one thing or saying one thing and showing the students something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11016.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11019.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't actually went upon that one, but I'm concerned about the GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11024.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as my colleagues just mentioned it, I think that the GPA part of this really needs to be, we need to sit down, clarify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11034.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a huge impact on parents and students on both ends, whether your GPA is high or low or in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11043.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really need to clarify it because, I mean, I was reading this and I totally understand on certain things, but I don't want to go from one extreme to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11052.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're saying that we're not going to maybe do the GPA the way it is, but it's important for parents to understand, is this something that's going to impair our students that are going to go on to higher education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11066.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want parents thinking that if we're going to change our system, it's going to impair their children when they go off to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11076.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're all on the same page, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11078.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I just don't want to turn around now and hear, OK, we're going to be doing it in one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11082.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then they go to apply in a totally different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11086.019s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, with all due respect and everything, I'm looking at this, and it says, you know, problems with the GPA are concerns of high-achieving students and their parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11095.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Time spent resolving them is time spent not helping the school's lower-achieving students who already don't value GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11105.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want that message to go out thinking that we're only going to be now concentrating on one group rather than concentrating on all the groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11114.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's just as important it is to make sure that our educational gap gets closer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11119.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to make sure that we put out the correct information and that we're doing the correct thing of making it closer, not just changing the GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11129.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know the next thing that's going to come out of this, if people start reading it, and students start reading it, we're going to be almost in the same situation of what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11137.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz said at the beginning of this meeting, and that is, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11142.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to start taking away valedictorians?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11144.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to start taking away certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11146.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if that's the case, and if that is a culture that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11150.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: this school and this district is going to do, it has to be very important that we clarify it and we disclose it and we are transparent about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11159.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to get a phone call in May saying, guess what, in June we're not going to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11165.213s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If that's something that's going to be discussed across this district, and more importantly with the students in this school, I want to make sure that they are very much aware of where we're going to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11175.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think as a school committee, we definitely want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11178.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: how we're going to achieve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11193.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11200.329s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11201.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And definitely have it open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11203.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you going to also have a discussion with parents once this is done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11244.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, and that's exactly what I'm saying, that if parents start reading this, they're going to jump to conclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11251.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want parents to have the fear out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11254.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want the students to have the fear out there, no matter which group or subgroup they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11259.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I said it's very important that we do discuss this the proper way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11263.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And not starting rumors out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11458.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11460.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that the city council meetings, the last few of them, have been done in the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11465.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason that I know that there's been discussion of having it here is because the issues that they've brought at the meeting has brought in a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11473.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's been difficult to have it over there because it's packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11477.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're at a situation where we're not like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11479.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible maybe for us to go back in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11481.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it's a lot more intimate than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11487.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All righty, new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11585.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just before, I just want to say, I just want to congratulate the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11590.959s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Nicole Kieser and her family for her new baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11597.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also for the Nelson and Kieser families, congratulations on them for their grandchild.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11602.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was a nice thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8313.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8323.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did want to address the councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8329.011s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: On Friday, August 11th, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8346.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: While we were all together, all candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the city council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8358.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8364.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8377.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8382.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8390.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8394.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8401.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8407.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8416.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8433.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8435.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if you are all aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8438.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8448.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you all have a copy of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8452.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It should have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8455.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8456.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8456.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8500.779s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I think people changed their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8501.879s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8502.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8502.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8507.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8519.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8524.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that the decision was not made by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8527.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8534.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8548.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided, or we never changed our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8567.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8578.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were not the part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8581.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had never been discussed with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8583.347s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8586.109s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8592.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and on record that I was not for a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9320.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9323.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9326.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9332.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9336.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9343.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9350.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I, on the record, have not received a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9353.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have my phone with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9354.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't receive a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9356.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only reason I was coming up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9358.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday and I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9375.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that is for them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9376.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not trying to eliminate the due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9379.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not trying to take anyone's rights away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9382.386s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to be, you know, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9388.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying I was not informed of it, so I did not want other people to make a decision for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9395.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9399.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9400.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and phoned everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9419.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're absolutely right, but there are other people up here that said that I didn't receive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9823.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9835.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did want to address the councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9840.711s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: On Friday, August 11, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9846.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12 while we were all together all Candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the City Council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9869.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9876.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9889.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9893.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9902.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9906.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9913.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9919.474s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9928.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9945.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9946.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if you are all aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9950.019s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9960.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you all have a copy of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9964.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10012.704s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10013.685s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10014.546s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10019.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10031.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10036.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that the decision was not made by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10039.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10045.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10059.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided or we never changed our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10079.687s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10090.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were not the part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10093.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had never been discussed with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10095.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10097.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10104.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And on record that I was not for a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10832.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10835.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10838.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10843.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10848.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10854.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10862.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I, on the record, have not received a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10864.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have my phone with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10866.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't receive a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10868.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only reason I was coming up was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10877.258s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10886.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that is for them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10888.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not trying to eliminate the due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10891.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not trying to take anyone's rights away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10894.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to be, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10902.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I did not want other people to make a decision for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10906.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10911.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10912.25s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and spoken to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10915.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just going through the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10916.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Move the question, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10931.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10932.389s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But there are other people up here that said the president went to Parliament procedure.<br><br>
