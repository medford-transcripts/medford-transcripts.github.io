    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3872.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3873.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3877.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3886.608s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3894.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But let's call this what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3896.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3901.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, this is not a gender issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3905.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a power issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3908.039s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3921.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3943.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3948.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: $25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3953.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3959.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3975.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3986.109s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're also the same people that said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3990.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3997.832s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4004.859s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4007.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4038.092s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: opportunity to speak what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4061.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4071.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would definitely want to be there but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4074.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4077.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4084.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4088.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4095.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1974.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh yeah, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5569.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5574.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5575.316s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5588.348s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5603.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5611.289s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: your agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5624.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're here for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5627.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5634.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5647.393s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5659.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's try the healing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5661.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5664.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think that what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5666.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sutton represents is tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5669.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5677.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but we need someone to also represent the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5681.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a connection with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5683.372s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5684.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: She walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5686.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The children know that she walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5689.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: She was the smiling face that they saw every morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5693.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5702.196s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5711.18s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5716.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5723.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8345.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, yep, I'm all set, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8349.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually have a couple of questions here, and that is, there's been discussion on two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8356.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is family engagement, and that is how to get your address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8362.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, I'm so sorry, Emery Cugno 871 Felsway Medford mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, you're welcome and I should have known better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8369.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8370.444s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, there were two things that people are talking about and that is one is family engagement and the other one is child engagement, family engagement is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8379.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying one is more important than the other, but I totally understand the engagement that a person has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8385.414s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're only dealing with one teacher most of the time when you're K through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8390.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Once they go to middle school, then there's teams of teachers and high school is the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8395.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a very important issue that I know that there was communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8400.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we had certain apps that we were working with, software programs that we were working with in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8405.861s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if they're still up and going, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8410.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's, as a person listening to this meeting, as a parent, I would get, it seems a little bit nerve wracking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8419.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I do know that if anyone has ever, I mean, I was on the school committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8425.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't remember anybody telling me they couldn't get in touch with their child for an emergency or because their buses had to get switched that day or because someone else was picking them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8436.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They always called<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8437.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the school and the school, whether it be the principal, headmaster, assistant principals, the information always got to the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8448.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't want parents out there thinking that if they don't have iPhones, if they don't have certain, you know, things to connect directly with the child, that they're never going to be able to get a message to their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8463.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that before we open up any more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8468.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Russo said something about pornography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8472.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a school committee member, I think that would be a huge issue that should be discussed and taken care of before emails and more emails are put on our sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8486.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, if people are saying that their children are seeing pornography that's coming to us, or, I mean, please specify and clarify what's going on, because I think it's important that before anybody else adds more onto our service,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8500.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: um, that that really needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9748.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9755.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How did I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9789.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9790.265s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9792.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have to re-say my name and address again, for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9796.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 871-FELSA, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9797.545s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Guzman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9798.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9799.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would just ask that there are protocols and there's policies, but there's also common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9808.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're offering to do a meeting both in person and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9812.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not like you're taking away the possibility of people still watching on Zoom, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9819.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The people in the city, they've been asking and they're all, we all want an in-person meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9827.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not only speaking for myself, I'm speaking for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9832.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to have that opportunity to come in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9837.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some people feel comfortable on Zoom, some people feel comfortable in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9842.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9843.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it's time for people to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9846.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know there's a motion on there saying that maybe you'll wait for your policies and protocols to be looked at and reviewed, but that might even take until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9859.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9861.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Gray mentioned something about September, so I just wanna make sure that we clarify that you guys aren't waiting until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6242.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Emery cuneo at 71 Felsway Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6245.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I wasn't able to come down tonight and I had no intention actually of speaking, however, watching this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6254.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have to say how disheartening I am, not with not with the with the city council but in general, what's going on in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6264.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6266.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6267.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The first thing I really challenged myself and making sure that we'd work on is bullying and the bullying one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6276.867s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the internet, and we had many forums with many people, whether it be students or adults, police chief, police, we had experts from Bridgewater, and really felt better about those, those, not those rallies, those conferences with everybody and those meetings with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6300.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I have to say, I feel like we've gone backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6303.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not the children that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6305.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is the adults that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6309.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, we're the models for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6314.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So what we do, what we say, how we say it, how we act, how we attack people on Facebook or any type of social media, it's something that our kids see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6328.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, I don't plan on speaking on a lot of the things that everybody else has touched upon, but I will speak on a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6336.251s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is one, Gene Barry, Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6341.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether or not you know this person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6345.493s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: which I did and I respected and I still respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6349.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now knowing her rest of the family still have the respect for, but that doesn't make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6356.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The difference is, is that you have a person who has family in the city, who has given a lot to this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6364.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one has the right to speak and throw things out about someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6370.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What kills me is the fact that people that are writing are the ones that are saying we shouldn't act like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6379.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, with that being said, as an Italian, so far now, I've been called a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6388.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been called other names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6391.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Growing up in this city changed a lot of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6396.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: because we became evolved and like we expected to respect everyone, we don't pick and choose which nationality we are going to respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6409.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We respect all nationalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6412.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From an Italian who was bullied when she was in school, where my name was changed because I was an Italian, and over the years finally get respect that we are all being treated equally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6426.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6429.111s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now to hear that if I'm Italian, I need to be quiet or I am now accused as a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6435.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would love to know that if I wrote something like that about someone else from a different type of culture or a different nationality or a different group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6447.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it would've been just thrown under the rug, shoved under the rug, and hey, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6454.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we are going to advocate for diversity, and if we are going to advocate for fairness in this city, it has to start with all nationalities, all cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6471.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6473.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Heard something a few weeks ago, and I know but I think that I'm crazy but The thing that I heard was actually on It was on the Oscars and it was from Mr. Perry who received a humanitarian award and what I loved about what he said, and I truly believe this is that he said<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6499.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We, in our hearts, do not have room for hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6505.757s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We do not have room for hate for Asians, or blacks, or whites, or police officers, or anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6515.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to come to a middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6518.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I believe there's someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6520.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know why I have someone else on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6525.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What we need to do is we need to get the city down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6529.218s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not in the things of what we believe or who believes, but back in the middle to understand what the city's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6539.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm sorry, but I can't see the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6541.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually see someone else on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6545.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what I'm trying to say is we need to come to the middle, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6551.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying because you're here so many years that you have a right to speak above someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6557.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What we're saying is let's talk together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6561.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it seems to me that the groups that are coming in contradict each other because they're treating each other like the ones that they're accusing other groups of being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6572.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6574.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now the latest I heard is for certain people that want to make sure that we, as when we present ourselves at a podium, are not supposed to say that we're lifelong citizens or residents of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6587.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6589.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6591.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have grown up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6592.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have chose to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6595.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have chosen to keep my children and raise my children here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6599.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not a disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6600.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not a leprosy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6602.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6603.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I want to be proud of I am an Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6607.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And yes, I am proud to say that I come from Fredford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6611.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I am not proud of where method is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you hear me now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Man, you can hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I do understand where everyone is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One was from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mostone and the other one is from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my standpoint is that with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: two, three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: precedence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's coming, that should have already been started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the discussion is already should have already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not aware if it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of people go on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3822.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: hold on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3847.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3867.934s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3876.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it wasn't open to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3879.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3880.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3886.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3891.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3903.259s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3921.761s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3933.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The fact remains is who's going to be interviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3938.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the people that apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3940.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who is selecting the applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3943.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen the application before it goes out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3946.657s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3952.843s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3953.703s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I have had a lot of questions of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3957.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: not to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3966.634s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3972.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that is, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6925.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6926.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just getting it ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6932.286s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6936.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I asked a few questions before, and that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6940.211s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6950.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6955.456s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6961.358s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6965.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6970.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, we're talking the priority of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6975.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there are people right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6977.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: on the committee that feel that the name should be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6981.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6996.393s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The change is going to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6997.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't understand why that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7000.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second of all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7002.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7008.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7019.054s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Being involved in the system, I know how much time it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7024.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7029.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How much time is gonna be put into it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7031.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7036.047s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How are you going to put everyone on the same schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7042.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: More importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7052.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7060.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9427.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so if I'm understanding this the correct way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9433.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to take a round of questions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9436.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're going to go and work on the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9439.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then once it's done and you're all finished, you're going to come back to take more questions from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9448.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we're after 8 o'clock now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9450.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we're going to expect you to come back at 10, 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9454.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9456.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second of all is the fact that, you know, everybody keeps on saying everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9461.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think everybody forgets the fact that if everybody had been heard in June, you would have had your 600 signatures against the, I don't want to say against, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9474.375s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: versus the 300 signatures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9476.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my question again, isn't this a mute conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9482.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because everybody keeps on saying that everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9486.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And these questions and concerns from the community started when we finally did hear about what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9494.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, it's just frustrating because I've asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9498.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There have been other people tonight that have asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9501.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And out of respect, it would be nice if we got some type of answer because you still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9508.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't know any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9511.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the comment on process and policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9515.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member, we had many processes and policies, we just didn't throw this up and say in one night, we're going to do this, whether people you know agree or disagree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9527.828s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think that the process, again, you're going to have people against him for this, but this is a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9535.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: community has been speaking, and it seems like tonight that people are asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9540.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There still has not been one person who has stood up and answered any of them or addressed any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9547.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on June 30th, or whatever the day was, those answers to those questions were all answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9556.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee, you're supposed to be representing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9561.527s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Anne-Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9563.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16325.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16327.106s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16328.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Basically, again, we're still at the same position we were four hours ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16333.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have a committee who keeps on telling me that it's not gonna take any time, it doesn't take time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16338.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16340.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to open up our schools to all our elementary schools have to be open in three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16346.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't understand this process this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16349.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And honestly, the members keep on saying that they hear people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16353.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I've been listening to people all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16355.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but no one has addressed the situation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16358.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's like you've heard, but you're continuing on with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16362.864s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're continuing on with everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16364.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have members that are concerned that there might be actors that might be applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16370.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How are they going to distinguish which ones are actors and which ones are not actors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16375.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I am frustrated to the point that I am so disheartened with my school committee, something I cherished very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16385.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to keep on listening to this for the next four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16390.086s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And no one has discussed anything about our school, our kids going back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16394.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as member McLaughlin, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16397.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is not up to the school committee to make the policy of how they're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16401.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have to be involved in that planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16404.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16408.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, this is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16410.363s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one is saying to change your values change your opinion, change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16415.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're just asking, or I'm asking, slow down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16419.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: pick it and do it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16422.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As far as people saying they've heard us, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16425.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because if you listen to what's going on tonight, for the last four hours of participation, you've had both people that are for it and people that are against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16433.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it seems that the people are for it have been listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16437.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the people that are not for it, for whatever reason, everybody has the right to believe what they wanna believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16444.82s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Put the kids first tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16448.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and postponing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16450.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd like to know if the process is gonna be like this to make sure our kids are gonna have proms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16455.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What's the MCAS gonna be like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16457.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be an MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16458.869s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be any type of social break for the kids this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16463.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23094.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just ask the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23095.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23096.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you still going to be taking names of Italian people or people in history with Italian names?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23104.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is that off the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23108.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23111.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, and then what I do ask is that, you know, for some people it's the name, for some people it's what it represents and doesn't represent, and some people believe certain readings that they have read, some have other opinions, but really keep in mind, you know, it's about culture, it's about history, it's about, yes, it's about Italians that did come into the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23140.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and didn't make, made a lot of sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23143.783s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I am an Italian, I understand exactly what the, just, you know, diversity is and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23152.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's not about the Italian name, and that's what I've been hearing tonight, then I really recommend that an Italian name be selected, because it feels as an Italian American, and I truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23166.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: believe this is that it's wiping out a lot of what you know the community stood for, and I understand about the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23175.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know about the diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23176.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know about progress, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23179.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it seems like we've been asking all night to postpone or whatever, and even though people have listened, they haven't heard, and people are gonna get upset that I said that, but at least listen to the fact that we do have more than just a name attached to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23198.82s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more that, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, but there's a lot more that maybe people are not aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23206.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that maybe if they ask the people that live in the city and has doesn't have to be, you don't have to be here your whole life, you don't have to be here 10 months, you don't have to be here a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23215.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying listen, and really understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23220.092s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not just about a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10421.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we all come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14810.72s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, am I all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14813.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14815.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I've been listening to the meeting tonight, and I know you said give me two minutes, but I'm gonna try my best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14822.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been listening to the meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14825.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As some of you might know or not know, I am a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14830.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I try to listen with fair ears and to listen to all sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14837.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It seems like listening to all the subcommittee meetings that you've had, and with the mandate of, let's say, the commissioner, there's a lot on everyone's plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14852.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there has to be a president's, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't get this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14860.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're talking about process, we're talking about priorities and looking at what you have on your plate, you have budgets coming, you have the, you know, you have parents that really don't know if they want to select hybrid if they do want to select hybrid if they want to have their students in school, there's a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14880.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With all due respect, you guys have spent a lot of time on this, but I can guarantee you there's going to be a lot more phone calls from a lot of people right now, asking about the differences between, you know, what they choose what they don't choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14895.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess, from what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14899.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not the fact of, do you want to name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14903.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Don't you want the name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14905.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I'm respectfully asking is asking the school committee and you, the mayor, as the chair, to really consider putting the priority of putting our children back into school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14916.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know you've been working diligently on trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14920.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you have the commissioner of the state of Massachusetts, who is going to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14925.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: putting mandates and putting his own spin on certain things, even though it might not seem fair, it's going to have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14934.773s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And listening to the results of the decrease of the positive COVID tests, I mean, listening to a lot of the people that have already called and made decisions to the school system,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14950.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to let them know if their children are going hybrid and stuff, you do have a lot of positives going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14957.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when the commissioner looks at something like that, he's going to know that here's a city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14963.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: who is going to be positive, and he's going to be putting more pressure on that because the numbers that decrease in COVID are huge as far as the lesser we have, the better opportunity to get back into the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14978.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14980.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I know there's a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14984.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, high passionate people out there for or against this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14990.001s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But honestly, at this point, I really just ask the school committee to please put your priorities intact as far as this just came up the pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15000.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16077.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16078.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So basically, listening to everyone, again, I mean, what everybody's put on the table is extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16085.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally agree about the non-rushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16087.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that even with that being said, there might be members that don't believe that it's a rushed decision, but I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16098.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: member credits for bringing up the no name situation, because I know that that's been out there and people were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16107.147s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, you know it's time is of the essence, and you have so much going on that now you're here this evening, you've already spoken about it, I understand how the rules go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16120.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But now you're going to spend Wednesday night discussing this all over again and going into it in more depth and detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16129.641s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess stepping back and looking at what's going on and what's being asked of from cities and towns all over the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16139.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It just seems that that time that you're spending on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16143.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one is saying that, at least, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16148.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying the priority of the dates and the time that you have and what you need to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16155.231s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16156.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I truly believe that the time should be spent on getting the kids back in school, what the game plan is, how much money is it going to cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16164.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have custodians that are going to have to be cleaning a lot more than what they're doing now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16168.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, what do you have in the budget set aside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16170.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, there's a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16173.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I respectfully just say, you know, it's really to look at your timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=706.537s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=707.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=765.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=766.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=767.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=769.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Minutes for December 11, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=876.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 7.15 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or p.m.?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: P.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=882.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=987.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=988.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=989.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=999.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1006.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1017.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you as a committee have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1023.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1024.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very, we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1038.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1054.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1058.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1060.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1062.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1064.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1065.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1067.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.641s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1075.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1080.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1278.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1279.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1280.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1281.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: DiBenedetto and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1630.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1666.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Skerry just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1673.291s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just want to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1677.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1681.221s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1686.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1695.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1706.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1711.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1714.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1718.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1720.121s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1721.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1724.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1741.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1744.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1749.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1751.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1885.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1944.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1945.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1948.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1949.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He's done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1951.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, we appreciate all that he's done, all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1955.425s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1970.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I should have known better than to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1974.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1976.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're building this for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1978.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So may I interrupt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1982.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1983.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by, uh, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1984.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vander Kloof, I believe it was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1986.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1996.367s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1997.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1999.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Smith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2002.611s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2004.432s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2496.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2505.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2507.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, OK, because we got it approved last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2510.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this is, OK, three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2511.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then, just because it's been such a great program, and already there's been so much going on, at the end of the three years, have they already discussed, like, what the process is going to be, if you're going to be able to reapply for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2525.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are going to be able to reapply, or is this, like, one of those, you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2545.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2551.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2565.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2571.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2574.436s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2576.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2585.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2591.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2594.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2603.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2612.073s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2614.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2617.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2626.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there, because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2634.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here, they're in our center of our square, they're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2640.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2644.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3406.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3407.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3409.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3412.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that we were, that you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3413.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3416.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3423.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3427.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3433.044s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And around the year, they have certain lunches that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3435.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know why, because our kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3437.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3443.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Tell them what you're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3445.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3449.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3451.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3452.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3453.871s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3457.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3731.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my, yes, and my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3738.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3739.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3740.309s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3741.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3744.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3748.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3752.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3755.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, and opening up your mind that for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3760.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3761.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3765.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you know, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3775.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3776.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3779.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3860.511s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3983.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, do you, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to like introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4036.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4037.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4041.528s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And up next is Kayla Malone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4043.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4177.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4186.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4187.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4191.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing, the creative workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4200.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4204.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4208.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4213.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4224.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4235.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4237.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4239.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: play that on our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4241.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.444s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4319.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spock, you had said that you're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4327.55s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4328.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4377.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4378.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4438.698s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4440.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4442.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4443.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4447.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: By Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4448.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4450.166s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4453.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, seven in the affirmative, the report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4461.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4464.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4470.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4476.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4487.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program, is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4492.993s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it, and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford, and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4505.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4508.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4509.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4512.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4513.326s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4517.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4672.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be starting... No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4686.622s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4687.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4691.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4692.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4695.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the way that is, but in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4705.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4713.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4716.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved, or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and saying, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4748.434s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4751.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4752.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4754.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4755.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4756.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4758.837s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4761.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4765.841s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5136.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5153.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5163.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5168.024s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5169.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion passes, and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5172.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you receive and place this report on file?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5174.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5178.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge, I mean, sorry, charge policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5191.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5827.29s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5834.594s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5835.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the amount is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Klooten, and then we'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6275.849s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said, if the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6286.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6291.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6293.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what, and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6300.079s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6311.979s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6315.382s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we have that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6316.984s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But don't approve, make it separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6319.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And don't approve the amount until maybe you could come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6537.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.728s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6574.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6586.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6587.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6588.203s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6590.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6591.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6610.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6611.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6616.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6619.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6621.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6656.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6663.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6664.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6665.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6667.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6670.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6671.865s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6729.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7501.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7578.228s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Someone said I was completely correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7585.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7586.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to you, staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7594.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7596.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7604.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here and sometimes over the years I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7613.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7615.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7617.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7620.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7623.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7628.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7633.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7639.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7645.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free-for-all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7653.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7873.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perola, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7885.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to ask real quick, what are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7892.774s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7911.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7967.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7976.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7978.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7983.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8024.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8037.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8191.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kathy, did you have your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8507.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8626.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8631.653s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8641.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8644.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8646.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8649.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8656.25s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8657.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8660.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about this, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8666.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8668.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8677.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, OK, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8689.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8690.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8694.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8699.701s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8702.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8703.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8851.738s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8864.289s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9259.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9871.496s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9876.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9882.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9892.854s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9896.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9901.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the new member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9903.317s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9907.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9912.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9915.24s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9923.843s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and keep what's important in here, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9928.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9929.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, with that being said, always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9940.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9951.213s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9955.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9956.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the side councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9958.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9960.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9965.699s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9969.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9981.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9982.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9984.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9988.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door and to the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10000.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perrella, really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10008.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10014.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10017.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is she gonna come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10019.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10023.687s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10028.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10031.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10035.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight who probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10045.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10050.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son, Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who has always been there for me to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10060.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10093.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's no more, I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10096.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was the relaxing part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=373.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=374.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=375.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=377.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=389.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=394.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigny, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=404.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=414.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=422.316s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to put that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=446.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=468.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=469.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Put them all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=495.977s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=498.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is everyone's mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=501.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=503.258s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=507.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Move to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=509.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=511.36s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz, you all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=633.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=634.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Scari, motion and the second of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=639.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=663.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=664.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we need a roll call on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=757.936s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to approve the payrolls and place on file have passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=762.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=773.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, report of the committee, which is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=775.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees, committee of the whole meeting, minutes for December 11th, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=885.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 715 AM or PM?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=996.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=998.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1008.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1015.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1019.541s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1026.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you, as a committee, have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1032.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1033.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1042.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1047.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1063.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1066.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1067.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1069.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1071.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1073.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1074.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1076.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.68s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.86s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1084.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1089.184s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1639.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1675.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scottie just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1682.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1686.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1690.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school, but with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1704.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1713.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1715.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see, are we gonna roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1723.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1727.936s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1729.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1730.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1749.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1750.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1753.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1760.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1887.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you could just make sure that during the year you let us know how students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1954.286s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1956.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2005.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2006.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2008.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Schmitt as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2011.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2014.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2505.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2514.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2516.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: first and then just because it's been such a great program and already there's been so much going on at the end of the three years have they already discussed like what the process is going to be if you're going to be able to reapply for it or is it so we are going to be able to reapply or is it like one of those you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time oh okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2547.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're looking for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2554.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2560.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2573.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2580.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2583.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2585.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2594.804s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2600.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2603.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2612.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2621.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2623.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2626.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2635.334s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2637.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2643.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2645.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're in our center of our square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2647.177s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2649.138s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2653.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2655.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3415.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3416.396s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that, and she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3421.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3425.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3432.37s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3436.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3439.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times, and around the year they have certain lunches that they do, and I know it's hard, because our kids are in school, but if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves, tell them what you're there for, and maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3458.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3460.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3461.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did hear about that, and it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3469.34s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many did you steal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3747.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3748.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3749.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3750.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3753.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that, and you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3761.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart and, you know, and opening up your mind that, for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3769.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3770.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3774.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3784.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3785.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3810.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3811.263s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4045.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4046.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4186.653s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4195.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4196.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio stations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4200.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4206.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, the creative workshops, something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4213.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4217.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4222.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4233.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4244.908s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4246.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4247.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we could play that on our station, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4326.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4328.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spocker, you had said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4331.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4335.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4336.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4338.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4339.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4386.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4387.514s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4449.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4450.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4451.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4452.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4454.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4455.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4460.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4461.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4463.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 7 in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4465.063s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4469.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4470.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4471.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4473.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4479.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4485.535s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4496.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4501.944s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4514.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4517.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4518.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4522.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4525.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Christopher Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4677.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4681.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be static?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4693.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4695.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4696.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4700.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval only, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4701.946s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.027s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the way that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.728s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4714.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4722.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4725.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4728.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and say, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4757.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4760.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4761.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4763.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4764.265s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4765.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4767.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4770.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4774.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4940.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5145.719s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5162.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5174.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5175.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5176.95s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5178.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion passes and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5183.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5187.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5200.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5828.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When does this draft have to be accepted by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5836.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5844.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the amount isn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5850.656s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, excuse me, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5852.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5970.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5971.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot and then may I go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess with what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6284.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6288.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6295.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6300.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6302.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6309.131s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6319.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: approve what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government so we have that piece but don't approve, like make it separate and don't approve the amount until maybe you can come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vanderbilt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6567.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6583.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6595.234s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6596.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6597.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6599.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6600.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6621.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6622.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if I may, I should condemn it to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.622s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6630.364s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6665.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6666.733s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6667.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6672.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6674.709s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6676.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6679.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6738.61s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6887.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7130.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7510.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7597.908s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: say thank you to you, the staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7603.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7605.795s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7613.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here, and sometimes over the years, I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7622.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7624.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7626.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7629.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7632.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7637.68s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7642.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7648.775s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7654.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free for all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7662.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7882.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Dr. Peralta, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7895.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to ask real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7897.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7900.514s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7920.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7977.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7985.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right, you have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7992.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion, so it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8033.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8044.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8110.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8118.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The gadget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8119.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The gadget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8120.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we were just passing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8516.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8635.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece, but an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8650.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8653.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8655.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8658.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8665.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8667.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8669.96s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8675.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8677.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8690.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know, I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, okay, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8698.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8699.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8703.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8708.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, this is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8712.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8862.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8863.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.581s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8873.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.118s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9266.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9268.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9556.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you lived in my house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9558.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's like yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9881.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: some time to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9883.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9885.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9891.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9901.86s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9905.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was the new member, and within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9916.946s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9921.248s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9924.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9932.853s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And keep what's important in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9937.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9938.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9941.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9949.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9961.502s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9964.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9965.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the site councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9967.166s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9969.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state, and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9974.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9978.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent, who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9990.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9991.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9993.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9997.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door into the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present, Dr. Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10011.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10017.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10023.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10026.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is she going to come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10028.581s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10032.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10037.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10041.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10044.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight, probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10054.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10059.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who's always been there for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10066.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10068.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But just work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10102.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10105.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a relaxing time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=107.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=108.046s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=734.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=754.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=757.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=764.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=765.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there is something out there, at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=773.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Especially when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=853.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Points of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.794s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.934s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Bonilla?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=856.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=861.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=864.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=876.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=880.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=894.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=900.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=908.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=914.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=931.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=948.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=957.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=959.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=985.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3594.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3601.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3606.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3607.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3614.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3618.891s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3619.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3623.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3624.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3628.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3629.779s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3633.201s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3635.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3643.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3651.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3655.297s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3656.538s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3661.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3664.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3669.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3691.611s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, OK, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3701.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3704.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3706.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3707.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3712.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3714.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3720.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3729.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3733.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3747.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3751.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3855.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3856.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3861.844s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3866.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3874.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3876.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3883.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3885.453s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3888.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3890.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3894.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3918.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or, gee, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3923.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park, I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3930.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3939.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or anything like that, you know, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3944.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3948.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3953.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3955.02s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3961.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3972.149s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3975.733s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3976.794s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3978.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3981.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3988.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, well, gee, do you know what secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3993.069s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3999.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4003.198s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4007.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4009.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4011.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4021.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4022.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4027.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4092.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd be very interested to start doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4095.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4096.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4099.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping, to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4106.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4109.261s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4110.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4127.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4144.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out, because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4151.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4320.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4330.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4335.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4339.993s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, they don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4358.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4359.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5283.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.805s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5286.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into a vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5297.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5298.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5302.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5307.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind and as kids we've been trained in our minds too is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5318.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5319.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5320.637s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5322.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6823.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6824.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6826.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because we won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6830.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I'm going to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6836.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6841.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6855.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy and I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6867.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6873.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6883.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and in English, and I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6886.131s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6927.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6928.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they just come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6942.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, you know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6947.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6951.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6958.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6964.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7637.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7667.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7754.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, at a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8286.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: a clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8309.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8317.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8319.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8321.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8698.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or two months or seven months, they don't even bring it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=99.231s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=725.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=745.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=747.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=749.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=751.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=755.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=759.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: okay let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=862.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=867.209s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=883.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: have to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=891.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=900.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=906.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=922.211s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=931.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=939.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=947.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=953.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=954.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=959.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=962.846s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=964.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The player always wants to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=966.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we as adults have to take responsibility, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=968.927s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=970.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=971.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=972.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=976.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3585.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3592.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3597.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3598.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3600.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3609.949s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3610.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3614.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3615.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3619.334s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3620.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3624.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3626.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3635.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3642.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3652.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3655.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3660.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it for our drama students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3662.859s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not picking on clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3664.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying as examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3666.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3675.979s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3681.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3692.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3695.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3697.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3698.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3702.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We, you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3705.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3711.364s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3720.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3724.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3742.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3744.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, those numbers are very low, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3846.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3848.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3857.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3865.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3867.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3874.31s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3876.471s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3879.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3881.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3885.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3890.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3909.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3914.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3918.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3921.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3939.057s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3943.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3946.044s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3963.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3966.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3967.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3969.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3979.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3984.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3990.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3994.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4000.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4003.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4008.704s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4018.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4085.883s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4087.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4090.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4100.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4101.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4118.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4135.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4151.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4309.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4326.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4328.069s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4330.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4346.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: At least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4348.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4350.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5274.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.277s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5277.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5288.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5292.942s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5304.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5309.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5310.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5311.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5313.188s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6814.955s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Esconia, I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6820.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6821.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6826.24s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6831.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6846.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6850.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6855.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6858.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6864.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6875.032s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6877.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6918.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6919.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6926.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6938.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6942.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6949.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6955.613s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7624.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7628.449s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7629.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7661.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7675.671s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: until after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7745.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed like at an E.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8277.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8278.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8279.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8283.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8290.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8300.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8308.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8310.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8679.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8689.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8699.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What if they don't even bring it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8705.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8319.267s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8341.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8343.253s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be someone else that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8345.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8346.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their cell phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8347.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8349.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8354.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as my colleague said I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8357.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8438.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: points of information they are very.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8441.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to address the street alleys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8445.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The question of the discussion actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8447.432s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In my in my came out with a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8452.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cushion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8453.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Policy and a probably about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8456.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Six years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8459.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8472.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is the coaches have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8474.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Administration has to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8475.927s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The students have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8477.468s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8479.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8484.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nurses the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8493.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: uh... fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8520.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to that trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8521.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Gets evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8523.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Has to go to a doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8525.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8533.877s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8539.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: unless that trainer okays you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8542.481s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8547.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8548.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8553.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8556.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8558.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: player always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8562.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8566.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11180.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11186.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11191.382s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11192.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11199.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11208.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11209.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11213.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11215.001s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11218.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11220.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11229.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11236.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11240.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11241.78s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's happening, you know, for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11246.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like, are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11249.706s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11254.89s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11276.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11286.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around, you know, is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11289.772s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11291.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11292.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, there's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11297.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11300.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11305.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11314.484s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11318.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11332.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11336.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11440.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11442.203s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11447.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11452.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11459.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11461.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11468.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11470.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11473.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11475.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11476.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just because they're not things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11479.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately we have seen situations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11493.894s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: from you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11512.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11529.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11533.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11538.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11539.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11546.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11560.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11561.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11563.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11573.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11578.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11584.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11588.278s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11595.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11597.145s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11606.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11607.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11612.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11679.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11682.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11684.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11688.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11690.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11693.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11694.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11695.95s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11712.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11721.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11729.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11736.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11905.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11916.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11920.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11921.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11924.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11942.634s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11945.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12870.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12882.546s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12883.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12887.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12892.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12895.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12905.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12907.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14409.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14411.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14416.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14421.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14426.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14441.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14449.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14452.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14459.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14469.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14471.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14512.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14513.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14528.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14533.038s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14536.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14544.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15222.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15255.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15339.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, outside of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15871.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15894.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15903.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15904.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15907.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16284.036s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=464.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=466.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, congratulations, Eva.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=468.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=469.706s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually participated in that a few years back, and it was just an amazing, amazing day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=477.729s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you're not involved with it, unfortunately, and we didn't know about it, but I had the opportunity to go down and to see students from all over the state really working together, and what a camaraderie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=489.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for students that really didn't know each other at the beginning of the day to really become very friendly by the end of the day and they were all working really for the cause of a larger community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=500.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I mean it's just amazing and I want to thank you and I also want to thank the other student for representing Medford so well but I have a question for you and that is what is it that you did?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=512.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=519.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.468s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=520.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So come back and let us know what you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=522.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=523.931s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=524.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1459.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What's going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1460.806s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, for Miss Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1464.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1465.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1466.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, my question is, well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to all the veterans that come each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1471.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's been a 17-year program that you've been running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1475.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's been fabulous, because I know the students get a lot out of it, just as much as the veterans do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1479.973s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also, a thank you, if we can, send a letter to Mr. Lindsay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1484.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who's the director of the veterans just to just as it as a thank-you note from us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1489.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the other thing is is that you were speaking of we don't have the veterans anymore from certain errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1494.44s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1495.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I don't know this is just to throw it out there, but Maybe invite like children of the veterans from that era that have heard the stories that still have stories to share and just give an insight to our students from that era and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1570.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1571.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, you're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1572.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also a letter to Mr. Kreatz, who Noah's been an amazing asset to a lot of these programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1579.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And his enthusiasm and his experience, even though he hasn't, thankfully, gone, but he does have a lot of knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1586.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's really nice to see a young student who shares that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1590.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1591.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1640.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Give him some donuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1643.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll give him some donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2327.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But actually there was one part that Mr. Carlo has missed and that is Sandra also said that she does speak Spanish and because she had the opportunity of taking Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2341.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that she fell in love with the language and the culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2344.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that's an important piece, because no matter how many languages we speak as a district, when we have the opportunity, and here I have to say thank you to Cassett, because Cassett is where it starts in the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2357.449s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, and it continues through the middle schools, and it continues to the high school, and it's a great opportunity for Cassett, but also a great opportunity for us, and to thank all the teachers that have always been involved, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3478.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Pugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3479.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3480.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Through you to the superintendent, is there a way for us to find out how the other schools in our area were graded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3494.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But yeah, I'd like to see the list of the surrounding schools and and just in general other schools Yeah, but it doesn't give that information just to see I can get you the rest of it just was a lot of pages No, and I understand that and I'm not asking for the whole report I'm just asking so that way we have an idea of where we rank compared to if it's okay with you What I'll do is I'll pick some area schools and give you you know some comparable type schools like Waltham and Winchester<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3521.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then I guess my other concern is We rate you know according to their standards We rated high does is that jeopardize any type of grant or anything that we're going to be going for because I mean Because we we graded very high based on their requisites I just don't want to jeopardize anything out there that we're waiting for like capital planning money or anything like that I mean are they going to take that into consideration obviously they're going to look at buildings that are for and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3599.696s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And was the tour across the board, like when they came to the high school, did they see the whole high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3606.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the same thing with all the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3625.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want them to say that they went into the science labs at the high school and just assumed that the rest of the school is like that, because it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3636.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Keep on telling them that, because it has to go through the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3641.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4122.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4123.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4125.291s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I have had the opportunity, and I know what people are going to say out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4129.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, you know, the people that always agree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4133.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, my discussion is not about whether I agree or disagree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4139.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4140.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just a thank you for the person that he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4144.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's been many a times that there are a lot of us that agree or disagree, but this is out of respect, out of respect for the gentleman that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4152.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've had the opportunity, not only as a Medford School Committee member, but also as a president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to actually go around the state with Mr. Bellson to see how he has represented us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4166.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: always having us top of the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4171.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know people agree to disagree, but you really don't know it all when you're not behind this reel, unfortunately, because there are a lot of things that it's amazing to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4183.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When I went to the statehouse and there was a discussion and the superintendent went and he testified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4191.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there were other superintendents there that day that were testifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4195.056s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's amazing to see the amount of people that after they're done with their discussion, the reporters and other people from the state house, all those superintendents were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4207.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody went to Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4209.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who did he talk about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4211.443s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: He talked about the people in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4213.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not only the students and the parents, but the teachers and everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4218.527s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't want to talk about agreeing or disagreeing, because that's why we're here, to be respectful behind and in front of the reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4228.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is where you come to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4230.617s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is where you come to express what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4238.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's funny, Paulette just said something about he'll answer that phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4242.621s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: when he's on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4244.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I remember 12 years ago when I started and I wanted to bring the summer program into fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4251.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I remember going to that school the first day, and we had tons of kids there with parents dropping them off, and of course it was the hottest day, and the summer hadn't even started, and the people in charge had shut the air conditioning on me, and I called him, and he answered, and I'm like, I am sorry, but, and I went into a rage, and he's like, don't worry, he's like, the second I get off the plane, because I'm stepping on the plane, he says, I will call, and that air conditioning was on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4281.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's things like that that you remember, but honestly when I've had the opportunity to go around the state and I've had the opportunity nationally to tell people that we've had superintendents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4292.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's amazing, because they say, what do you mean you have a superintendent who's been there all these years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4296.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're lucky if you get someone who stays with you two to three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4299.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4301.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen it in the communities around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4303.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right now, it's very difficult to get someone who's very qualified, because the candidate pool is not that large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4312.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when people tell me you work with a school committee, or you work as a school committee, or you actually speak to your superintendent, again, it seemed very strange to me, because I just assumed this is how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4325.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am in total shock when I hear other school committee members across the state that tell me, what are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4332.146s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What do you mean you have community participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4334.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm like, well, that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4336.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're here for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4337.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They should have participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4339.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4340.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're not allowed to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4342.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so there are things that we just assume as a school committee member, as a parent, as a teacher, administrator, what we're used to sometimes, we're just assuming this is how it is across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4354.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're always complaining about what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4357.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you have the opportunity to go outside your city and to see what other things and other people are doing and other cities and towns are doing, again, there's always improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4366.935s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bar is always raised up high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4368.937s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But to see where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4371.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: is just really, you know, it's, I'm very happy to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4376.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I have to say that it's people like the superintendent who go out there with their passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4382.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and get what we have, because it's not that easy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4385.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4691.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, I just wanted to acknowledge, actually, Mr. John Costas from the Medford Electric for the donation of installations of many of the lights at the Marsha Caron Theatre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4705.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The lighting that he just put in, he donated everything, and the lights that we have now will enhance the stage and the theatre itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4714.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to see if we could invite Mr. Costa for... He does a lot more than just that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4723.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4724.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, this was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4725.685s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4727.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if we could just invite him the next time we have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1135.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1136.011s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you to the Democratic Board Committee and to all of you for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1140.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My name is Ann Marie Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1142.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I graduated and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in foreign languages and in criminal justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1147.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a lifelong resident of Medford, along with my husband, Michael, we were married after graduation, and we've been married for 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1155.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have four sons, and they have all graduated from the Medford public school system, pursuing their careers and education, continuing on their road to success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1164.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been on the Medford School Committee for the past 12 years and served as president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, a position which allowed me the opportunity to work on state and national levels, continuing to represent Medford on discussions of important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1182.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why am I seeking city council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1183.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For the same reason I ran for school committee, to make constructive changes and a positive difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1190.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: During my tenure of the Medford School Committee, I introduced changes and presented fresh ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1196.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Collectively passed many successful programs along with my committee colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1202.479s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We approved and implemented changes ranging from technology to building upgrades and educational programs, some utilizing state and federal grants to underwrite the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1213.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have worked and collaborated with local, state, and federal elected officials, appointed to the state local government committee with both Governors Patrick and Governor Baker,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1224.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Advocated in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1226.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for the Massachusetts Federal Relations Network Delegation, meeting with members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican alike, while always having time to meet with our students, parents and teachers and administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1240.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Replying honestly to all and keeping true to myself, building consensus along the way, and at times agreeing to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1250.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a city councilor, I will bring the same positive changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1254.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We as elected officials need to make the correct, non-partisan decisions on the issues, not based on the party line or a special group, but based on what is beneficial for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1267.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a master plan, but now it is time to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1271.902s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is a lot of discussions about the revitalization of Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1276.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The talk needs to stop, and we need to make it a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1282.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1283.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to take pride in our city by starting with cleanup for all retail squares, such as off hours, trash removal in the retail areas, upgrade the lighting to be brighter and more inviting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1296.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With Chevalier Theatre partnering with Professional Management Company, we have a window of opportunity to make the heart of our city, Medford Square, more appealing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1305.555s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: welcoming upscale stores, art galleries, restaurants, adding affordable housing, a proper city parking facility, and maybe even a movie theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1314.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our neighborhoods also need attention, not only the streets and the sidewalks, but proper planning in our zoning to keep our city a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1324.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Comprehensive plan to repair our streets,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1327.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All the city streets, we need to hold contractors to a higher standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1332.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They need to return our streets to safe and passable ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1336.447s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Anything less is not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1339.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Making our city into the vibrant, exciting and upcoming city it can and it will become, just as the ones around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1348.312s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to incorporate the appeal of our city to all ages, including our children, by giving them an opportunity to want to return to an affordable and vibrant community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1358.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let me ask, what has changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1361.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The amount of land in the square has not shrunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1364.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our family and community values have not vanished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1367.823s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am aware we do not have the amount of land space that other cities have, but with a comprehensive plan, we have enough space to get to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1376.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: By doing so, the other jewels of our city will also benefit, such as Haines Square,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1383.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: West Medford, the Hillside, Wellington, Glenwood, in all our entire city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1389.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Revisit the parking issue, making it sensible for all, providing a more concise and transparent program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1396.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need to be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1398.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Under these circumstances, things will not change over at night, and it will take time, but it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1405.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We cannot afford for discussions to continue based on who to blame instead of going forward in a positive and a productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1413.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am a candidate who votes on the issue, not a promise for the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1418.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am a proven candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1421.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have made changes, not just by talking, but by rolling up my sleeves and getting the work done, which in itself makes me a uniquely qualified candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1431.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Continue bringing new ideas, integrity, hard work, and passion to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1436.196s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It will positively impact our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1439.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I ask for your trust in me and your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=1441.877s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Number 10 on the Medford City ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1514.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1515.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1516.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1517.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1520.457s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1522.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1529.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Westmark, nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1534.105s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1536.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1541.068s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1548.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1572.538s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: my concentration went away, but different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1576.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1591.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have like people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field or, you know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1607.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1611.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's something down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1664.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1679.259s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1684.164s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1688.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1693.594s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue, or if it's something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2745.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2747.948s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2748.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2750.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2761.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2770.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2776.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2782.59s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2788.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I get it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2790.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2792.601s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and then they disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2800.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you now had a different way of thinking about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2825.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2830.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2837.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2840.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2848.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2865.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2871.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2881.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2885.84s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2886.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2892.902s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2894.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2900.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.495s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3390.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also, the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3400.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3403.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3405.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3419.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Brazil,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3427.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3435.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3442.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3449.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3456.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do I have to make a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3457.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3458.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So motion to approve that the superintendent goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3689.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3693.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3697.754s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3705.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3711.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3727.651s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3729.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3756.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3766.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4097.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4098.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4105.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4106.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4108.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5412.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5414.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5415.36s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5417.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5420.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5526.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: even across the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5569.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5821.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5822.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5825.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5836.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5849.484s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5851.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5852.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5859.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5861.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5863.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5866.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5874.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5966.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5970.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5984.499s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5985.48s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5987.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5994.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6003.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6005.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6008.121s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state for our positions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6012.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Roberts Rules of Order, there's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6025.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6027.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6855.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6856.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6882.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6884.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6889.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6923.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so then, but the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6952.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7435.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7471.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we can make sure we put something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7472.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7483.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7486.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7656.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7657.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7665.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I went back and forth with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7711.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7716.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the ninth grade and then all of a sudden the tenth grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7728.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7732.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7736.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7739.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7750.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7757.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7763.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7774.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fair to those students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=7775.959s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fair to anybody, but those students especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=9283.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Every time we look around, we just say, it's a homeless people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=9285.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they have names, they have dreams and paths and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=877.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=878.846s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=879.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=880.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=883.91s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=886.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=893.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Westmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=897.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=900.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=904.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=911.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=936.329s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concentration went away, but different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=939.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=954.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=962.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=966.626s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=970.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=974.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=980.555s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=983.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1027.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1034.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know if there's any time in classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1036.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school, or maybe in a Saturday, or if the business is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1048.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=1052.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue or if it's something they thought they were interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2110.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2111.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2112.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2113.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't a hundred percent sure before we started the meeting and I sat down with you really quick, but I would have asked you a thousand questions because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do is it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2134.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2137.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2140.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2145.967s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2152.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I get it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2153.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2155.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes, and then they disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2164.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have you now had a different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2167.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: way of thinking about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2189.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2194.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2201.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2204.251s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2211.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2228.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2235.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2245.396s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2249.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2256.302s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2258.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2264.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2753.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2763.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2766.923s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2781.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2782.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2799.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2806.257s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2810.298s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2812.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, so I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2817.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, um, with that, do I have to make a motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3056.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3061.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3068.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3075.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3091.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3092.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3120.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3129.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3461.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3468.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3469.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3471.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4775.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4777.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4778.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4781.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4783.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4889.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: even across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=4932.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.549s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5184.729s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5186.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5189.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5199.883s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5207.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5212.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5214.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5215.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5222.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5224.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5226.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5230.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be internships and co-ops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5236.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5237.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5329.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5334.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5347.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5348.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5350.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5357.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5368.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5371.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5374.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5379.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5389.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5390.608s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6219.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, just for a clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6245.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6248.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6252.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6288.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6315.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the Councilors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6798.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6834.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we can make sure we put something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6835.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6846.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=6849.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7019.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7020.243s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7028.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cause I went back and forth with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7074.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7079.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the 9th grade and then all of a sudden the 10th grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7091.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7095.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7099.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7102.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7114.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7120.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=7126.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=886.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=887.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=888.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=889.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=892.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is absolutely wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=894.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=901.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Westmark, nope, I have to get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=905.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've known her before she was married.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=908.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=912.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city that it would really be beneficial I think and speaking to others that I think this would go hand in hand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=926.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: if we're able to put our students into the community and have them have some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=937.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a hotel in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=940.709s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have different types of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=943.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'd like to see, if possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=950.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students, and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=962.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=970.636s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=974.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=979.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields, but if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=988.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=991.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1035.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during the day, because I know they have a lot on their plates and you don't want to lose any time in classes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1044.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school or maybe in a Saturday or if the business is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1051.111s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1056.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to see kids, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1060.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1065.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1069.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and they want to pursue, or if it's something they thought they were interested in and they want to go to a different field altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1074.605s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2118.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2119.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2120.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2122.331s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2133.439s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2142.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so we brought in a lot of forums, not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2147.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2154.337s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, trying to tell<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2156.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: children all the time or anyone just to be careful what you write you know I get it all the time the snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes I want to know from you what have you learned as far as like these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and they disappear have you now had a different way of thinking about that yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2195.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2197.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2202.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2209.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that your peers hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2212.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sometimes, as adults, we'll say it and, oh, no, it's not true, or you don't know about it, or you have no idea about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2219.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2224.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, that was one of the biggest things is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards and the employers are looking into everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2237.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, it has to be something that you really, I hope,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2241.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: will continue bringing to your peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2243.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2252.598s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2257.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2258.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2264.688s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for representing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2266.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for absorbing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2268.401s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2272.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2761.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2762.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2771.835s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's really very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2775.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2782.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2791.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2807.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Petersburg, Istanbul,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2810.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2814.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2821.354s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important that we have representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2825.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And with that, do I have to make a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2829.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2830.278s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So motion to approve that the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3065.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3069.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3077.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent go and Mr. Zizek go, if discussion comes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3085.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: up in as far as what will be done in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3088.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3099.373s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As you said, it's only been four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3101.134s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on that Mr. Azuz will go before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3108.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3115.204s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The teleconference I knew of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3128.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3137.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3469.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Martinello, please, and his family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3476.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3478.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, we're saying thank you to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3480.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We'll save some paper, and we'll say thank you in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4784.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4785.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4786.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4789.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4791.999s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4894.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The 48 teachers that were involved, are they even across the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4922.373s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What have the teachers heard from the students as far as feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4940.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any feedback from parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5192.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5193.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5194.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5195.12s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the co-op employers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5197.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5208.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like, construction doesn't have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5221.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5223.816s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Business, tech, and marketing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5230.565s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and the same thing with the graphic arts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5232.306s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5233.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and the media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5234.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5238.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5239.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be internships and co-ops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5240.411s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5245.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5324.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: To be a delegate or an alternate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5338.301s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5342.326s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5356.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are vendors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5357.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are opportunities on workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5359.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5365.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5377.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more involved than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5379.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5383.142s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for our positions here, the Robert's Rules of Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5387.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5397.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying we don't know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5398.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6225.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6226.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6227.577s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6228.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6254.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So we are down at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6256.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6260.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6296.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6303.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: office was located, which was at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6323.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6329.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the Councilors from the other schools or the BCP from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6337.703s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6806.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6842.651s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As long as we make sure we put something, because I know that there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with the same child or even with older children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6854.614s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least they can get an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.515s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=6857.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7027.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7028.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7035.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or were they granted because we went back and forth with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7082.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7087.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7090.94s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if they're taking these MCAS in the ninth grade, and then all of a sudden, the 10th grade, it changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7096.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7099.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7103.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I mean, I just hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7105.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7107.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know how they change their things overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7110.564s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7114.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th grade and then all of a sudden we change it overnight on them and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=7128.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that because I'm sure, I mean I know the administration does, I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1275.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1277.891s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1282.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1287.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1299.556s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1300.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1306.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work, and it's currently in certain places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1314.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1318.512s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1324.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1331.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1352.142s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: then the parents would come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1355.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1404.938s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1410.063s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1418.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1436.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So why should she have to give on anything, but you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1443.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1453.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1460.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1463.63s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if there's any other, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2039.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2045.102s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, the children could go to school Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2052.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2063.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2074.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2078.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2083.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2085.541s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2111.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get, like, because you said they missed school today, because she didn't want to drop them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2116.772s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is beyond you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4189.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was one of my biggest, it was one of my things on my to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4193.206s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4197.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4202.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has proved itself many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4206.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm very proud of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4210.943s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4211.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5960.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5961.036s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5976.679s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5979.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5992.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here, what's happened is we've kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5999.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it's always an option, maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that, we've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses, we have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school really to the max,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6028.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you kind of do want to leave I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood But parents have actually opted to stay within the system or within their district I should say within their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6041.64s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's say in a larger in a larger way when it came to the middle school it was always more of a choice and I think that's how that's the reason we've gone that way and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6051.006s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's gonna camp it's together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6053.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advise parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6065.614s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6074.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6079.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6085.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6095.294s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1043.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1045.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3978.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3978.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5727.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5728.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5743.922s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5747.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5759.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5764.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what's happened is we've kind of, it's always an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5768.84s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored like the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5782.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5788.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5793.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: really to the max, and you kind of do want to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5798.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood, but parents have actually opted to stay within the system, or within their district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5806.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I shouldn't say district, within their neighborhood, let's say, in a larger way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5811.046s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When it came to the middle school, it was always more of a choice, and I think that's the reason we've gone that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5818.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they sit on a campus together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5820.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5832.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5841.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5847.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5852.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5862.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=8424.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1044.511s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1049.412s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1052.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1066.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1067.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm reading this and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1073.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1077.661s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1078.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's currently in certain places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1080.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1085.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1091.39s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there So two days a week no, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us That's on the documentation so what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know we want to we want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1110.283s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Understand where you're coming from but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford Then the parents would come to an agreement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1122.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1163.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities and towns that the other parent is willing to move to, including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield, and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1176.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not going to move out of there, or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1185.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1187.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1205.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading or Wakefield or Reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1209.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, but what I'm saying is that, I'm just going by what you're saying, and that is that even if we opened up Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1215.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: According to the documentation that you have given us from the court<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1219.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1227.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1230.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if there's any other, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1234.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's the motion, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1804.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could I follow up on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1806.835s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1808.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we first spoke, and up until just a little while ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1811.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, because the children could go to school Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1818.658s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1820.139s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, well, five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1826.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Every week, since March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1827.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1829.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, but there's... So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1841.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1844.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1850.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1852.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1877.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1880.331s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because she said they missed school today because she didn't want to drop them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3955.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was one of my things on my to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3959.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3963.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3968.738s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it has proved itself many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3972.862s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm very proud of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3978.006s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5726.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5727.419s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5743.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we also did it in a phase way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5817.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's on a campus together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5819.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5831.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5840.701s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean we've had situations because our children some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn middle school Their children stayed in the McGlynn elementary school because that's it was a better thing for them But I mean I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized That there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved too But with that being said if parents have called they have been given that choice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=723.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Over the years, that's been something that we've always, as a committee, we've discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=728.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That we have a jewel in this city, that we do have a vocational school, and we do have a high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=734.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The goal was, and as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=736.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz has pointed out, the goal was is to give the opportunities to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=742.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether they go over to the vocational side or our students from the vocational side go over to our high school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=749.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But as far as the changes that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=751.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz is discussing tonight, I have to say I'm really surprised because with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=757.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The changes, we also made it very clear that we understood the codes that need to be changed because of the laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=764.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we also knew the uniqueness of this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=767.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so listening to all of a sudden the ranking being changed and no valedictorian and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=776.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Those are things that are very, very concerning, not only as parents or school committee members, but take us out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=782.112s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Think of the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=783.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Think of the students that are, especially students that are juniors and seniors this year, that have been thinking of this their whole entire time that they've been up at the high school or have heard of the high school and what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=794.041s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to go down an avenue to make, bless you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=798.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to go down an avenue that takes us that way, this is, as you just mentioned, we are going to have the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=806.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually second Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=807.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cress' motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=809.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It has to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=810.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We can't just expect our students to come in in September and all of a sudden everything changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=815.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to be changing these things, we need to figure out which ones that need to be changed gradually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=822.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Let's grandfather the students that have been pertaining to this, that it pertains to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=827.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If this is something that we're going to change as far as the valedictorian or the grades or our guidance Councilor being on the other side of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=835.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: These are things that need to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=836.761s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It can't be discussed or just written in a letter and just sent home or just told on a morning that our students are coming to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=843.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=845.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I am happy that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=882.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, I just want to say again, we've already discussed that we're going to have to have a committee of the whole make it really clear out there to our parents and our students are teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=893.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that before, I mean, all this is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=895.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really need to have a discussion, and it has to be an open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=899.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are things that are going on in the school system that, you know, we don't know, that maybe parents are not aware of, so the discussion has to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=907.753s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I hope that parents, you know, come to the table, and students come to the table, bringing their concerns, and we could really have a discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=916.335s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because again, the whole point of really going forward with this was the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=921.617s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have a jewel, it is a very different type of situation and thrilled that especially our vocational students have the opportunities because a lot of them are going off to college that have the same type of opportunities and they're not taking night courses and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=935.161s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in the same way, we have to be sensitive in making sure that we're not taking everything away from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=941.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=942.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van De Kloet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1421.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1422.62s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So James R. Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, to go back on the report that the superintendent just read off,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1959.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague actually mentioned just a little while ago, just to go back real quick on the high school and vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1966.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do urge that we have the committee of the whole sooner rather than later, because there has been tremendous work done by all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1978.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want the information that we got out tonight to really impair that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1984.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So instead of having rumors and things going around like wild and rampant, I really do hope that we can have this meeting of a whole as quickly as possible so that way we can work on this and that we can discuss what really is going on and what changes are going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2002.673s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is I was just looking at the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2006.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that when we were looking at it, at budget time there was approximately 50 students, more at the Andrews than the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2013.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I thought we were going to try to work something out to maybe even that out a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2017.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So there could be some clarification on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3918.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3919.606s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, I apologize if any of my colleagues have already said this, but it's kind of hard to hear a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3927.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that the discussion came up with bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3930.692s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not sure which schools we were talking about or if we were discussing- That was the kids' corner bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3947.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I know in the past couple of years we've actually concentrated on the elementary schools, the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3953.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not 100% sure if we've done anything really big in the high school bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4031.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4032.51s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't know if it's the microphones, the speakers in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4035.493s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It sounds loud out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4036.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4038.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very muffled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4040.018s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know, as far as the high school ones, because I know that when we've taken our walks and our tours in all the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4046.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we've looked at everything, but I'm not 100% sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4050.026s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as far as I know, the bathrooms in the high school, I wasn't really sure if we've updated them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4054.148s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we've cleaned them and we've painted them, but I mean, is there a plan out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4058.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there something out there that we could really look at the high school ones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4060.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know those have been the ones that have been kind of in the wayside for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5138.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, to go back to that, I would suggest the link only because they change their schedule many times, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5145.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the last thing you want to do is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5149.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's our responsibility for our students, but we also don't want to let our parents go on to like a schedule that we have that all of a sudden the MBTA changes yesterday or the day, you know, and we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5160.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think the link is probably our best bet on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5163.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is I do want to say thank you to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5165.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know I called you for a few things and you took care of that, the particular routes very quickly for us and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5174.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is basically going back to the telephones and that is, I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5180.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: where I work, it's very difficult sometimes because people do change their cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5185.167s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because some people change it because they just get rid of one and they go into another depending on the plan they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5192.392s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess especially for the high school, and Dr. Perla, you're here, not to put you on the spot, but I think it would also be good if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5200.958s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents knew that if they were changing their telephones, or their numbers, or their emails, that they don't have to wait just for that form at the beginning of the year, or a form at the end of the year, because there are different things that happen during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5216.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: someone could lose their phone and they're borrowing someone else's phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5219.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's important that the responsibility is definitely on us, and I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5224.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I also know that it's very important that if a parent does change their telephone number, if there's a different number that they want us to contact, that they really do need to have that communication with the high school, the vocational school, to let us know what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5240.595s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know if it would be involved in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5242.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that something that we could go on to school brains for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5250.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because the parents can't go on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5252.473s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents can go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5253.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5382.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is that yes, we have school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5385.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, everybody's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5386.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, I shouldn't say everyone's working on it because there are parents that feel comfortable on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5390.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's parents that don't feel comfortable on it and that's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5393.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: With time, hopefully it gets better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5395.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, not everyone has access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5398.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want the word to be out there that yes, we have the school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5401.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, you could go on with a click.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5402.818s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if you just happen to be going to work and you just have that two minutes waiting for a bus, that you want to contact the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5411.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Contact the school, let them know that you're updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5414.743s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: telephone number is and that way hopefully we can get the communication on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5419.588s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is too is the robocalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5422.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know as a parent and my kids were in the school system, I got them all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5427.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a school committee member, I'd still like to be on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6505.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6506.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6508.064s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know emotions are getting high and for every right, but the thing is that I guess I'm looking at this in different ways and that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6517.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're not waiting or just personally as a school committee member, I'm not waiting on just what the superintendent is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6526.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: At this point in time, we're talking about legal papers with laws and rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6531.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That is why we have our legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6534.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That is why we made sure today that Mr. Greenspan would speak to your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6539.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess my question is, is that you're saying that it doesn't say the North Reading School or North Andover School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6547.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it does say, with consideration resolving issues and pending, and you and your partner come to a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6558.474s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I ask at least what your partner wants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6561.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does she want them in North Andover?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6565.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, X, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6567.719s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6592.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so then I guess at this point in time, if our hands are tied, then could I ask Mr. Greenspan, is it possible, I know that you were working or speaking to their attorney, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6604.184s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It depends, I guess, on how you're reading this letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6606.366s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is there any way that you could call, I mean, I don't know, the Attorney General or someone just to find out what the clarification on this is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6617.073s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the bottom line is this is how it is being interpreted and this is how we have to abide by because it's a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6698.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: just basically that and I do think that it would probably be a good idea for you to do it so that way at least the parents really you know and we ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6712.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if there's any type of loophole that even temporarily, if that's something that would be agreed upon, at least we could do something so the children don't stay out of school all this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6722.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But in also a confirmation for us that if it's something that we really can't touch because of the law and the way it's written, at least it will confirm on our side too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6746.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, but with all due respect, because there is a rule saying where you lay your head, and it is very specific that it's knowledge that the children are here five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6758.632s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There's nothing for them to make a decision on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6761.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're not in their city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6763.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is the reason why they can't even make a decision for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6767.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a mute decision because there's nothing for them to make a decision on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6778.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, do I have the kids going, I mean, for the time being at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7359.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7364.117s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Looking over the changes, I have to be honest, the one that I don't mind any of the other changes, and I totally understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7372.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I was on the site council when a lot of this was changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7377.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the one I do have a hard time with, and I hear that students are doing it, whatever, so let's continue doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7385.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the rule was that you couldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7387.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is, they may be used in hallways during passing time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7395.209s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The hallways are crowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7397.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And having these students on their phones just trying to like go from one class to another plus being on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7404.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I get that they were, you know, you hear people say, well, they do it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7408.556s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, the fact remains is that they weren't supposed to do it in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7413.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That they may be used during the lunch periods in designated student areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7416.901s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally understand that because as you mentioned, not all students sometimes are in the cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7422.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And they are in different places, and I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7424.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a problem with the one that the students could just be walking around during class time in between going from class to class and being on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7433.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also am worried about their safety issues, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7436.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, going up and down stairs, I see it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7438.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I see adults doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7440.712s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'll be driving, and they're just walking and talking and not even paying attention to where they're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7445.194s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I have to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7446.995s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The one about using it in the hallways during passing time, I have a problem with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7950.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7951.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7952.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The clarification on this was that it wasn't that I don't know that things are changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7957.57s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know me well enough that I've advocated a lot sitting at the meetings that we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7963.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7964.637s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to allow our students to use the phones in between classes, and if it's because of scheduling or looking at schedule because it's easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7973.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We all know our kids right now, they come out of the womb with the cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7976.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We know that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7978.245s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not foolish enough to say that every child in the school does not use their phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7982.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that, I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7984.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I'm concerned with is when you're saying using the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7988.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you saying that you're going to be using the phone and allowing them to take it out so they can know what class they're going to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7993.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some kids might even put a diagram so they know exactly where the classes are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7997.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's easier for them than the map we provide in the back of our handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8003.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern is students walking around while they're trying to get their things out of the locker, and they're all walking around with their cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8065.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think that has to be clarified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8066.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because when I said safety, that's what I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8069.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When you're on a crowded staircase, and you're going down the stairs, and you're holding books or whatever, and you're making a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8075.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because this does not say they may be used in a hallway during passing time only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8080.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Excluding phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8087.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it says excluding phone calls, then I have no problem with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8090.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if it doesn't say excluding phone calls, then there's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8943.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't know what was, I don't have it in front of me to compare what was on it before and what isn't on it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8949.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, I like the idea because we have discussed, we have to make sure that everybody is on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8955.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think it's important, especially when the kids are going from the middle school to the high school and to the elementary schools to the middle schools that everybody knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8963.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess my thing, I was reading a few of these things and like anything else,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8969.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know teachers have a lot to do and it's difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8973.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know administrators have the same type of responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8976.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only thing I guess for me is that if we're implementing this, if we're putting it out there, we have to make sure that we abide by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8985.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we're putting it out there, that means everyone is going to abide by it and it's not going to be like, gee, I could go through this hallway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8991.873s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so and so doesn't see me, and I could go through the other hallway where I know someone's going to see me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8996.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that everyone's on board with this as far as, it says here, I don't mean to pick on the high school, but I know it has been done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9005.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That if a student will be provided a school issued suitable item of clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9011.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9015.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if we're looking at our students, we as adults have to be their examples too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9020.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm just putting it out there that everybody should be very well-weared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9026.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're asking our students to wear certain clothing, then we ourselves should be wearing the same and not wearing one thing or saying one thing and showing the students something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11016.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11019.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't actually went upon that one, but I'm concerned about the GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11024.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as my colleagues just mentioned it, I think that the GPA part of this really needs to be, we need to sit down, clarify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11034.08s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a huge impact on parents and students on both ends, whether your GPA is high or low or in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11043.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really need to clarify it because, I mean, I was reading this and I totally understand on certain things, but I don't want to go from one extreme to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11052.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we're saying that we're not going to maybe do the GPA the way it is, but it's important for parents to understand, is this something that's going to impair our students that are going to go on to higher education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11066.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want parents thinking that if we're going to change our system, it's going to impair their children when they go off to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11076.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're all on the same page, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11078.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I just don't want to turn around now and hear, OK, we're going to be doing it in one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11082.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then they go to apply in a totally different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11086.019s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, with all due respect and everything, I'm looking at this, and it says, you know, problems with the GPA are concerns of high-achieving students and their parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11095.287s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Time spent resolving them is time spent not helping the school's lower-achieving students who already don't value GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11105.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want that message to go out thinking that we're only going to be now concentrating on one group rather than concentrating on all the groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11114.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's just as important it is to make sure that our educational gap gets closer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11119.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to make sure that we put out the correct information and that we're doing the correct thing of making it closer, not just changing the GPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11129.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know the next thing that's going to come out of this, if people start reading it, and students start reading it, we're going to be almost in the same situation of what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11137.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz said at the beginning of this meeting, and that is, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11142.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to start taking away valedictorians?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11144.162s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we going to start taking away certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11146.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if that's the case, and if that is a culture that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11150.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: this school and this district is going to do, it has to be very important that we clarify it and we disclose it and we are transparent about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11159.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I don't want to get a phone call in May saying, guess what, in June we're not going to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11165.213s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If that's something that's going to be discussed across this district, and more importantly with the students in this school, I want to make sure that they are very much aware of where we're going to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11175.058s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think as a school committee, we definitely want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11178.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: how we're going to achieve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11193.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11200.329s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11201.169s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And definitely have it open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11203.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you going to also have a discussion with parents once this is done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11244.817s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, and that's exactly what I'm saying, that if parents start reading this, they're going to jump to conclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11251.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want parents to have the fear out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11254.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I don't want the students to have the fear out there, no matter which group or subgroup they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11259.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that's why I said it's very important that we do discuss this the proper way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11263.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And not starting rumors out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11458.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can I just ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11460.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that the city council meetings, the last few of them, have been done in the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11465.272s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason that I know that there's been discussion of having it here is because the issues that they've brought at the meeting has brought in a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11473.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's been difficult to have it over there because it's packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11477.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're at a situation where we're not like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11479.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible maybe for us to go back in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11481.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because it's a lot more intimate than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11487.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All righty, new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11585.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just before, I just want to say, I just want to congratulate the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11590.959s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Nicole Kieser and her family for her new baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11597.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also for the Nelson and Kieser families, congratulations on them for their grandchild.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11602.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was a nice thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8313.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8323.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did want to address the councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8329.011s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: On Friday, August 11th, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8346.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: While we were all together, all candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the city council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8358.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8364.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8377.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8382.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8390.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8394.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8401.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8407.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8416.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8433.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8435.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if you are all aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8438.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8448.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you all have a copy of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8452.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It should have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8455.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8456.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8456.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8500.779s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I think people changed their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8501.879s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8502.179s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8502.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8507.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8519.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8524.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that the decision was not made by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8527.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8534.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8548.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided, or we never changed our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8567.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8578.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were not the part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8581.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had never been discussed with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8583.347s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8586.109s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8592.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and on record that I was not for a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9320.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9323.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9326.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9332.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9336.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9343.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9350.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I, on the record, have not received a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9353.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have my phone with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9354.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't receive a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9356.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only reason I was coming up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9358.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday and I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9375.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that is for them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9376.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not trying to eliminate the due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9379.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not trying to take anyone's rights away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9382.386s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to be, you know, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9388.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying I was not informed of it, so I did not want other people to make a decision for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9395.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9399.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9400.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and phoned everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=9419.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're absolutely right, but there are other people up here that said that I didn't receive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9823.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9835.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I did want to address the councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9840.711s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: On Friday, August 11, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9846.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12 while we were all together all Candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the City Council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9869.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9876.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9889.176s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9893.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9902.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9906.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9913.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9919.474s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9928.098s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9945.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9946.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if you are all aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9950.019s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9960.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you all have a copy of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9964.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10012.704s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10013.685s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10014.546s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10019.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10031.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10036.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that the decision was not made by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10039.19s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10045.956s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10059.98s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided or we never changed our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10079.687s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10090.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were not the part of that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10093.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had never been discussed with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10095.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10097.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10104.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And on record that I was not for a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10832.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10835.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10838.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10843.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10848.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10854.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10862.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I, on the record, have not received a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10864.819s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have my phone with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10866.282s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't receive a text message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10868.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only reason I was coming up was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10877.258s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10886.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that is for them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10888.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not trying to eliminate the due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10891.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not trying to take anyone's rights away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10894.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to be, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10902.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I did not want other people to make a decision for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10906.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10911.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10912.25s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and spoken to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10915.013s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just going through the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10916.314s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Move the question, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10931.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10932.389s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But there are other people up here that said the president went to Parliament procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3373.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just as one can remember I'd like to see more parent involvement in kids education Okay, miss miss Cugno Yeah, just points of information on this site councils Some of the schools actually if I'm not mistaking it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3387.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't know if it was all the elementary schools It's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3392.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They have some type of almost I don't want to say an election, but they do have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3398.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the letters that go out to the parents, asking if they are interested in joining, and then if they do get too many parents, because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils, that that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3418.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Over the years, I have been involved, and so I know that that's how it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3423.742s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3426.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And in the high school vocational side, I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3439.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, depending on people's schedules too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the high school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3450.032s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was just point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5001.648s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5001.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5002.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5003.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5004.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nelson, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5006.232s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5009.394s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to go over some of the summer school things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5012.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's $250 for a Method student, $300 for outside students, but is that for all students even if they're taking the online courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5023.626s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5026.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5026.952s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether they're taking it online or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5029.373s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5030.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5038.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5044.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5132.754s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5139.557s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many students did we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5237.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5238.227s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5349.778s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5350.158s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other, my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if, you know, other people do have that accessibility,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5363.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5368.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my question is too is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5419.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and you, and one last question was that you have, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5426.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are those the same courses that are going to be provided this year or are you going to add more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5437.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5642.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6254.835s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6254.935s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6260.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3855.284s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3856.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3856.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3858.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, just points of information on the site councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3862.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some of the schools actually, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if it was all the elementary schools, it's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year, they have some type of almost, I don't want to say an election, but they do have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3875.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The letters that go out to the parents asking if they are Interested in joining and then if they do get too many parents because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils That that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school over the years I have been involved I've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3898.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I know that that's how it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3900.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools and in the high school vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3905.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5492.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But is that for all students, even if they're taking the online courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5506.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is is that Do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5515.424s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like how many students do we get back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5518.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For let's say high school 101 the students entering grade 9 from from what I understand You don't have to have a particular grade in that it's open to anyone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5609.643s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5616.424s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many students did we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5714.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5826.665s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5827.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5836.869s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because now if other people do have that accessibility,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5840.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5845.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my question is, too, is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5896.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5896.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you, my last question was that you have, um, you have introductory physics, chemistry and biology online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5903.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are those the same courses that are going to be provided this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=5905.805s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are you going to add more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6731.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6731.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6736.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3923.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3924.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3925.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3926.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, just a point of information on the site councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3930.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Some of the schools actually, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if it was all the elementary schools, it's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year, they have some type of almost, I don't want to say an election, but they do have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3943.655s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the letters that go out to the parents, asking if they are interested in joining, and then if they do get too many parents, because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils, that that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3963.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Over the years, I have been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3966.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so I know that that's how it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3968.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools and in the high school vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3973.29s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3978.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3984.351s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, depending on people's schedules, too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the high school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3994.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was just point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3997.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3997.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5546.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5546.698s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5547.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5548.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5548.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nelson, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5551.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5554.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to go over some of the summer school things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5557.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's $250 for a method student, $300 for outside students, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5561.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that for all students, even if they're taking the online courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5571.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, whether they're taking it online or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5574.936s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5583.319s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5589.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: From what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5886.071s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: products some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too because we just don't want them sitting there obviously Right and the other my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if you know other people do have that accessibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=5908.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're failing because now they're falling behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6187.495s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6574.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6799.613s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6799.713s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6805.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All righty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=332.754s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=334.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen, to you and to your staff for being involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=339.116s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=345.657s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think there's a huge lesson here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=347.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is just, it's an incredible story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=350.278s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=351.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=357.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We had two people in our own city that lived very modestly and have now given, you know, they were over, like, the modest life yields, $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=370.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's a huge lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=372.286s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the lesson I hope that our students get from this and for everyone, actually, that listens is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=381.49s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to read the story, it was just a fabulous story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=383.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually shared it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=385.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: today with some people that I work with, and they said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=404.258s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is something really tremendous, but I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=598.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=600.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=601.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you again, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=602.805s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen, for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=604.327s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, extremely proud of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=609.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=616.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=617.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=622.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=626.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=643.935s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Medford students are all going to this school or that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=649.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not saying that one school is better than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=652.284s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=657.689s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when I, when we approached it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=660.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: we said it's not fair to the students because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=672.79s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important for the school but also for the students to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1412.738s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1421.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that you have collaborated with different organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1425.086s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1438.134s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just curious if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1439.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1469.445s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1475.207s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out, maybe when they do have their meetings of giving them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1486.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings, just to get the word out again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1518.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This week it's going to be tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1520.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Senior center at 6, Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1523.088s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1523.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1957.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1958.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1958.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1959.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to make sure that I'm understanding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1962.138s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the 265.4, that comes out of, that will come out of the capital plan money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1967.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That does not touch the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2107.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when would the deadline be after this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2110.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2114.626s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is us just basically saying that we are interested in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2118.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2119.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When is the deadline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2120.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2126.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and take the vote the proper way and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2133.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2136.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not, not that we're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2140.552s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying, I don't want to hear another fiasco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2191.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2192.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2193.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out how much time though we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2217.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2218.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because there's nothing to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2222.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2411.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: happen that day, but it could be a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.48s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2957.861s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, you're talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2964.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, the pool entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2972.399s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2973.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's, that's the door I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2974.72s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2975.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.405s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2997.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing I want to ask is, when you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3016.599s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just curious in knowing, when you wrote the report, did you have the wish list from the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3058.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I mean, over the years, it's basically been two just to make sure like, you know, the bathrooms are back up to date because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through the playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3070.293s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that's something that we've all looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3088.602s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3146.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3147.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3154.24s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They're the ones that we still have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1085.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1085.722s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1087.083s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1087.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen, to you and to your staff for being involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1092.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1098.632s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think there's a huge lesson here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1099.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is just, it's an incredible story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1103.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1104.037s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that we had two people in our own city that lived<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1114.873s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: very modestly, and have now given, you know, they were over what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1120.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The modest life yields, $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1123.375s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's a huge lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1125.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the lesson I hope that our students get from this, and for everyone actually that listens, is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1134.458s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to read the story, it was just a fabulous story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1136.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually shared it a little bit today with some people that I work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1140.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1157.214s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is something really tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1159.876s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1351.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1353.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1353.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1354.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1355.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you again, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1355.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen, for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1357.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, extremely proud of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1362.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1369.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1375.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1378.248s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1396.904s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Medford students are all going to this school or that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1402.77s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not saying that one school is better than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1405.252s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1410.657s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And when we approached it, we said, it's not fair to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1415.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1425.742s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think it's very important for the school, but also for the students, to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2165.742s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2174.346s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that you have collaborated with different organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2178.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2191.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just curious if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2192.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2222.387s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city, I know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out maybe, when they do have their meetings, of giving them the information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or you know, when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2252.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to get the word out again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2271.475s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This week it's going to be tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2273.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Senior center at 6, Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2275.317s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Today's Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2276.038s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2710.228s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2710.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2711.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, just point of clarification, I want to make sure that I'm understanding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2716.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So the 265-4, that will come out of the capital plan money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2720.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That does not- That's the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2860.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So when would the deadline be after this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2863.623s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through, this is us just basically saying that we are interested in this, this is what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2872.926s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When is the deadline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2873.866s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2879.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and take the vote the proper way, and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2886.348s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2888.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2889.149s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not that we're doing it, I'm just saying I don't want to hear another fiasco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2944.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Which is fine, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3841.531s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3899.693s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3906.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They've been better than the ones that we still have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=720.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=720.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cono.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=721.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=722.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, the total screenings that that came out was a total of 39, seven students came forward for you to know who they were, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=731.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=732.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Then the 32, what do we do with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=735.194s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=761.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=761.658s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=781.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=781.495s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very delicate line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=783.436s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know, but we're also trying to get the trust of the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=789.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if you have the seven that have come forward, what you want, what we're hoping to do is have that, the loyalty and the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=798.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: confidentiality so maybe those seven could hopefully give us maybe or have the other students say you know listen it's working no one is really saying anything about us we're going to counseling and we're helping you know if you want to go the door is open<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=846.873s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=877.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=878.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=879.212s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you for all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=880.232s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=883.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1683.039s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, to Sarah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1684.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks School for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1691.041s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1692.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1692.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You really should be proud of yourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1694.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's a wonderful thing to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1696.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1703.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1709.225s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1757.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1757.81s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1759.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That way, too, they have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1762.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody, so at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1774.714s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to try to find out what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1778.036s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2109.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2109.894s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2111.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2113.856s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Edwards, how many students have you had in the Pasco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2126.436s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So last year you had less than 49 students go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2133.843s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2136.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know over the years that we've tried to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2141.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know over the years it's been together and I kind of thought that was working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2145.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way the students felt that it was like one field trip for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2150.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, do we have any students that want to do like a one nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2173.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it wouldn't be right for the student either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2174.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just asking if anybody's asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2176.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2178.194s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2181.695s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What time do you get back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2188.676s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2188.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2193.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Bronx.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2194.877s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, they added a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2196.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You added the show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2197.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2197.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In place of the Bronx too, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2216.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2219.05s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We don't have your itinerary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2222.313s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you could provide that for us with the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2226.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And do you also have the same amount of chaperones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2234.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And 49 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2237.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2240.156s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2242.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so it's just the six chaperones and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2250.739s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2252.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3203.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3211.763s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3279.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3285.277s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't bring that with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3361.347s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3361.548s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3362.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I also have another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3363.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Tony, you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3375.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have to find out where we have our proms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3378.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have to find out at those locations if there's anything going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3381.867s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because we do have proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3387.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our banquets for our students, when we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3392.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: do we need to find out those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3434.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3443.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it would just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3663.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3663.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3664.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if like maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3684.132s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: is buying some just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3688.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it's five to 10, it might cost something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3691.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5278.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5278.992s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5280.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Keller, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5284.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5341.384s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because you have replaced lost or damaged books because the cost of replacing newer books is very high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5347.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So how about the new books that were bought at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5351.329s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Those are the ones I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5355.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So has the number of losing books increased?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6313.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6313.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6313.823s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only thing about having everybody here for the, uh, psych council meeting is I know that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6320.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of people like to sit at the round table like when we have an open meeting like that and they feel that they could come and be more casual in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6329.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we could still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6333.092s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, the PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6333.713s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6334.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because we were talking about side council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6340.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=749.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=750.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=750.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=752.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The total screenings that came out was a total of 39.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=757.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Seven students came forward for you to know who they were, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=760.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mm-hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=762.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=762.443s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Then the 32, what do we do with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=764.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=790.377s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, so what do we do to keep on reinforcing what we reinforce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=810.38s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=810.66s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very delicate line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=812.601s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=814.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=815.402s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we're also trying to get the trust of the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=817.603s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=818.303s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if you have the seven that have come forward, what we're hoping to do is have the loyalty and the confidentiality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=828.248s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So maybe those seven could hopefully give us, maybe, or have the other students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=833.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: say, you know, listen, it's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=836.097s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No one is really saying anything about us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=837.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to counseling and we're helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=840.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, if you want to go, the door is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=876.02s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=906.635s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=908.015s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=908.375s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you for all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=909.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together is a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1711.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, actually to Sarah, um, the question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks school for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1719.802s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1721.302s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1721.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's what you really should be proud of yourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1723.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's a wonderful thing to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1725.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1732.496s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years, do you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1786.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1786.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1788.732s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That way, too, they have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1791.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1798.015s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you and to try to find out what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1807.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2138.833s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2140.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2141.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, Mr. Edwards, how many students have you had in the past go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2162.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2165.656s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know over the years that we've tried to say, I know over the years it's been together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2173.061s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we kind of thought that was working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2175.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way the students felt that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2176.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was like one field trip for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2181.908s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have any students that want to do like a one-nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2202.49s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it wouldn't be right for the student either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2203.851s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just asking if anybody's asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2205.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2207.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2210.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What time do you get back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2217.854s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2217.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2226.955s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In place of the Bronx too, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2231.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, I was just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2248.202s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We don't have your itinerary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2251.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you could provide that for us with the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2255.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And do you also have the same amount of chaperones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2264.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And 49 students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2265.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2266.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2269.316s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2271.957s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, so it's just the six chaperones and the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2279.919s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2281.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2281.44s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3232.832s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3240.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3308.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3390.506s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3390.706s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3391.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I also have another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3392.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Tony, you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3404.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have to find out like where we have our proms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3407.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have to find out if those locations, if there's anything going on, because we do have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3412.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site are banquets for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3417.61s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season, do we need to find out if those places are off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3464.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3473.051s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it'd just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3693.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3693.745s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3703.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: like maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts, to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong is buying some, just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3717.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If it's five to 10, it might cost something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3720.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3756.245s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5307.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5308.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5310.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Keller, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5313.304s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5370.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because you have replaced lost or damaged books, because the cost of replacing newer books is very high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5376.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So how about the new books that were bought at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5380.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Those are the ones I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5384.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So has the number of losing books increased?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6338.654s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or added to our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6342.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6342.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6342.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The only thing about having everybody here for the psych council meeting is I know that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6349.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A lot of people like to sit at the round table like when we have an open meeting like that and they feel that they could come and be more casual in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6358.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, we could still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6362.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, the PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6362.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6363.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because we were talking about side council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6364.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1179.229s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: advisors, not to put any pressure on any of you, I'd like to know what type of questions do they ask you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1227.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1227.952s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so when you answer these questions, is it in an essay form?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1232.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How long do they give you to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1238.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You've won it, you might as well explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1274.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long does it take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1275.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do the rounds usually last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1279.59s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 45 minutes a round?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1281.212s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how many rounds do you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1285.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1286.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1288.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1289.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1292.401s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1297.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For person or overall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1314.535s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long is the trip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1339.434s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1340.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1340.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1341.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We cannot be any more prouder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1343.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, when you bring back the other award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1368.216s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say some food for thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1372.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1380.802s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1385.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1386.024s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1390.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1404.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1410.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1418.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2184.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2184.914s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2186.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, everything has been asked, so I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2189.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2913.154s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3732.975s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3734.777s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is very particular and a lot of details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3738.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the coffee with the Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3741.461s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3742.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How did you promote that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3743.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Was it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3748.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What time was it scheduled and is it individual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3806.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3807.608s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75 percent of at-risk seniors, which means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3816.662s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's 2.5 GPA or lower, so I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3825.829s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3863.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3865.681s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I see that you've had the second C3 day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3868.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3868.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how did that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3869.663s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3904.288s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that my colleague asked the Councilors at the high school have about 300 students apiece correct correct and We are still doing it that it's not we're doing it with alphabet in alphabetical order So that way not everyone has there's no there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors, correct Okay, and so with that being said how many seniors does each Councilor have do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3933.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 60 to 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3936.076s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4050.535s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4050.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4051.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4052.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A follow-up to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4053.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4061.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4097.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many electives do we have in all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4102.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how many are we going to limit to the freshmen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4105.023s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it 20?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4115.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4116.3s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4337.572s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4351.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So how do you work that into the CTE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4357.035s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4360.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4361.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we're also giving them the opportunity to go over to the technical side and maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4366.483s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: explore over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4367.784s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4405.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4412.039s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't think we were going to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4414.82s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this is now at least a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4417.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4420.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I won't do any more follow-ups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4421.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4425.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5184.224s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5185.024s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Benetton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5187.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5196.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that she knows what she's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5200.871s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at some, you know, another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5211.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5211.935s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but I know that part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5213.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the curiosity of that is, like, we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this learn it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5225.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5297.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5778.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5781.801s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that where it says here like this is for grade 5, but I'm assuming this is for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5789.13s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5791.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Also to send it home so a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5800.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5800.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5803.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5808.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5812.522s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5815.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6207.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we utilizing the the city calendar because this is a situation where I'm aware of it But on Thursday April 6 from 7 to 8 the method high school is having a science lecture and then on the same night<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6225.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're having a method high school, oh I'm sorry, it was a math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6229.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One says math, one says science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6230.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I thought it was two separate things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6231.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6233.477s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess that's all one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6234.818s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have two of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6236.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6243.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6246.524s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was just a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6248.465s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a program that I was approached on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6251.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are trying, the Italian consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6260.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: not only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6268.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so he wanted to showcase different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6271.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were fortunate enough, there was 14 schools that they showcased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6274.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first, which I believe was very beneficial for us because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6282.339s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6288.324s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6294.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just open to one side or another side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6296.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All students had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6298.864s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6316.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6320.389s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6326.573s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering, which made me really happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6340.423s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6349.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to Miss Nelson, Miss Caldwell, and of course, our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6353.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and, you know, walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6361.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was a good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6362.48s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a very good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1294.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: not to put any pressure on any of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1340.641s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and so when you answer these questions, like, is it, I mean, is it like in an essay form?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1345.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, how long do they give you to answer the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1351.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You've won it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1352.451s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You might as well explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1387.218s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long do the rounds usually last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1392.659s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 45 minutes a round?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1394.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how many rounds do you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1399.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1401.481s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1402.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1405.462s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1410.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For person or overall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1427.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how long is the trip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1452.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1453.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1454.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1454.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We cannot be any more prouder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1456.883s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, when you bring back the other award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1459.744s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And let us know how you make out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1466.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1467.128s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1467.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1477.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1482.449s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say some food for thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1485.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1493.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1498.596s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1499.096s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1504.038s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1517.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1524.035s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2297.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2297.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2299.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually, everything has been asked, so I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2302.471s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3028.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell us what the Welcome Project is for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3096.755s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3216.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3216.575s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So first, Mr. Benedetto second by Mr. Um, scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3220.477s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Uh, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3221.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3222.297s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3224.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3841.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.785s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3842.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3843.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3844.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3846.027s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Jensen for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3847.828s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It is very particular and a lot of details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3852.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm looking at the Coffee with the Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3855.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How did you promote that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3856.554s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Was it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3861.697s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What time was it scheduled and is it individual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3920.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3922.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75% of at-risk seniors, which means it's 2.5 GPA or lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3931.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3938.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3977.146s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3978.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I see that you've had the second C3 day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.389s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3981.869s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how did that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3982.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4017.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that my colleague asked, the councillors at the high school have about 300 students a piece, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4022.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4023.874s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we are still doing it that it's not, we're doing it in alphabetical order so that way not everyone has, there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4034.918s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and so with that being said, how many seniors does each councillor have, do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4046.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 60 to 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4049.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4163.762s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4165.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, please, a follow-up to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4166.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4174.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4210.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many electives do we have in all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4215.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how many are we going to limit to the freshmen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4218.065s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it 20?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4228.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4450.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4464.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So how do you work that into the CTE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4469.991s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.054s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4474.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we're also giving them the opportunity to go over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4477.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to the technical side and maybe explore over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4480.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4518.621s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4525.084s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't think we were going to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4527.865s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So this is now at least a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4530.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4533.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I won't do any more follow-ups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4534.187s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4538.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5297.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5297.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5298.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Benetton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5300.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5309.931s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that she knows what she's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5313.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5324.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5326.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the curiosity of that is we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5336.469s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: learn it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5338.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5894.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with the signature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5895.306s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make sure that where it says here, like this is for grade five, but I'm assuming this is for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5902.171s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5903.472s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, also to send it home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5905.613s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are, once you're approving it, we won't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.482s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5913.802s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5916.783s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5921.725s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5925.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5928.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6319.791s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6320.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6321.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6322.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One, are we utilizing the city calendar because this is a situation where, I don't know if you're aware of it, but on Thursday, April 6th, from 7 to 8, the Medford High School is having a science lecture, and then on the same night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6338.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're having a method high school's, oh I'm sorry, it was a math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6342.425s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One says math, one says science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6343.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I thought it was two separate things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6345.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6346.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess that's all one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6347.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We have two of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6349.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6356.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6359.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was just a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6361.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This was a program that I was approached on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6364.667s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The Italian Consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6373.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: not only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6381.858s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so he wanted to showcase different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6384.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were fortunate enough, there were 14 schools that they showcased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6387.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6391.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: which I believe was very beneficial for us because we really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6401.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6407.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just open to one side or another side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6409.976s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All students had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6411.893s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6429.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6433.418s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6439.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6452.274s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: which made me really happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6453.435s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it, to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6463.421s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nelson and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6464.021s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Caldwell, and of course, our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6466.182s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6474.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was a good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6475.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a very good day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=23.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=24.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because I know that when the BN director was here last week or two weeks ago, uh, she was saying that the rules have changed and it's very delicate because if it's the teacher who's giving out, let's say the medication, even though,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=39.578s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In this, it says that it's almost approved that a teacher could give out the medication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=107.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess the other concern for me would be is that I know that one of the options you had stated was that you could have a nurse contracted from where you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=116.497s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the thing is if you're talking about let's say we've had students that have gone across to Europe and they're taking different flights, it doesn't mean necessarily that the nurse will be with them from when they leave here until they get to where their destination is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=131.29s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's something I think that we also need to take in consideration and make sure that we do have coverage when we're thinking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=153.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So then could I just ask, I know that you are still in the middle of trying to get all the information for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=159.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we could find out from other districts how they're doing it, because I mean, they're sending their students away, not away, but they're going on their trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=180.962s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this is something that's changing now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=183.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We didn't have this implemented years ago or even up until last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=207.489s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess my last question is that if there is a child who does need special services, let's say the parent turns around and says that they want to be the chaperone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=219.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then we wouldn't have to worry about the nurse?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=221.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.208s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.368s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=617.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just for a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=618.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I agree with, you know, making sure that we have the protocol, but my concern is that as we're speaking tonight, it doesn't seem like anything is really concrete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=626.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I don't want to just rush into this and put something on our website or have parents know about it if we're not a hundred percent sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=633.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The motion was for the superintendent to draft a policy that we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.606s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.847s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was my clarification there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=638.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as far as I think for us to discuss tonight, how to figure this out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=643.172s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: is really, there's a lot going on because there are a lot of trips that go on and first of all, whoever is planning it at that moment in time does not have to go out and advertise that there's gonna be a child who's going to be a nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=657.616s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=658.896s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if there's a particular trip that this particular trip is now going to have three meals included, it's not dissected because this person here needs a little bit extra, this one here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=670.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's really up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=672.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to the group that's planning it, they don't have to go out and advertise and say, well, gee, we're going to be paying $2,000 more because we need a nurse for X child because it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=715.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, and I just want to finish it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=717.581s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=718.262s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's a little bit more involved than just us sitting here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=722.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I definitely agree with the superintendent doing that and making sure that we look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2276.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Can you speak up a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2279.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2280.471s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'll take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=9.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=22.759s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=27.027s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.827s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=161.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The reason that you haven't seen in the last few years is because actually Paulette and I had been paid for, our expenses were paid for MASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=170.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Paulette and I are no longer on MASC as far as executive board is concerned, so that's why the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=177.52s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you haven't seen it over the last few years, that's the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=481.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=482.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=483.123s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I want to congratulate you guys for doing, finally getting to this place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=488.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a big step for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=489.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a huge step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=491.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a huge step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=495.546s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We can still step bigger, but we're getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=498.846s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=501.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me how many other schools or districts are participating in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=505.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This across, because this is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.054s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.774s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How many chaperones are we looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=580.038s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are the chaperones paying the same amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=618.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and I know that it says that it has the insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=623.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is the insurance, I mean the details of the insurance, have they been over, like have you sat down or will you sit down with the parents and the students to make sure the details of the insurance itself because in the past we've had a couple of issues that parents thought it covered one thing and then it didn't cover another thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=652.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That will all be explained to our kickoff meeting which is March 15th with the travel agency that we're using That will be they'll have a whole sign off on that the parent and student also have to sign off on it with this part of their contract Okay to commit to the trip, and I'm looking at it, and I'm just going over It says here that this includes the cost of providing a nurse, and I'm just curious maybe through the mayor to the superintendent I don't remember seeing this in other trips and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=694.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What happens if we don't use that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=699.59s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=700.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And are the students paying for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=703.711s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it going to be out of their own pocket?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=704.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there fundraising involved with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=706.532s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=727.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Sounds good, and the only other question I have is, Mr. Seary might have the answer to this one, or Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=733.903s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Joy, which is, our last year at this time, we actually had the science department take the students to Disney at this time, and I'm not sure if that's happening again this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=775.741s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was thinking it was in April, but you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=777.803s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was in February last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=780.025s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All right, but it would have been nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=784.75s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been involved with that baggage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=786.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=788.253s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much, and congratulations to all, and we're looking forward to hearing back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.505s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.685s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1188.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess through you to the superintendent, I also need a little bit more of clarification as we've been speaking about the $1,700.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1195.834s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The $1,700 is money that the group, whoever's going, is going to raise to cover the $1,700?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.187s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.327s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess I have a couple of questions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1288.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's going to be incorporated into the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.02s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.461s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But now here's the other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1296.382s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Who pays for that person to go to Florida or Italy or wherever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1301.147s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So is that their trip is also incorporated into the students fees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1317.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so that's incorporated Yes, so that $1,700 isn't just is inclusive separate plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1322.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, that's the entire trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1339.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, but this is separate, so forget that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1341.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, forget it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.099s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1597.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, I have you both here, so I want to say congratulations for all the work that you, your staff, and everybody involved in this has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1604.485s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's been an incredible four years as a school committee member and as a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1609.028s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm really happy and thrilled to see the collaboration between the two and to see that divided<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1616.187s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the division between the two is finally diminishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1619.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As the superintendent said, I think this is a wonderful idea, but there were concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1625.611s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I had called him today because there's just so much to go over that we really can't do it in such a very short time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1633.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I am thrilled that we are, you know, we have decided, or I'm hoping that we decide to do this as a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1639.737s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way we could have more presented to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1642.501s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and that way we could sit down and actually go through the detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1645.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to put hysteria out there saying that one school is taking over the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1650.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to make sure that people understand that this has been a work in progress, that the people involved are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1656.865s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not something that the school committee or their superintendent has thrown at you or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1662.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also want to give the opportunity for people in our city to come and voice their opinion if they have concerns or whatever the situation may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1671.149s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I, again, congratulate all of you, including the students, because I've seen the atmosphere change and it's nice to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1685.097s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2118.838s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2119.879s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2120.079s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2121.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, I just want to go back and I totally agree with what my colleagues have said and both of you actually, all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2129.171s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's important that we do have this committee of the whole, but also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2134.457s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: let it be understood that this has been a, you know, work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2138.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This isn't something, and I have no intentions, and I'm sure we all have the same one, which is I'm not expecting to go into a committee of the whole for a couple of hours and have all the answers and shut the book and say, okay, guess what, this is what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2151.349s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I really would like to see is I would like to see as we post the meeting to make sure that we invite alumni,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2157.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that we make sure that we, you know, invite not only our alumni as students, but our alumni who are now our businesses, because I know that there's a lot of collaboration between the high school, the vocational school, and our businesses right now, but really the input of everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2173.082s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we have to understand, as I've mentioned before, and the fact is that having the opportunity of being on MASC, I've also seen the opportunity of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2183.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: how vocational schools have been changing throughout not only the state of Massachusetts, but throughout the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2189.091s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we have always had a strong vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2192.212s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And no one is saying that what we've done in the past wasn't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2197.735s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're just saying, let's go forward because we all have to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2201.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And change, as my colleagues have said, is a very delicate situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2205.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I've had these conversations with alumni and strong people that have been affiliated with the vocational school in the past and said, what do you want to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2217.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're getting rid of a vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2219.456s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is not getting rid of one or eliminating the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2223.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is a collaboration, a collaboration that we've been working on for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2227.401s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a school committee, we've been working on it even longer than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2231.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, again, the word out there, you know, the rumors are going to start, the gossiping is going to start, but I want to make sure that people understand the integrity of what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2240.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the integrity of what we're doing is to give the opportunity for our students to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2246.388s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whether they're in the high school side or the vocational side, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2250.25s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We want to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2251.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that these kids leave our school with the ability of doing both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2255.633s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And also making sure that our students are proud when they leave, no matter which side they're leaving from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2261.837s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is not a failure of the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2263.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Many, many years ago, it was like, oh, you go to here if you can't be book smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2268.022s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That doesn't exist anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2269.763s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Book smart is across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2271.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2272.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I tell students, you know, I tell<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2276.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: people that have known what our vocational school was many years ago, that, well, why aren't our kids doing this anymore when they come out of the vocational?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2283.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I said, they don't have the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2285.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because before, you had the choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2288.273s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You could do the academic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2290.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2291.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it wasn't as strong or mandated by the state as we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2295.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so our students don't have that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2297.658s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to, that's a really big thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2300.579s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for me, because we all hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2302.68s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want those rumors to squash the good work that's being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2307.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a work in progress, and it's going to take more than just one Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2539.6s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2731.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Motion to accept the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2735.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to say, yeah, I mean, this is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2738.086s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is really amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2886.094s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say, if possible, to both of you, if possible, like when the students are doing, I mean, I know you can't do it all the time, but is it possible to have certain things like videotaped that we could actually put it into a video and show it off and maybe even bring it to one of our meetings and see what's really going on on an everyday basis without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2911.395s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know the school is open for all of us to visit, and I know that we're all welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2916.119s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even though we enjoy doing that, I think sometimes the students might think, oh, there's other people watching us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2920.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Whereas if they're free and they don't have that type of, yes, they have to have the supervision, but not our eyes being there, that maybe it would be nice to see and have them even come in down the road after this is done and give their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3032.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3033.454s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Great segue, by the way, to the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3035.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4074.854s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4075.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4077.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: For members that, I know this is a, it's kind of thrown at us, and I know being a little bit newer on this process, it's harder to understand, but just to explain, I know that with the math that you just talked about, when this all came about, we were basically in the same position that we were in for the math as we are now for the science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4096.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And what happened is the department heads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4100.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and the teachers collaborated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4102.553s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They sought out the information that they were looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4105.618s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Even though the curriculum didn't change until the following year, it was presented to us around budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4110.922s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it was presented to us prior to budget time, so that way we could actually allocate how much money we're gonna put towards the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4118.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then it does take a component of everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4122.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4123.267s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Caldwell said, it wasn't that we chose as a school committee which classes were gonna do certain things, that we also gave the opportunity to the teachers that work on the subject on an everyday basis, that they decided what they wanted in their classroom room, and at one point in time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4138.913s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: they thought each group was different from the group next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4142.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So as far as I am understanding it all, it's a very similar process, even though it might not be the academic year of 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4151.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with us knowing what has been brought to us by the state and with the work that the department heads and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4157.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Caldwell are doing, they're going out, they're seeking out the best possible programs for us, then they will be bringing it back to us and in the meantime also reviewing it with the people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4170.466s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So there's a lot of components to it rather than just saying this is what we're approving and that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=407.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=408.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The trip was very successful a couple of years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=410.988s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We heard a lot from the students that participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=413.731s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was really nice to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=416.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I believe just a point of interest is that when we spoke about the trips, especially outside of the country, or even within the country, I believe we had, as a school committee, had said that one of the mandatory things was to have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=431.025s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=432.906s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the question is at what point, to what point do the kids get a refund if anything does happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=439.73s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will the insurance kick into that or do you work with the insurance company to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=472.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A full refund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=487.103s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: of safety reasons basically, that was the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=489.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is that something that would be covered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=530.492s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=556.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What about if we have a senior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=606.054s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=606.854s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=607.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=610.317s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do we have a price?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=614.821s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did I not see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=628.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1044.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1044.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1045.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to go back to the safety part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1050.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You said that there's a chaperone that comes from the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1053.143s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will they, he, she,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1055.828s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: stay at the hotel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1083.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1083.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And on the peace of mind, um, add the portion of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1089.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there an extra coverage by any chance monetary coverage on that as far as like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1094.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague was saying, if God forbid, someone has to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1098.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you know if there's extra coverage on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1137.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group that went out for an educational piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1144.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was more a group of students after they graduated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1148.53s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that did go down to have a nice time before college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1153.034s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1161.782s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1166.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're always making sure that there's extra coverage and make sure that there is the insurance that's part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1172.683s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But knowing that there's actually a chaperone that's part of the local part of it, that's a huge part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1177.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because unfortunately with that particular group, there was no one from the agency that they had used or the group that they had used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1185.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that was actually down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1187.519s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's a great piece to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1219.177s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1518.765s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1518.925s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1520.107s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually had the pleasure of participating in that day a few years back and it was just a wonderful, wonderful day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1529.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I can't wait for you to come back and tell us all about it because it's probably something that you're not expecting because it wasn't what I was expecting of that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1536.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to see the amount of students that are there and to see the students that represent not only us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1541.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but really cities and towns across the state of Massachusetts and to work together for such a wonderful cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1547.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm very proud of you and for the other student, Josephine, but really looking forward for you to come back and share what you did that day with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1557.03s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1560.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2382.593s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2382.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2384.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2384.654s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I don't really have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2386.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just, I guess on the record as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2394.621s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I just wanted to be on record that again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2400.044s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They just kind of always put the cart before the horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2403.547s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2408.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2409.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: you know, it's important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have, they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because you can't, it's not fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2420.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fear to our students that are graduating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2422.625s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about park because they came and they spoke about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2429.21s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, they had no answers to the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2432.993s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I was on the board of DSC,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2436.961s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: on working with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2441.425s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2552.674s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2561.561s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All our students are going to take this exam online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2564.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's going to be great for our administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2566.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to, you know, get the test scores back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2569.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2575.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for technology is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2577.64s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's huge across this whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2579.583s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And not only the state, but it's going to be across the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2582.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2586.371s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because the way I feel about it, I said it a few years back, is that I basically feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2591.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that if we don't have the proper technology and honestly I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best but when you do go to a conference like that or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board it's something that they really need to start thinking about because technology I mean look at your own homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2616.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or where you work, if you're working outside of the school system, it's constantly, constantly changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2622.526s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2625.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2632.112s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, that's almost like the technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2634.694s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I will be, I will say it again, that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2641.18s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2649.767s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And, um, I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe that, um, the governor had given us was like a hundred<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2660.91s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: million dollars or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2662.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it sounds like a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2664.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state I mean it ended up being what like ten thousand dollars or something if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2670.598s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So again this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3280.284s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3280.464s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3281.825s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, definitely agree with my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3284.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for all the reports and everything that you brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3287.13s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as, uh, if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3300.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3301.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, and again, I can't reiterate it enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3303.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think they sound like an old record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3306.09s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think Paulette and I both sound like old records, been saying it for 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3310.691s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3314.192s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3322.033s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, you can get the information, but sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3329.795s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other, and you do bond, and you do, you know, over the years, become friends, and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way are you going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3350.244s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I will get off my soapbox, but, again, look at the date for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3354.326s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a surprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3355.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It comes every year, just like Thanksgiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3357.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, you know, we all take our vacation time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3360.809s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3367.592s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3448.44s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3449.541s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3450.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on, they finally got on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3454.904s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that the high school you've been on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3459.627s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So parents are definitely on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4315.748s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4316.308s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4316.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno, I just threw you to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4320.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4326.971s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4336.114s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One-on-one type of situation the opportunities to change right and then last year he was talking about this year of this academic school year that they had started another program Nexus and that was the one I I forgot the name of it So I apologize, but I would like an upgrade an update on that if possible to say we've been on We've been in school for a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4355.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd like to know like numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4357.966s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4362.852s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4367.333s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4367.534s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5791.024s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to just piggyback on the letter that the superintendent put out to everyone and also to The letter he just presented us for Washington George, Washington I was listening to something today and it really dawned on there's been a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5809.131s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I Don't want to get into politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5810.491s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5810.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm actually asking people to put politics aside on Thursday and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5818.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: have your family together, enjoy family, enjoy that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5822.64s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've heard so many crazy things from me that people are trying to avoid other people, are not inviting other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5830.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5832.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Political life aside and everything else, really take part of Thanksgiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5838.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm asking everyone just to have a safe, happy Thanksgiving and just really put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5843.61s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the political agenda aside because nothing changes the way you are, nothing changes our ethics as people, nothing changes the morals that we have, the way we raise our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5857.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was my thing for wishing everyone and really thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=531.535s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=533.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The trip was very successful a couple of years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=535.418s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We heard a lot from the students that participated and it was really nice to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=540.601s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I believe just a point of interest is that when we spoke about the trips, especially outside of the country or even within the country, I believe we had, as a school committee, had said that one of the mandatory things was to have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=555.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=557.174s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the question is that to what point do the kids get a refund if anything does happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=563.982s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will the insurance kick into that or do you work with the insurance company to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=597.072s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A full refund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=606.589s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and what about if there is a situation, like unfortunately there was a situation because of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=611.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think that was the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=654.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=680.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What about if we have a senior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=730.311s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=731.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=732.151s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I was just looking... Do we have a price?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=739.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Did I not see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=752.313s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry, Paige.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1170.089s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to go back to the safety part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1174.212s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You said that there's a chaperone that comes from the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1177.374s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Will they, he, she,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1180.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: stay at the hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1207.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and on the peace of mind,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1210.701s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, add the portion of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1213.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is there an extra coverage by any chance monetary coverage on that as far as like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1218.598s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As my colleague was saying, if God forbid someone has to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1221.46s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Do you know if there's like extra coverage on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1261.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1267.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: it was more a group of students after they graduated high school that did go down to have a nice time before college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1277.255s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1286.017s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1290.576s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Vi är alltid säker på att det finns extra uppfyllelse och att det finns insuranser som är en del av det, men att vi vet att det finns en chaperone som är en del av det lokala, det är en stor del.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1305.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Det var från den agensy som de använde, eller gruppen som de använde, som faktiskt var där nere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1311.744s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Så jag tror att det är en bra del av det här.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1643.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1643.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1644.327s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I actually had the pleasure of participating in that day a few years back, and it was just a wonderful, wonderful day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1653.555s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I can't wait for you to come back and tell us all about it, because it's probably something that you're not expecting, because it wasn't what I was expecting of that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1660.761s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to see the amount of students that are there, and to see the students that represent not only us, but really cities and towns across the state of Massachusetts, and to work together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1670.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for such a wonderful cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1672.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very proud of you and for the other student, Josephine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1677.088s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But really looking forward for you to come back and share what you did that day with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1681.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1684.551s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2506.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Muy bien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2507.209s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2507.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2508.389s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2508.869s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't really have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2510.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just, I guess on the record, as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2519.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to be on record that, again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2524.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They just kind of always put the cart before the horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2527.757s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2533.539s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2545.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not fair to our students that are graduating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2546.845s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about PARCC because they came and they spoke about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2553.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, they had no answers to the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2558.269s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was on the board of DESC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2561.458s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: working with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers so my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2676.904s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2685.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: All our students are going to take this exam online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2688.774s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's going to be great for our administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2690.615s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're going to get the test scores back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2693.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2699.293s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for technology is huge and it's huge across this whole state and not only the state but it's going to be across the nation and so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this because the way I feel about it I said it a few years back is that I basically feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2716.002s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: that if we don't have the proper technology, and honestly, I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this, is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best, but when you do go to a conference like that, or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear, and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board, it's something that they really need to start thinking about, because technology, I mean, look at your own homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2741.095s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: or where you work if you're working outside of the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2744.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's constantly, constantly changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2746.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2750.199s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2756.342s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, that's almost like the technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2758.923s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, I will be, I will say it again that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2765.406s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2773.97s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe, that the governor had given us was like a hundred,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2785.127s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: million dollars or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2786.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it sounds like a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2789.01s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state, I mean, it ended up being what, like $10,000 or something, if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2794.814s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So again, this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3404.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3406.812s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Definitely agree with my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3408.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for all the reports and everything that you brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3411.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3424.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3425.849s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, and again, I can't reiterate it enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3428.23s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think I sound like an old record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3430.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think Paulette and I both sound like old records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3432.752s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Been saying it for 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3434.892s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3438.393s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3446.216s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, you can get the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3448.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3453.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other and you do bond and you do, you know, over the years become friends and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way you're going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3474.427s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I will get off my soapbox, but again, look at the date for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3478.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not a surprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3479.669s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It comes every year, just like Thanksgiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3481.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, you know, we all take our vacation time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3484.99s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Unfortunately, I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3491.774s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again, it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3572.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3573.725s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3574.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3577.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They finally got on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3579.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I know that the high school- Is that all the parents you've been on, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3582.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3582.849s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3583.83s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So parents are definitely on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4439.934s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4441.195s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just threw you to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4444.597s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4451.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4460.125s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a one-on-one type of situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4463.126s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4463.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then last year he was talking about this year, this academic school year, that they had started another program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4470.029s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nexus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4470.749s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that was the one, I forgot the name of it, so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4473.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I would like an update on that, if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4478.293s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We've been in school for a few months, I'd like to know numbers, how's it going, what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4487.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: – Okay, after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4490.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: – Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4491.697s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5913.645s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Any others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5914.305s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5914.445s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Puno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5915.165s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to just piggyback on the letter that the superintendent put out to everyone and also to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5925.512s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was listening to something today and it really dawned on, there's been a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5933.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to get into politics actually, I'm actually asking people to put politics aside on Thursday and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5942.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: have your family together, enjoy family, enjoy that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5946.772s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've heard so many crazy things from me that people are trying to avoid other people, are not inviting other people, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5956.58s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Political life aside and everything else really take part of Thanksgiving and I'm asking everyone just to have a safe, happy Thanksgiving and just really put the political agenda aside because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5970.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nothing changes the way you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5972.9s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nothing changes our ethics as people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5975.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Nothing changes the morals that we have, the way we raise our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5981.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was my thing for wishing everyone and really thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=716.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=719.736s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=719.916s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=720.657s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, I know that we, you just mentioned too, that we have the letter that we were going to send out and I just want to make sure that when we send out the letter that we also amendment with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=731.079s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: with the consideration that even though the Rangers are coming out to test and to evaluate what's going on, that it would make sense that they would do it during the school time while there are children crossing and adults crossing and that there's full-fledged type of traffic going on, not on a holiday and not on a professional day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=751.983s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2200.598s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.318s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.498s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno, on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2202.839s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2204.219s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to everyone who does participate in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2207.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that there's a lot of work behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2209.381s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And each and every year, it just seems like it gets more successful each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2214.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it does take a lot of work for everyone to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2218.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess one of the things that I never asked, but I guess I'm curious and knowing is, if there's a way next year when we put it on, is as kids are walking in, maybe have a list of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2230.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: what school they go to, what year they're in, because I know that it is open to all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2235.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not just Medford High School students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2238.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm curious in knowing what other schools do attend our college night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2243.062s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a curiosity, because I know a lot of the parochial schools, and I know children that are going to charter schools also come to that college fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2252.4s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2253.1s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2255.101s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even our own students just to know what, I don't need names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2257.702s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to know what year they're in and what schools they go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2903.769s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2903.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2904.85s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to say congratulations to the students that, not only the students, but the video that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2910.413s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot was just talking about, the Just Say No video, is really well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2917.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was done professionally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2918.457s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was done with heart and soul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2920.478s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was able to see it, and I was able to actually share it with a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2925.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if you haven't seen it, to really take that moment to look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2930.178s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It'll not only impress you by what the message is all about, but also impress you of who our kids are and the high school students that we are developing and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2941.865s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the community part of that, too, because it's not just students, but it's everyone from administration to teachers to our custodians to police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2951.529s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really a community video and I was very, very impressed by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2956.711s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Second of all, I do want to say, since you did bring up the voting for tomorrow, I want to say thank you to my colleague, Paulette Van der Kloot, who's really been going around advocating for just for question two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2970.753s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And hopefully people will vote no on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2975.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I have to say that I would be really remiss if I don't say it because it's just really frustrated me a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2982.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that is listening to our governor's commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2988.343s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As a parent, as a school committee member, I have to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2998.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just feel that if someone in that position comes out and says, you know, this is a different choice if your district is failing, I just have to say, whether it's political or not, shame on the person who's saying that, because under that person's watch, not one district should be failing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3015.369s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We're crossing the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=3130.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Diolch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=753.124s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mrs. Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=754.792s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now this was refreshing, I have to say, and this is why we sit here sometimes, and I'll speak for myself, and this was very well, very well worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=765.49s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=766.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to everyone, but I also want to congratulate Mr. Plattie for really bringing the ideas to our children, letting them come to school happy, letting them come to school because they want to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=783.428s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know, I get emotional for all this stuff, but it really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=787.232s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, people think maybe this isn't important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=789.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important, because these children have learned so much about our governmental process that they don't even know they've learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=797.157s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1656.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1656.764s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1657.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a point of information, as far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also, is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1676.781s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city, we do not hold the hat of a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1687.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1695.135s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's really something that I want people to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1698.678s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1703.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1722.48s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2665.415s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, no, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2668.417s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2670.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Melanie, for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2671.758s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, just a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2673.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You just, you were speaking about a survey that was given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2677.161s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you reiterate who gave out the survey and where it was given?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2689.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2694.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing you're also speaking about the piloting underwriting, understanding our difference, our differences program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2702.721s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2703.001s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2755.152s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, was this, I'm just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us that we had any part of saying of what schools were gonna be piloted or what schools weren't gonna be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2798.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, but excuse me, but this, this seems like it's already happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2838.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2839.256s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm not saying no, I understand that the teachers have a lot, I guess what my question is, who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2861.385s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because I mean, the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3570.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3572.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3572.746s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3573.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3574.607s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3575.567s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3613.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3614.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing is that the calls and emails that I got were actually who determined who's identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3624.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And parents are like, well, my child is in that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3627.953s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How do I know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3629.093s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How do they know that that child wasn't near the other child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3632.558s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3638.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And different stories go out there for different parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3641.521s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least if we could at least advise parents how at least we came to identifying the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3721.585s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3721.905s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I appreciate that because like I said, I think it was just parents just, you know, hearing different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3726.929s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that everyone's done their due diligence and doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3734.075s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3735.944s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: different stories go out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3737.185s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so parents were saying, well, wait a minute, how do I know who's identified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3740.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And without overstepping the confidentiality situation, it was just more like, okay, tell me the stages of how it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3748.715s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So for parents that are listening, I hope they heard this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3752.358s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm hoping that we are gonna have that meeting, that parents, if they still have questions or concerns, come to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4791.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4791.705s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4792.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: While we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to to snow, remove their snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4804.271s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we've had students that have done it for like community service and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4808.513s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4817.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Councilors at school maybe come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4819.579s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that it's difficult sometimes we don't have a lot a lot of students but if we could get something working like that that would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5172.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5174.811s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Then should we admit, should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy, meaning the needs of all communities to make it very clear where we stand with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5203.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5210.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way, whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Skerry will actually have to stand up and, and express what our needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5218.713s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5236.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.031s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.171s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5237.952s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5250.323s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way our delegate could express that when he goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5254.626s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5256.198s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5262.961s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5280.17s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5346.022s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6359.637s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6359.857s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunoz first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6361.798s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to go back on school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6366.02s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A little bit frustrating because I totally understand it's a huge undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6370.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But like we're doing train-the-trainer assistance now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6375.04s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why don't we do train-the-trainer like in the summertime so that way we could try to get the system up and going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6381.045s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess that's one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6383.367s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other question is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6386.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we have, it's common nature how it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6390.129s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we had the I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6391.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we had I-PASS, everybody hated I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6394.55s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have school brains and everybody loves I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6397.471s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6399.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the fact remains is that now we have people that have been used to at least getting on, checking their children's grades or, you know, getting progress reports via the I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6414.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now it's kind of like they're closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6416.398s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's completely closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6417.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess my concern is, as far as parents, what are we asking them to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6423.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we asking them to go back to sending emails to their teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6427.606s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not elementary school that I'm talking about as much as middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6431.788s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents aren't in the yard that they see their teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6436.231s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Everybody has different hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6438.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't want to get to the point where we're bombarding our teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6441.855s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what are we going to be telling our parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6444.898s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like, we're not going to get, the high school is not going to be rolling it out until after the first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6449.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents have, you know, questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6451.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They want to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6453.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are we telling them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6549.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6549.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I, I mean, I totally understand that, but I, again, I agree with all of my colleagues that at least put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6556.15s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way, you know, we don't have different schools saying different messages or sending different messages because I think that was the frustrating part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6563.832s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People want to appease everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6565.952s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But as you said, you don't want to throw out a date and then parents are expecting that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6570.494s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now we come across as not abiding by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6575.175s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6944.789s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6946.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6953.713s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6959.436s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6963.998s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are doing their taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6969.545s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And tickets are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6976.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They receive scholarships from the Kiwanis, and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6991.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: In the foyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1072.582s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mrs. Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1074.235s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now, this was refreshing, I have to say, and this is why you sit here sometimes, well, why we sit here sometimes, and I'll speak for myself, and this was very well, very well worth why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1087.045s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just want to say thank you to everyone, but I also want to congratulate Mr. Plattie for really bringing the ideas to our children, letting them come to school happy, letting them come to school because they want to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1102.875s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know, I get emotional for all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1105.016s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But it really, you know, people think maybe this isn't important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1108.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's very important because these children have learned so much about our governmental process that they don't even know they've learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1116.601s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1976.015s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1976.215s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1977.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1978.276s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: As far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1996.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2002.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We do not hold the hat of a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2007.086s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2014.567s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's really something that I want people to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2018.108s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2023.296s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: for the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2987.226s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2987.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2987.986s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2988.186s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2988.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2989.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Melanie, for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2990.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2991.727s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2992.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You were speaking about a survey that was given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2996.569s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you reiterate who gave out the survey and where it was given?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3009.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3012.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3013.927s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing, you were also speaking about the piloting, understanding our differences program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3022.13s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3022.41s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3075.807s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us, that we had any part of saying of what schools were going to be piloted or what schools weren't going to be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3118.197s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But, excuse me, but this seems like it's already happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3158.932s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3159.813s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I understand that the teachers have a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3161.354s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess my question is who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3180.776s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, because I mean the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3889.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3891.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mrs. Coño.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3893.113s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3894.014s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3894.974s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One is, I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3933.779s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing is that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3937.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The calls and emails that I got were actually, who determined who's identified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3943.723s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And parents are like, well, my child is in that school, how do I know that, how do they know that that child wasn't near the other child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3951.945s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls, and different stories go out there for different parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3960.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So at least if we could at least advise parents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3964.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How at least we came to identifying the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4041.005s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4041.325s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I appreciate that, because like I said, I think it was just parents just hearing different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4046.348s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that everyone's done their due diligence in doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4054.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Pero, nuevamente, las historias diferentes salen por ahí, así que los padres estaban diciendo, bueno, espera un momento, ¿cómo puedo saber quién se ha identificado?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4060.365s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Y sin exagerar la situación de confidencialidad, fue más como, ok, cuéntame las etapas de cómo fue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4065.049s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Así que para los padres que están escuchando, espero que hayan escuchado esto, y espero que tengamos esa reunión, que los padres, si todavía tienen preguntas o preocupaciones, vengan a ello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5110.884s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno, while we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to remove their snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5123.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And we've had students that have done it for community service and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5127.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5136.954s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know it's difficult, sometimes we don't have a lot of students, but if we could get something working like that, that would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5491.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5495.671s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Then should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy meaning the needs of all communities, to make it very clear where we stand with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5513.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5522.941s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5525.022s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So amending this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5529.264s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, so that way whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Skerry will actually have to stand up and express what our needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5538.048s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5556.397s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, and I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5557.277s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean, that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5569.666s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way our delegate could express that when he goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5573.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5575.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5582.303s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh, meaning that it meet meets all communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5599.509s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6677.917s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6679.198s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno is first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6681.18s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to go back on school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6685.362s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: A little bit frustrating because I totally understand it's a huge undertaking, but like we're doing train the trainer assistance now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6694.372s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Why don't we do train the trainer like in the summertime so that way we could try to get the system up and going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6700.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess that's one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6702.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The other question is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6705.437s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we have, it's common nature how it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6709.459s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, we had the I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6711.219s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When we had I-PASS, everybody hated I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6713.88s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Now we have school brains and everybody loves I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6716.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So it's just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6718.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But the fact remains is that now we have people that have been used to at least getting on, checking their children's grades or, you know, getting progress reports via the I-PASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6733.742s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ahora es como si estuvieran cerradas, completamente cerradas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6736.804s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Así que creo que mi preocupación es, en cuanto a los padres, ¿qué les estamos pidiendo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6742.248s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: ¿Les estamos pidiendo que vuelvan a enviar e-mails a sus maestros?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6745.43s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: O, no es la escuela de la secundaria que estoy hablando de tanto como la escuela de la secundaria y la escuela de la universidad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6750.654s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Los padres están en el jardín y ven a sus maestros.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6753.356s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Todos tienen horas diferentes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6754.336s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No quiero llegar al punto en el que estamos bombardeando a nuestros maestros<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6761.181s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But what are we going to be telling our parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6764.223s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like, we're not going to get, the high school's not going to be rolling it out until after the first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6768.566s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Parents have, you know, questions, they want to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6772.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What are we telling them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6869.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I totally understand that, but again, I agree with all of my colleagues that at least put it out there so that way we don't have different schools saying different messages or sending different messages because I think that was the frustrating part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6883.183s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People want to appease everyone, but as you said, you don't want to throw out a date and then parents are expecting that date and now we come across as not abiding by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6894.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6894.714s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7263.955s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Shout out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7264.496s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7265.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7273.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7278.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7283.332s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They are doing their Taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7289.236s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Tickets are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7295.92s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They receive scholarships from the Kiwanis and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7305.804s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yep, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2351.239s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Through you to the superintendent, I just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2358.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's an important and very important piece of this conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2361.963s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be seen, to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2369.193s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, I'm not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2379.357s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2383.859s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I will, uh, inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1220.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1220.887s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Coño.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=900.279s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=901.479s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=902.28s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=902.7s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Rodriguez, to inform us of this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=906.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess one of the questions I have is that I appreciate everybody doing this diligently the minute you found out about it, but I guess what goes back to me is the fact of if we have children, whether or not they were in the vicinity or not, rumors start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=922.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One story, you know, is a domino effect and becomes a larger story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=927.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess for me is why weren't parents informed of not necessarily giving out the information because of confidentiality and things like that, but if the students were talking about this incident that occurred and then they went home and they were telling their parents, why wasn't something like at least sent out saying, you know, we understand what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=949.884s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: This is what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=951.045s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not this story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=952.166s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not that story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=953.802s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It didn't get into a larger scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=957.744s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think maybe parents would have been a little bit more confident in the fact that they say, okay, the administration knows about it, the kids are talking about it, but let's see what the story is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=968.45s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess that's my biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=971.331s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know in the past when things have happened, and even though everybody's been really diligent about putting a plan together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=978.22s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's at that moment that at least we hope that something goes out from the school saying we're very much aware what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=985.043s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe even in that letter saying if there's a child who's having a hard time really understanding what's happening, send them and we'll speak to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=995.189s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Have one of the Councilors speak to them on a one-to-one or something like that just to know that there's the help out there while everything is being placed in a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1005.254s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess that's really my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1008.71s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Anybody who knows us is always talking about the most important thing, whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, is to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1015.808s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And that has to come from the top all the way to the bottom, including parents and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1020.07s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And students, especially if they're afraid and they hear something, even though they weren't there, are going to go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1027.173s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the story is going to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1030.074s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying that the child, by any means, is lying or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1033.315s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But they're in their panic mode, and their emotions are high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1037.517s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess that is my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1039.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the other concern is that, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1042.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I appreciate Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1043.848s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Rodriguez coming and giving us the breakdown, but as a school committee member, I would like to have Mr. Johnson come and speak to us and let us know what's going on in the school with the numbers, what he, you know, what he has planned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1058.56s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, this has nothing in reflection to Mr. Johnson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1061.882s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just that he is the principal and we need to get the information from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2234.109s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2235.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2235.49s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2236.275s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, I'd like to basically reiterate what my colleague Paula just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2241.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I don't think, with all due respect, it's not the fact that we're trying to hype it or make it into a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2247.664s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's just the fact, again, of something happening a week ago, or I don't know at this point if it was a week ago or two weeks ago, and putting myself in those shoes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2258.853s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think that's something that we all have to think of, too, is that as we speak, we're always saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2265.238s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: special needs, and they have their confidentiality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2269.321s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And even though we do have confidentiality for all students that come to our district, I think parents need to understand that when we're talking about confidentiality, we're talking about all students and not just the students that are in a particular group, because I think that is, again, extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2288.414s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, it's just basically the fact of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2292.997s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I get everything that's happened, but I think it was just the fear of listening to your child come home, we're different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2299.783s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, it happens to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2301.145s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It happens to whether you're young or even adults.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2304.488s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: One person says one thing and then another one adds on and another one adds on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2307.911s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as a parent, you're home, you really don't know what's going on in the school itself because you weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2313.376s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And now you have all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2315.338s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So again, I mean, something should have come out from the school saying what had happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2322.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I guess my other thing, too, is that this is a very isolated situation with two students that happen to be in the same classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2331.771s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Since it's already happened, is it possible or is it something to think about maybe trying to separate these two students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2338.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2340.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2341.734s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2342.355s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all I need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2430.642s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, well, tonight, really quick on that, Mr. Johnson is going to appear before us in the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2437.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I would also like for him to have heads up on all the situations that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2442.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Rodriguez brought here, only because I don't want him to come here next week or two weeks, whatever, and say, gee, I'm not aware of it, I'll come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2450.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to make it very fruitful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2452.44s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3306.33s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: basically echoing what has been previously said, but I was looking at the report and I just want to make sure that, I mean, first of all, I want to say, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3317.775s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I love the idea that we were able to get this funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3320.516s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Um, and I know that we are looking at the Roberts, I'm sorry, at the Brooks right now, because especially the situation that occurred,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3327.16s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: but my biggest fear is always I don't wanna wait till a situation that occurs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3330.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I also wanna make sure that we're looking at the high school on Winthrop Street because even though we've been trying to put some signs and things up, again, there's a lot of trees that are, they're really low and you really can't see what you're putting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3345.726s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that we're also looking at Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3352.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and we wanna make sure that we have the proper signage out there, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4282.574s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4284.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I guess the thing is that when you said that parents are going to be asked if their children want to opt out or not, and then you also mentioned that if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4292.826s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the student decides to do this, they will be informed that depending on the level, some of the information will not be confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4301.429s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4301.909s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I guess in between that, is there something, is there a form that they're going to sign saying that you definitely informed them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4315.907s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because my concern is that if we say it verbally, if something comes out that the child doesn't want really to be exposed, they could turn around and say that they were never told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4326.994s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my other concern is also if the child is 18 years old and older or if the child is 18 and younger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4335.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, it's all students have the ability to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4339.352s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, but I'm talking about if there was a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4341.894s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, a form, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4342.915s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If there's some type of form that they have to sign, releasing the fact that they know the outcome, if it's going to be higher, it's not going to be confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4351.303s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If the student is 17 years old and they sign the form, then the parents need to sign that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4368.613s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's just that little piece of confidentiality because they could at that moment say, sure, I'll give you, you know, you ask me and I'll do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4376.118s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then just in case they don't like the, I don't want to say reaction or the restriction from it, I don't want us to be liable saying it's a he said, she said situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4389.686s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6138.213s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6139.796s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mrs. Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6140.718s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6143.219s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know with any software program that especially when it rolls out, there's always going to be glitches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6147.06s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm happy to hear that you have a lot of this in the planning session of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6153.542s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What I have heard is, though, I know that what teachers put into the system and what secretaries are putting into the system and what certain administrators are putting into the system is all different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6164.824s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So even though they have building trainers that they could go to sometimes, especially when it gets really busy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6172.447s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We really can't pull certain teachers out that have, let's say, learned the program to go and help someone at that moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6179.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that I've heard a lot of Mr. DeLaver and actually Mr. Tootin have been helping out tremendously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6188.306s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But one question that did come up, speaking to a few people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6192.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible, maybe, if there's some type of hotline or something that, I know myself, we're actually, where I am, we're rolling out a totally different program, so we're piloting it, but I guess the question is, is there a hotline that you could actually be doing something, and at that moment, if you have that question, you could actually call someone and say, could you help me through this, because sometimes it's difficult, though, to go and grab someone in the building, and you're at a standstill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6221.222s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: because you can't get to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6289.638s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And there's this other program that you're saying that you could actually go into the School Brains system and actually look up the question that you might be having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6415.059s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, we'll look forward to hearing about it, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6417.26s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information, I did forget about Jean Irwin, so I don't want you thinking that I didn't hear good things about her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6422.003s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I did know that there were the three of them, I just forgot about her, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6424.684s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8978.122s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8991.353s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's an important and very important piece of this conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8994.996s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be seen and to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9003.055s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9012.379s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=9016.881s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I will inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2628.237s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ac fel rhaglen, rydych chi'n ymwneud â'ch ysgol, rydych chi ddim yn gwybod beth sy'n digwydd ynglyn â'r ysgol ei hun, oherwydd eich bod chi ddim yno, ac nawr mae gennych yr holl storïau gwahanol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2635.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Felly, eto, rwy'n gobeithio y byddai rhywbeth wedi dod allan o'r ysgol yn dweud beth sydd wedi digwydd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6512.872s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Is it possible, maybe, if there's some type of hotline or something that... I know myself, where I am, we're rolling out a totally different program, so we're piloting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6523.518s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I guess the question is, is there a hotline that you could actually be doing something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6535.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because sometimes it's difficult, though, to go and grab someone in the building and you're at a standstill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1515.863s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: To still go back, I might need Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1520.525s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Caldwell to come back up, if she doesn't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1524.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You keep on saying, or you've kept on saying, that the other schools actually do it in a different manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1529.95s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: They do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1531.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So, I guess my question is that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1535.052s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, I don't want to dictate the principles of the school, but if this might be an issue that is occurring and it might occur again, and it has been something that people have been worried about, why doesn't he do it like the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1582.81s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Because my concern is that now for putting, let's say, all the children with special needs into one classroom, that's a lot for that teacher to be handling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1593.441s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so that, you know, it contributes to everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1597.786s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's a domino effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1599.507s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern is now, you know, one, is it fair to that teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1604.586s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Does he change the teachers around each year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1633.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's something that I think we really need to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1635.885s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Again, we don't want to sit here and dictate what the principals are doing in their own schools, but we do have the right to start questioning this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1643.47s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And this isn't the right, I don't think the way this is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1647.8s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: is probably, you know, thank you, equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1652.144s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's been a very long day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1653.345s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1654.606s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Equitable, and it just doesn't seem fair to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1657.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It doesn't seem fair to the teachers, and there's just so much coming on, and I just, I feel bad for that particular teacher, even though he might be changing each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1667.136s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's still a lot on that one particular teacher that particular year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1670.378s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I think that's something that we really need to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1673.141s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing also is to bring up the middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1676.404s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying to change anything around this year, but I have looked at the numbers and the Andrews has 178, the McGlynn has 148.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1684.32s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that it's because of, you know, certain students have to be at certain schools, but it's a difference of 30 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1691.584s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think there was a difference last year also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1694.486s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I just, I'm not saying to change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1696.707s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying on the record, I want to make sure that we're looking at these numbers for even next year, because if this is going to becoming a trend that, you know, it goes from 10<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1706.403s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to 30 and next year might be 50, there might be a reason why so many students now want to go to one school rather than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1714.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, we're trying to keep the middle schools especially very similar to each other because eventually all these students, we hope, are going to come up to the high school and we don't want to have any animosity between the two schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1778.523s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But that's a huge factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1816.644s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know the transition is on an everyday basis too, but at least if we have another number in a couple of months just to see have we received more children into the McGlynn and how it's looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1832.619s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That's all we're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1833.18s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1843.303s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I'd like parents to understand that that's the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1846.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You just don't want people thinking, oh, everybody's going to one school rather than the other and causing a situation that there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1852.985s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4555.646s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4556.647s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4561.01s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, this report was wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4564.053s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It really gave us an insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4566.335s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It gives everybody an insight of really what was going on during the year, that it wasn't like the doors closed and everybody went off on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4573.2s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I want to thank everyone for really thinking outside the box and really bringing in new and vibrant ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4581.407s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and it seems like it was very successful for many people and for a lot of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4587.247s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: summer time program 10 years and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4590.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was a little personal baby of mine, so I'm really happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4594.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm thrilled that we were able to get students to really see what the vocational school is about and showing them the jewel that it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4604.011s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It has always been the summer program for our adults.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4609.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It just it gives us a little bit and it gives I think everyone a little bit of an insight of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4614.133s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yes, maybe we didn't have the money for certain things, but it didn't stop anyone from going and achieving and providing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4622.081s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I think this report is really an extraordinary important report in that it gives everybody that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4628.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you, and thank you to everyone who really participated in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4637.528s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And a little side bit of the students who didn't maybe walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4641.895s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I knew of a student who actually, not this year, but had received his certification after he had done his summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4650.612s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and I insisted that he wear my son's cap and gowns just to take pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4656.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And at first he was like, no, but it really made a difference and he sent them back to his mother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4662.74s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And for some students, that's the only opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4665.442s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we do have our students that have not walked and we are able to do maybe a cap and gown, even to show some pictures and we'll give them the diplomas here, I think that would be really nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4676.35s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'll get you Mr. Blow tomorrow, first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4678.211s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5313.587s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5315.568s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: To be honest with you, this is 11 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5319.67s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's been 11 years I've either been alternate, well with Paulette, either alternate or delegate or president of the organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5328.455s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And to be honest, I don't know about anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5331.536s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If anybody else would love to do this, I would love to see them there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5335.979s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Honestly, I haven't checked my calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5337.96s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know I'm going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5339.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've been going down for 11 years, but either that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5343.978s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Either that or we just check our calendars to see who's definitely going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5347.559s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And maybe we'll table this to the following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5352.981s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We should have one, but we can certainly... But to definitely urge people to tell you if they're going to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5365.085s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The following week, aren't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5374.668s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Yeah, but it's very important that you do tell the Superintendent ASAP who is going down because that way they can book the rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5810.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5811.649s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5811.989s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5813.11s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to piggyback on what the superintendent said, again, I want to congratulate the football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5819.717s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5820.818s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a great community night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5822.42s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It was a beautiful weather night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5825.383s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our cheerleaders did an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5827.725s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The marching band did an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5829.947s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And our new organization that's out there that's kind of taken over a little bit of the old pep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5835.503s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: group that we used to have are now called the staying gang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5838.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And it was just a great, great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5842.004s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, you know, first of all, definitely, if you have the opportunity to go on the website, it's mpsa, I'm sorry, mpsadvantage.education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5854.007s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Please go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5855.367s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It shows and tells you everything that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5858.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But just a couple of things this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5861.088s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you just want to go out and help our schools and help the community, the crew team is having their first fundraiser at Salvatores on the 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5870.708s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: from 7 to 9.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5872.61s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Our foreign language club is having their car wash at the high school on the 14th from 2.30 to 4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5880.137s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: On the 17th, we have the fourth Crystal Campbell motorcycle run that starts at 8 o'clock at the VFW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5886.842s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And then after that run, we urge you to come to Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5893.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No, a motorcycle run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5895.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It starts at 8 for registration, but 11 o'clock for... Much later, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5900.955s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Well, if you're going to be on the motorcycle, you have to be there at 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5904.697s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Medford High School Marching Band is having their huge fundraiser at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5909.84s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It starts at 5 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5911.281s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: There are nine bands from all over New England that come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5916.424s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think I have everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5917.544s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I also want to congratulate Mrs. Van der Kloot and her husband, who are the grand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5924.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: to a newborn, well, he's a few weeks old now, six weeks, to Charles Scott Ryan, who was born on July 31st, and that is her second grandson, and he's absolutely beautiful, just like her first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5935.716s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.168s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.348s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Conyo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=579.969s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Welcome, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=582.871s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If Mr. McLaughlin doesn't mind coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=589.414s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know we have the report in front of us, and we know that the report is available to everyone, but is it possible, John, just to go over a few things that you've done so that way people are aware of what's been going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=870.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mayor Burke, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=872.249s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cunha, just while we're on that, I know that we have to repair them because of safety issues, and that's definitely something that has to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=880.452s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: My concern, though, is that when we go into the capital planning, is that I just don't want to start seeing patches everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=889.295s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: and things starting to look old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=891.836s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If we're going to patch it up and we're going to fix it, I totally understand and doing it now, but I also want to make sure that it looks the same when we go into the capital planning or if it's going to look the same as you repair it because I mean the cosmetic part of it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=908.822s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: needs to be looked at, you know, looked at it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=911.463s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I want to make sure everything just stays on page and that everything still looks as new as we possibly can make it look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=918.045s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Instead of, I just don't want to go to any of the schools and start seeing, you know, like one curb looking this way and another curb looking another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=943.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Right, and that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=948.391s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I know that you and your staff and everyone involved has done a tremendous job over the summer and I really thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=954.878s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=956.159s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The carpet in the front where the community, not the community schools is, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=960.543s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The bathroom is where the pool is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=962.886s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we had put it in there temporarily, but it's still very bubbled up because it wasn't laid down properly when it was first done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=971.594s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I think it's ready for either to get pulled out and yeah because that is a safety issue because kids are walking on that and it keeps on rattling, not rattling, wrapping up that you can trip on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=985.888s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=987.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that was one and the other thing is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=990.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm very happy to see the painting outside and the crosswalks and all that, but I'm looking still for my signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=997.233s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Where are the signs that say, like, slow down, school entrance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1001.476s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We need those signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1002.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1004.078s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I've seen them in different cities and towns, and it's just, I know that everybody, you know, we know that the school is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1017.508s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The vocational side, but the hill coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1019.87s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The temporary ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1020.951s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1021.431s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The hill coming down is really... I've been out there many a times, especially at night during the summertime, and I know people always think it's the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1031.0s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's really not the kids driving those vehicles that are spinning around that corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1035.303s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And my concern, and that's been brought up many a times, so I'm happy that we're looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1041.428s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And again, it's common sense, you see kids, you're in a school area, you're supposed to slow down, but if we could stop putting up the signs for it, it would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1197.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just going to piggyback on that and actually a couple of years ago we all had, we all made it a point that we had meetings that were set up to go and visit all the schools and look through all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1209.815s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we could do that and include the Tufts, you know, Curtis Tufts School and include all the rest of the schools and we could incorporate that into one of our meetings, our subcommittee meeting, so that way it gives everybody the opportunity to do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1223.967s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We all have walked into the schools separately, but if we're going to be looking at this and we're going to be looking at a capital plan that's coming up, I think it'd all be good if we're on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1912.328s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1913.088s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that we have the calendar in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1915.591s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make it clear that last year, not last year, but the previous academic year, we had Monday nights designated for our meetings and our subcommittee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1926.562s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Are we also going to have that extra night during the week that we're going to make it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1932.102s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1933.042s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So if we have subcommittee meetings, we know it's going to be Mondays and Wednesdays, Mondays and Thursdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1937.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or how are we going to work it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1943.787s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing is that since we are starting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1948.104s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'd like to request that we have Glenn Kutcher come from the MASC, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1954.832s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So that way he could go over the rules, regulations, and everything of what school board members are supposed to do and what our roles are all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1964.604s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2437.617s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2437.797s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2439.018s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2439.899s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know the superintendent said that everyone sat down during the summer and went over a lot of this and that's how you came up with the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2446.563s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But did you sit down with like each and every principal of each school and that's what it was kind of their wish list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2452.067s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or is it just from the site council reports that we got last, you know, last spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2458.671s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Or how did, how did it really come about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2507.426s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And the other thing is that again, I just wanna keep in mind, I know that this is definitely a wish list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2512.968s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm hoping that a lot of the things that are on here will be accomplished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2518.409s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But just to go back to the comment that you just made to the superintendent, is that I know it's not to always beautify everything and we have to do things that are necessities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2528.972s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But we also have to always keep in mind is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2532.793s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: When these schools were built, and the refurbishing of a lot of the things that we're doing in the high school, is that we still always want to make them look as best as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2544.359s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: People are still out here, including myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2547.54s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I always joked around, and I said that the new schools are always going to be addressed as the new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2552.218s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: until another school is built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2553.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Like this high school was always the new high school, and it's still considered the new high school for some people, and it was built 45, 40 some years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2562.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that that is a promise that I know we as school committee members, I know the mayor, even before being in the position that she is in now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2572.29s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: has always made the commitment to the city is that we want to make sure that what we have stays as pretty and as new as possible because we know we're not going to have those finances down the road to start building new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2585.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So even though that we're fixing and building, I want to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2589.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That it's not patchwork again, and I know it's been reconfirmed that we're not going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2594.751s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But I also want to make sure that when someone comes through your doors, it's like if you're at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2601.677s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know what you need to fix, you know what you want to do, but you also want to make sure that your home always looks beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2607.622s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we deal with that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2613.266s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2613.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2645.163s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2646.504s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Point of information, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2647.624s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Columbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2647.964s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That I'm on the site council for that, and that was something that we discussed as the site council, but we knew it was part of the operations, and there is work going on and process going on that that was definitely something that we were going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2658.928s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: It's not necessarily the capital planning, but it is internal processing, and as far as I know, that was something that was still being looked at and something that was going to be accomplished this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2979.361s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Just to go back on the module units, and I'm not going to get myself fixated on this, but just to try to figure out where we're going, I mean, we had so many students up at the school for so many years, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2992.756s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And I'm going to throw out a question like I know it's going to come to us, you know, from parents that are in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2998.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We came to this high school and we had a thousand students in each class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3003.422s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I mean, the mayor and myself were part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3006.344s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And so times that by four, we had 4,000 students up here and we had enough room for a lot of the things that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3013.728s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So I'm trying to wrap my brain around why is it now that we don't have enough room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3019.012s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I understand there's more offices set up, and I understand that there is different developed programs that maybe we have now that we didn't have previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3028.76s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: But if you could just work on that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3118.322s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for the clarification, because I know that's definitely going to be something that's going to be asked around in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3123.768s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, again, if we're thinking of modular units, and we're thinking of putting them where the skateboard area was, I guess, I just don't want a picture like, I've seen how other cities and towns are building their schools, and then all of a sudden, they've built their school that they don't have enough students, and they don't have enough space for their students, and I see these trailers and things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3144.898s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to see anything like that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3196.639s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I just want to make clear that if that's where we're going to go, not that I'm saying that we are, it's that type of building that I'd like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3205.446s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4117.27s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4117.69s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: First of all, thanks, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4118.65s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Patterson, for being here and thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4123.14s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I was reading your resume and it says that your budget exceeds $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4127.408s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is the largest budget you have worked with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4166.155s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4167.216s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And have you, when you mentioned the project that you worked on, again, I know it was in a similar, maybe similar, but it was a lesser scale, as we're discussing tonight about our capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4180.087s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So could you maybe compare a little bit of what you have worked on compared to what you think we're going to be working on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4240.924s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, so basically that's what I was going to ask you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4243.285s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What type of a financial director are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4246.066s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: If you wanted to explain to us what a daily day routine would be for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4251.628s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that it changes day by day, but the main basis of the way you work with the district you're in or with the district that you're going to be in, if you want to share that with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4683.5s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: the transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4684.961s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And if we have a parent that calls you and says, you know, this particular bus is overcrowded and no one's getting on or we're having a situation, what would you do in that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6619.438s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening and thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6621.698s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Could you tell me what is the largest fiscal system you've worked for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6626.299s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: The largest fiscal system that you've worked for, like the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6656.533s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: So around 52 to 54 million you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6660.217s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Okay, and describe yourself as the financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6664.682s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What type of schedule, what type of person, when you come in in the morning, what you would do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6842.674s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And as you've probably heard, I mean, we've discussed, well, we've asked questions and spoke about busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6849.939s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Here, the financial director would also be involved with the busing situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6854.242s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: How would you take care of a situation that arose on a particular day of a parent calling you and saying, you know, this bus is overcrowded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6863.609s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: You know, what would you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7524.006s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Good evening, and thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7525.467s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7526.487s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Thank you for being patient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7527.448s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: We ran over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7530.009s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: What is the largest fiscal system that you have worked for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7533.191s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That would be Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7534.292s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: And how much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7541.008s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: OK, and have you, what about the school side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7543.889s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: That was the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7544.629s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: Oh, that was the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7548.831s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I like to bring your money, to bring your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7553.733s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7554.433s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm just trying to put things in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7557.675s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>
