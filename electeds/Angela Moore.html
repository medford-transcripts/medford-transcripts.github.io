 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16185.645s">So</a> I just wanted to say on a different note that I'm, as someone who has spoken up in Metro politics for a number of years, I'm really happy to see new people and old people <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16198.352s">older</a> people um speaking up and having a voice And having a way to communicate to maybe come together to find the medford that we all believe we deserve um <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16210.978s">I</a> don't know what the answer is for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16213.46s">I</a> am afraid that in-person meetings will be dangerous as someone that is at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16222.246s">And</a> there's so many components that I think we don't understand as not being healthcare professionals or public health professionals that we haven't even taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16236.337s">as</a> much as I recognize why people want to be in person as much as I recognize why I would like to look someone in the eye when I tell them the decision i'm making um I think we just need to take a step back and recognize that We are still in the middle of a pandemic and while some of us feel like we're living more of a normal life <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16259.54s">Those</a> of us that are still worried about getting sick or making our loved ones sick Or understand that just a simple trip to the grocery store could Bring it home to someone that we live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16272.966s">Um</a> I just ask you all take that into consideration When the decision comes about how this meeting is going to work in the future since our budget is obviously going to have to be passed at some point <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16286.14s">So</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16287.601s">I</a> appreciate where you're all coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16289.102s">I</a> do not think being a politician is easy I do not think what any of you are doing right now is easy And I do appreciate that You're sitting there and you're listening and change is not easy and nobody likes to be made feel uncomfortable um, but it is probably a time of reflection for our city and I as one know that i'm trying to take that <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16312.85s">into</a> consideration as I talk to my children and the people I meet and the people I know and my understanding of what Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16320.675s">So</a> that's just all I had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16323.637s">Thanks</a> to everybody who's hung in there this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16325.458s">I</a> am really happy to see that this is where Medford is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16330.942s">And</a> I'm really happy to know that in the future, perhaps people like me won't be the only one sitting alone in city council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16337.526s">So</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16338.467s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU/2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU.html">School Committee 05/07/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6826.936s">These</a> sirens are going off everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6828.537s">Is</a> there a way to include the new superintendent-elect in those?
 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7488.541s">Can</a> I just continue with what we also wanted to speak about, and something that I brought to your attention two years ago, and if it had been properly acted upon, we would not really be in the situation we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7503.731s">And</a> two years ago, I did ask for a solid succession plan for the superintendent position. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7510.055s">At</a> the time, I do believe it was misconstrued, and people thought it was simply me saying about Mr. Bellison, but it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7516.519s">It</a> could have been anybody sitting up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7519.173s">And</a> now we're poised to hire a new superintendent and there's still no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7524.536s">I</a> felt at the time the request was definitely belittled and ultimately the plan that was presented included the scenario we're actually placed in now where there's an untimely or unexpected vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7538.422s">And</a> I just want to read exactly what the plan that was put forth actually says. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7542.964s">It</a> says, if the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for any reason, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7548.306s">the</a> deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7552.849s">And</a> then it goes on, but we wouldn't have to do a school committee search, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7556.652s">The</a> current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7565.518s">We</a> have an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration, director of pupil services, director of building and grounds, as well as assistant principals, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7575.194s">and</a> departmental directors in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7576.915s">Each</a> would be able to carry out their essential functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7580.578s">So</a> with that being said, I'm not really sure why we're in a situation where we had to reverse a decision if this is what was put forth as the succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7594.368s">If</a> a proper plan had been in place, I don't think it could have been proposed or justified that your decision was reversed because of a lack of a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7605.535s">or</a> that their people that were supposed to be taxed with the job were not available to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7611.757s">Ultimately,</a> I think it just highlights what our community is feeling, that we're not being heard, that you're unwilling to actually be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7619.56s">I</a> mean, it was almost exactly two years ago that I asked for something to be done, and it's still not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7626.523s">And</a> now we're hiring a new superintendent, and we're still going to be at ground zero for what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7633.387s">I</a> mean, we know now what a search involves. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7636.695s">and</a> we know what we want, but all of this needs to be in place before, I believe, before Mr. Belson leaves because you're obviously going to need his input. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7646.217s">So</a> what I'm asking for you tonight is an actual commitment and a date to have an actual solid succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7655.1s">Like</a> I said, I believe Mr. Belson's input will be invaluable because there's just a lot of policy and <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7660.658s">knowledge</a> in his head that needs to be put in writing somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7664.62s">There's</a> boilerplate plans that you can get that are fairly inexpensive that can sort of bring this along more quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7671.242s">Ultimately</a> it needs to be done now and it all just ties back to a better engagement of engaging your community and like I said, I know I was belittled and it's just a lack of respect for community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7684.487s">It's</a> the we know better, how dare you ask, we can handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7690.248s">And</a> that's unfortunate.

 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3280.115s">Hi,</a> Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3281.876s">My</a> name is Angela Monsell-Moore, and I'm a candidate for one of the six school committee seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3287.118s">By</a> way of introduction, my family moved to Medford from Ireland when I was six, and I started in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3294.78s">I</a> graduated from Medford High in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3297.822s">I</a> have a degree in biochemistry and religious studies, as well as radiological sciences, x-ray technology, and I'm a certified kickboxing and Muay Thai instructor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3307.777s">My</a> husband and I decided to stay in Medford and raise our four children here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3312.459s">My</a> twins are in their second year of college. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3315.541s">I</a> have a son that is a sixth grader at the Andrews and a daughter that is a fourth grader at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3320.563s">As</a> a graduate of Medford Public Schools and now a parent of students in the schools, I have a unique perspective on what seems to work well within our schools and what could be improved upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3331.589s">Knowing</a> children in Medford that attend schools at each level, from elementary through high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3336.737s">as</a> well as interacting with parents at all levels, has allowed me an opportunity to gain insights into the strengths of our schools, as well as the concerns of parents and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3347.484s">Throughout</a> this campaign, many people have asked me why am I running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3352.448s">My</a> answer is simple, and it's always the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3355.55s">I</a> believe in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3357.891s">I</a> believe our schools can be even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3360.493s">I</a> believe children deserve the best possible education, no matter what their abilities or resources are. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3367.557s">I</a> know I can add a new dimension to the school committee and am of the opinion that I can't expect anyone else to do a job I'm not willing to do myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3376.641s">Among</a> the issues I would promote as a committee member is the continued progress being made at the Medford Vocational Technical High School and Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3384.605s">Medford</a> is one of the only local communities that's fortunate enough to have both schools as part of one campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3390.923s">Efforts</a> to integrate both schools need to continue with academic opportunities for the students of the voc tech expanding and career and technical opportunities for high school students being cultivated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3402.132s">New</a> shops as well as renovations and acquiring up-to-date equipment should be a top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3407.476s">I</a> truly believe career and technical education needs to be prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3412.139s">Not</a> every student will take an academic path toward a four-year college. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3416.907s">We</a> need to make sure the education we provide them ensures they will be well prepared and successful in the careers they chose. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3423.592s">Bolstering</a> our community education offerings could provide revenue to see this progress continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3429.577s">My</a> oldest children were among the first class of students to attend the new elementary schools from kindergarten through fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3436.582s">Throughout</a> the years, these schools have not been funded for proper maintenance, forcing reactive repairs versus proactive routine yearly maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3443.89s">In</a> order for these buildings to properly serve Medford students for the long term, it is essential that a proper maintenance schedule be funded and implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3453.132s">My</a> family is fortunate enough to be able to walk to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3456.153s">With</a> that being said, I am acutely aware of the safety challenges students face while traveling to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3462.334s">Issues</a> with bus safety, overcrowding, and scheduling are recurring each year and should be addressed. <a

 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2387.29s">Good</a> evening and thank you school committee, um, Mr. Superintendent and Madam Mayor for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2393.595s">Um,</a> I spoke before you on April 11th and I asked the committee to have a transparent succession plan for the position of superintendent in place by June of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2404.143s">On</a> May 3rd, I attended the city council meeting and was very surprised to learn that in the superintendent's contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2411.987s">It</a> states that the school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract by June 30, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2419.95s">I</a> was disappointed to hear this from a city Councilor given the fact four committee members were part of the negotiations for the current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2426.893s">That</a> information could have been relayed to me when I spoke on April 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2431.695s">With</a> that being said, I would assume the committee will have a plan in place by the given date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2435.777s">This</a> is probably the most important role that you as a school committee member <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2439.43s">will</a> play in your tenure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2440.591s">It's</a> your legacy as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2442.893s">You</a> can get this right or you can get this very wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2446.015s">I</a> followed up with each of you individually via email, and again, did not receive a response from the majority of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2451.679s">From</a> those that did respond, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2454.481s">What</a> I'm asking from you is to devise a plan in the event Medford needs to hire a new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2459.545s">You've</a> not been faced with such a task in over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2463.748s">And</a> if the need did arise any time soon, you would have no guidelines set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2468.569s">Such</a> a situation would surely result in panic and a haphazard process of finding a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2474.515s">Ultimately,</a> this is not about Mr. Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2477.518s">However,</a> the fact that it is the catalyst for such a discussion cannot be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2481.923s">I'm</a> speaking to you as a citizen you have been elected to represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2485.987s">I'm</a> also speaking to you on behalf of the 250 other residents <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2490.109s">that</a> have signed both an online and paper petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2492.971s">I'm</a> frustrated a petition had to be started asking you to do your due diligence and ensure that proper measures are being taken regarding filling one of the most important positions in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2502.916s">This</a> is not just a small group of people with a sudden sense of urgency that are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2508.219s">These</a> are your constituents, and this is a plan that should always have been in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2512.962s">With</a> all of that being said, I will reiterate the questions I have regarding the process for renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2518.907s">and</a> the subsequent questions should a contract not be renewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2522.19s">Please</a> feel free to take notes and answer when I'm done speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2525.393s">As</a> I said before, this plan is not just about this contract, but since this contract is the one being renewed, it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2533.12s">I</a> understand Mr. Belson is currently working on a self-evaluation as stated in his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2538.004s">I</a> further understand you will then begin your process of evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2541.696s">Given</a> you are obligated to work on this as a committee, at what point do you discuss your evaluations if the superintendent is always present at every meeting and every executive session? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2551.122s">Is</a> this process made public and is there an opportunity for public input? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2555.665s">Is</a> Mr. Belson's contract automatically extended on June 30th if your evaluations determine he is performing in a satisfactory manner? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2564.291s">At</a> this point, I feel your lack of a succession plan will truly come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2568.353s">If</a> Mr. Belson announces at a later date that he plans on retiring, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2571.689s">What</a> is your plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2573.55s">A</a> plan should answer the following questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2575.93s">What</a> are the guidelines put forth with respect to renewing the superintendent's contract and finding a replacement? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2582.292s">These</a> guidelines should include, but not be limited to, evaluation of the current superintendent as set forth by the terms in his contract, allowing the school committee to do their own evaluation and discuss said evaluations without the superintendent present, gathering input from the community regarding their evaluations, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2600.478s">If</a> the contract is renewed, it should be clearly documented how recent and longstanding issues within the school system will be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2607.923s">Clearly</a> stated and documented requirements for a successor should be put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2614.268s">The</a> guidelines should coherently document what the initiatives and direction of Medford Public Schools are and how they will be sustained by a successor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2622.854s">You</a> need to evaluate the potential for an internal replacement and the eligibility requirements for such a vertical career move. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2630.675s">You</a> need to establish a timeline for searching for and transitioning in a replacement, allowing time for a replacement to work alongside the current superintendent if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2641.219s">And</a> lastly, you need to determine how to record and maintain the knowledge that Mr. Belson does currently possess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2646.961s">It's</a> a vast amount of knowledge and it's a vast network that he has created. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2652.202s">And</a> you need to know how to relay that to a successor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2655.147s">What</a> I'm proposing should be a matter of routine governing within the realm of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2660.132s">As</a> stated by one resident who signed the petition, succession planning is critical for a smooth search and leadership transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2668.281s">We</a> need the school committee to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2670.823s">As</a> our elected representatives, they should implement a thoughtful, transparent process that prioritizes community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2678.562s">I</a> urge you to complete this process sooner rather than later and avoid the possibility of panic in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2684.784s">There</a> is indeed a sense of urgency since a proper search and transition should a replacement be needed will likely take a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2691.225s">Now</a> is the time you should be organizing yourselves and preparing yourself to take action if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2696.327s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2979.405s">I</a> would just like to follow up to that to say that I am actually a very proud product of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2987.209s">My</a> children attend Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2989.47s">I</a> am extraordinarily aware <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2992.116s">of</a> what Medford Public Schools have done, what they can do, and I hope to God what they will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2997.823s">So</a> for you to sit there and say that I don't appreciate what goes on in the Medford Public Schools is an outright travesty. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3004.592s">With</a> that being said, I am not asking you <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3009.072s">to</a> simply sit there and say if you're going to renew or not renew Mr. Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3013.336s">What</a> I'm asking you is to have a transparent process if it has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3018.64s">If,</a> God forbid, he couldn't perform his job tomorrow, what is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3023.284s">And</a> you'll say it's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3024.745s">Well,</a> then why did I stand here in front of you in April and not one of you had the audacity, not one of you could say anything to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3032.391s">You</a> didn't acknowledge that I was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3034.933s">So</a> don't tell me that's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3038.054s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Benedetto.

 <p>[Angela Moore]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=569.676s">OK,</a> that's understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=571.636s">I</a> just feel like the process of selecting a new superintendent, it's a lengthy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=575.837s">In</a> order for it to be carried out properly, a search committee should be convened before the 2016 school year ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=583.219s">It's</a> imperative that the time over the summer is not wasted and that the process is started before the start of the 2016-2017 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=591.861s">Ideally,</a> if you are planning on retiring, a candidate would be able to work throughout the school year with you to ease the transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=599.063s">If</a> you don't plan on retiring, then there's been some issues and concerns that have been in the forefront this school year and they should be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=607.929s">I</a> think throughout the recent mayoral election it became evident that the citizens of Medford really expressed a strong desire for change and to move beyond the status quo that's been governing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=619.676s">That</a> same desire for change and to eradicate stagnation extends to the school system as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=625.995s">The</a> Medford public school system, the students, and the parents do not exist within these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=630.638s">You,</a> the school committee members, need to reach out to the constituents you represent and determine the future they want for Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=638.804s">This</a> job mandates that you act in the best interest of the school system and the students it educates, and that decisions made regarding the schools are made with input from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=648.05s">I'm</a> asking each of you to do your research regarding what the citizens want and to be proactive rather than reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=654.915s">when</a> it comes to filling the position of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=657.698s">With</a> that being said, and since time is of the essence, I would like to suggest that a transparent succession plan be in place by June of this year, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=665.264s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=667.546s">Thank</a> you very much.
