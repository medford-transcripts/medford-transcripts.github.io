    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2699.579s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you to the organizers for this event tonight, so that these candidates can come and bring our message to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2707.363s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Capucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2708.363s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm 47 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2710.164s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm the youngest of seven kids in my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2712.825s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm a lifelong Medford resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2715.406s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I graduated from Franklin Pierce College in 1994.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2718.828s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I went into teaching, and then after a few years of that, I joined the Army Reserves, and I currently work in electronics, making laser scalpels for a company up in Lexington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2729.743s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I heard a lot of the candidates touch upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2732.62s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The issues that were sent to us, the city committee here sent us actually 30 different topics to discuss with five minutes to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2742.746s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I chose five, and I'm going to just answer them directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2746.449s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The number one I chose was the opioid crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2750.471s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I lost my best friend in 2003 to drug addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2755.374s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A couple weeks ago, at 46 years old, he had to bury a high school graduate, a classmate of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2761.818s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's the number one killer of people under 50 years old in America, and it needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2769.203s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think Medford should start leading the way in research and how many prescriptions are actually being given for opioids, to whom, for what purposes, and to investigate to our fullest to ensure every single prescription is right and proper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2783.333s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I will continue to support and advocate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2785.701s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for worthwhile community programs like candlelight vigils, various drug addiction rehab facilities and groups, and other initiatives we have here in Medford such as Team Medford and the new drug officer recently appointed by the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2801.669s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'd also like to establish here in Medford a kind of a tough love approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2806.767s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and send out coordinated, communicated messages to all the residents on a regular basis to get people to realize their problem and light a fire under their butts to get the help that they need so they stop dying and they can enjoy the holidays, child graduations, weddings, all the things that make this life worth living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2829.675s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The Medford City Council should start leading the way on this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2833.937s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The next topic I want to talk about is inclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2837.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think the best way we can be more inclusive of our diversity here in Medford is something that I've been calling for throughout my campaign and for years before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2851.362s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and it was highlighted just last night in these chambers by the excellent speech of Dr. John Stirella of Metcalf Street in two words, term limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2861.877s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If we had a three-term term limit for the elected right now in Medford, there would be five open seats on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2868.846s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for this city to take advantage of and run for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2872.147s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There would be four seats on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2874.208s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We'd have two new challenging candidates for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2878.349s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Nothing else would lead the way to include the diverse population we have in Medford so that we can hear from all different kinds of people to come up here and act, all different new ideas, new initiatives to include all of Medford in our wonderful city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2894.455s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2895.535s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I recently had a conversation with the manager of Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2900.013s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We discussed something that was recently featured on a news program, Chronicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2904.876s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That report was called the Amazon effect, whereby mom-and-pop shops across Medford, across Massachusetts, across the country are getting walloped because more people can easily just go online and order from various, you know, internet services, and they're not being able to keep up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2926.423s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: these internet companies, the mom and pop shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2928.987s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So what cities and towns are doing to combat this and make our city squares more attractive is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2935.864s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Offer no-fee parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2938.446s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I lead the way to get us out of the contract with Republic Parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2942.048s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need to revitalize these city squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2944.05s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2945.471s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If we offer no-fee parking with strict two-hour limits so that we don't have that problem we used to have that's probably still going on on the outskirts of the city, we make sure that people that come here and park and leave their cars all day, after two hours, they're towed at their own expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2964.123s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2966.075s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I am actually for the city to collect more taxes and have more taxes in their coffers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2973.92s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need these funds for hiring more police, firefighters, teachers, teachers' aides, infrastructure repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2981.425s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What I don't believe in... 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2983.686s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Oh, really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2984.026s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That quick already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2985.007s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Gee whiz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2987.82s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Well, what I don't believe in is constantly raising the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2991.282s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What I think is what we do is we create more taxpayers, and the way we do that is to cut taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2996.605s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: With my last few seconds, I want to make an appeal to the 28,000 registered voters who don't vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3002.789s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Come out and vote on November 7th for Robert Cappucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3005.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3006.351s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That was really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.247s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Testing, 1, 2, 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.727s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.907s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3384.034s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3386.475s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3387.655s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3391.601s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3398.765s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3410.072s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3414.335s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3415.736s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3416.616s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution, there are laws that govern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3419.642s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3422.785s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3438.96s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're subverting the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3441.075s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3451.38s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3457.142s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3465.286s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3473.792s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: On the state level, among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3480.057s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3483.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the costs coming in don't—<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3487.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3500.994s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think that for a city like Medford, for a group like Safe Medford to come along and, you know, this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3514.717s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a matter of respect for the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3517.958s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: in becoming a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3521.761s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3539.62s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3546.862s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the guise of the feel good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3558.484s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll leave you with this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3561.825s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is Medford being a welcoming city by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3566.24s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: basically subverting the rule of U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3568.583s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3579.735s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When a new resident or a new business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3582.217s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3591.003s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3597.987s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are the city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3599.088s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3602.17s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's a welcoming city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3604.752s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3605.953s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3611.637s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3612.778s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3614.3s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5364.0s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5365.061s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5366.803s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5369.125s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5373.746s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5377.009s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5380.753s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5398.792s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5404.814s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5422.339s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear mongering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5429.262s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5432.088s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also want to address the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5434.91s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5445.234s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with limited government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5448.315s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5453.917s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5461.04s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In the current policy of not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5463.564s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: ask an immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5465.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5470.75s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5477.332s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5490.936s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5496.697s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5511.288s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Massachusetts never signed on to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5513.598s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5516.722s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I really don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5518.684s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5530.539s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5534.482s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5539.105s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5543.368s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5551.233s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And those laws have to be respected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5553.955s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5557.967s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5559.128s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever was in power of immigration to know where to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5580.409s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So it's actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5582.931s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4067.982s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4070.424s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4071.564s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4075.526s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4082.67s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4093.997s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4098.24s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4099.641s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4100.521s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution, there are laws that govern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4103.553s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4106.696s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4122.83s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4129.494s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4135.257s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4141.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4157.726s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: On the state level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4159.969s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4163.972s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4166.995s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4184.93s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think that for a city like Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4189.269s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for a group like Safe Medford to come along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4192.273s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4198.641s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4205.28s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4223.562s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4230.808s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4242.417s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll leave you with this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4245.779s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is Medford being a welcoming city by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4250.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: basically subverting the rule of U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4252.508s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4263.682s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When a new resident or a new business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4266.145s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4274.934s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4281.921s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are the city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4283.043s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4286.106s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's a welcoming city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4288.688s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4289.861s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4295.566s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4297.347s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4298.208s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6048.013s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6049.093s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6050.834s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6053.156s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6057.776s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6061.039s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6064.783s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6082.819s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6088.844s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6106.377s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6113.289s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6116.115s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also want to address the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6118.937s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6129.246s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with limited government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6132.328s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6137.933s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6145.038s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In the current policy of not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6147.521s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: ask an immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6149.163s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6154.77s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6161.36s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6174.946s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6180.708s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6195.298s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Massachusetts never<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6197.591s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6200.692s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I really don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6202.653s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6214.518s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6218.46s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6223.102s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6227.344s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6235.227s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And those laws have to be respected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6237.288s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6241.963s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6243.104s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6264.374s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6272.88s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're actually putting a target on their back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5175.883s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This council informed me, which I then informed my neighbors on Evans Street, that Evans Street wasn't on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5188.335s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And DPW workers came to Evans Street and they mapped out with colored spray paint the water pipes on Evans Street that are going to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5198.599s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And we were told, a friend of mine, one of my neighbors, Shawna Smith, has a friend in DPW who told her that work would begin on September 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5208.664s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's September 19th, the work hasn't begun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7447.889s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's disparaging for 30 houses on Evans Street to be paying taxes for the last 67 years in the tune of millions of dollars and not have proper basic services done for the residents of Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6896.484s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And how can you say that they're going to do water main repair without, I mean, to get to the water main, you have to dig up the street, so obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7027.772s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I wish the residents on my street weren't told that it was going to be done in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7052.08s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In a city that, through different accounts, I mean, I sat through all the subcommittee meetings on the budget, and I see how expenditures not paid get thrown back into the general fund, to where it's now ballooned into tens of millions of dollars, and to tell any resident, the people that came up before, on brookings or curbs, or go up Adam Street on the hillside, go on any street up in the heights, for this city to be sitting on so much money,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7426.987s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Just really brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7428.228s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I completely understand what Councilor Marks is saying, but on the flip side, what Councilor Lungo-Koehn is saying is the presentation of these appropriations coming in as dire and needed and at the last minute to invoke that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7491.749s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I understand that council of Councilor Knight, but when they do come up at the midnight hour I I don't think that this resolution lacks teeth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7501.972s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think what council Lungo current is doing astutely is Sending a message not only to the mayor but a separate message to the the people that you guys represent that we are gonna do something about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8703.908s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8714.457s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that was just hastily written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8716.538s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It wasn't notarized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8717.919s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It wasn't written under perjury or penalty, going back on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8723.842s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Considering the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8733.168s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8740.092s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The money essentially is already gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8743.153s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Essentially, it's already gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8744.673s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8747.614s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we did... I was only notified by one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8754.956s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know who else has bowed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8756.777s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8761.378s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: After discussion from some of the candidates, it wasn't hidden from other people who signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8769.861s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8771.781s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8778.223s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8780.284s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8781.505s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8791.108s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8804.053s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Something that weighed heavy on my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8805.977s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8816.778s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Why I reconsidered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8818.618s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Two people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8822.459s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm an adult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8823.139s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I can make my own decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8824.58s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8830.521s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I won't mention any names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8833.081s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll just say that it made better sense, and it was better judgment, and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8846.824s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Full disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8852.327s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8876.398s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Your mind changed as well at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=8879.883s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9013.634s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think what Councilor Lungo-Koehn is doing astutely is sending a message not only to the mayor, but a separate message to the people that you guys represent, that we are going to do something about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9028.577s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: your taxpayer dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9029.818s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10211.085s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10212.125s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10215.587s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10226.153s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that was just hastily written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10228.234s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It wasn't notarized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10229.634s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It wasn't written under perjury or penalty going back on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10235.555s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Considering the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10244.858s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10251.799s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The money essentially is already gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10254.866s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Essentially, it's already gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10256.388s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10259.332s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we... I was only notified by one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10265.94s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10266.68s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know who else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10268.483s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10272.577s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: on after discussion from some of the candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10276.081s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It wasn't hidden from other people who signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10281.566s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10283.488s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10291.997s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10293.218s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10302.826s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10315.756s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Something that weighed heavy on my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10317.678s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10321.403s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I am not obligated to to have to disclose reasons<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10328.472s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: why I reconsidered are two people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10331.513s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I am 47 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10334.154s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm an adult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10334.854s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I can make my own decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10336.294s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact, and I won't mention any names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10344.676s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I'll just say that it made better sense and it was better judgment and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10358.54s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Full disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10364.022s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10365.943s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I greatly respect you for bringing that home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10379.649s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I understand that, but things happen and people change their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10384.471s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: People change their mind all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10388.112s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Your mind changed as well at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10391.575s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=3704.754s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That fixed rate that's being offered per kilowatt hour, is that locked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=3710.416s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Like, what happens if something comes up in the future where they could get a lower rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=3714.978s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Could we opt for the lower rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=3716.479s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10020.699s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Bringing in a new business that's offering jobs, that's more revenues for the city of Medford, could be used to offset other things that we need, like police and equipment for the firefighters and fixing streets and roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10033.026s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10033.766s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Number two, I think Nick and Michelle made a really good case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10037.468s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to address some of the points that were just made about a lack of smell, about a lack of noise, about it being a good location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10046.379s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In reference to what Councilor Knight brought up under the Mass State Laws, I've seen this body of proof permits<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10053.868s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: with stipulations that in six months we'll revisit it to take a look at what the impact was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10059.574s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I hope that you would consider that in considering this business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10073.468s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's not an option for these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10076.491s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I say that based upon the fact that they've done their homework and they've done their research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=10080.393s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I'm confident that within a few months, you won't find the adverse impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5521.114s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I just want to echo a few things from what, uh, Councilor Marks was, was talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5527.399s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Uh, he's mentioned one street that hasn't been done in six decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5532.844s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I've been before the city council before, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5538.412s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And it's a very sad commentary on the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5542.175s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to see a budget of $167 million when residents on my street, Mr. President, were told by at least two Councilors that the repairs that were in dire need, critical condition, were going to be done this May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5561.03s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I came to the city hall and I spoke to the engineer who told me all the red tape it has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5568.696s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: about a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5570.496s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A neighbor of mine told me yesterday that upon speaking to somebody in City Hall, I won't mention any names, said that contract is now having problems, so it doesn't look like our street's gonna be done this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5586.3s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: After being told by several people that it was gonna be done, the residents of Evans Street are outraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5596.384s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Mr. President, when we're paying two income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes that go up every year, a new connectivity fee coming at us in the water tax account that has a surplus in it, to see a $167 million budget that's about to be approved, as Mr. Starewa said, that 80% of it is going towards salaries and the infrastructure repairs not being done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5625.739s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It will be reflected on this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5628.88s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a primary reason why I am running for city council this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5632.901s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This is not a campaign speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5641.772s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Because we need new voices on the city council, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5645.317s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need new people that are going to come in here and have the political will to finally stand up and say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5671.748s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's only going to get $97,000 this year under this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5675.171s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's outrageous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5676.292s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's outrageous, especially when this downtown business district is suffering so much for the extended repair of the Craddock Bridge that's now added another year, another $10 million to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5689.025s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Far too many residents of this community are at their wits end with vital repairs that are not being done and seeing a budget increase to $167 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5701.228s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I respectfully ask you to vote no on this budget until such a time that it reflects adequate responsibility for all the millions of millions of tax dollars that these residents are paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5205.57s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I just want to echo a few things from what, uh, Councilor Marks was, was talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5211.875s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Um, he's mentioned one street that hasn't been done in six decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5215.438s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's, that's my street, Evan street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5217.319s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I've been before the city council before, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5222.873s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And it's a very sad commentary on the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5226.647s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to see a budget of $167 million when residents on my street, Mr. President, were told by at least two Councilors that the repairs that were in dire need, critical condition, were going to be done this May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5245.504s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I came to the city hall and I spoke to the engineer who told me all the red tape it has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5253.18s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: about a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5254.961s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A neighbor of mine told me yesterday that upon speaking to somebody in City Hall, I won't mention any names, said that contract is now having problems, so it doesn't look like our street's going to be done this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5270.75s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: After being told by several people that it was going to be done, the residents of Evans Street are outraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5280.822s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Mr. President, when we're paying two income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes that go up every year, a new connectivity fee coming at us in the water tax account that has a surplus in it, to see a $167 million budget that's about to be approved, as Mr. Storella said, that 80% of it is going towards salaries and the infrastructure repairs not being done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5310.204s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It will be reflected on this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5313.346s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a primary reason why I am running for city council this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5322.153s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5322.493s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If that threatens you, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5325.215s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5326.246s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Because we need new voices on the city council, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5329.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need new people that are going to come in here and have the political will to finally stand up and say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5336.12s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This is not a political step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5338.143s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I know that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5339.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you for reminding me that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5345.852s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The reinvestment in the arts that Councilor Marks spoke to is a stabilizing tax base, especially with that Chevalier Theatre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5356.219s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's only going to get $97,000 this year under this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5359.641s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's outrageous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5360.762s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's outrageous, especially when this downtown business district is suffering so much for the extended repair of the Craddock Bridge that's now added another year, another $10 million to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5373.499s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Far too many residents of this community are at their wits end with vital repairs that are not being done and seeing a budget increase to $167 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5385.682s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I respectfully ask you to vote no on this budget until such a time that it reflects adequate responsibility for all the millions of millions of tax dollars that these residents are paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5398.764s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5399.785s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3306.318s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Just to bring up some of the points that Mr. Penta was talking about, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3313.365s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Tomorrow night, there is a meeting of the Community Preservation Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3318.106s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's at the high school, I believe, at 5 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3321.446s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The funds collected so far is $1,200,000, as I believe you know from the subcommittee meetings on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3331.148s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What you also know, too, is that, I mean, this also connects to what Lisa was saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3336.509s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I forget your last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3337.429s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3340.75s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The property taxes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3343.897s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: in Medford, as the assessor said, are going up an average of 10% to 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3349.741s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And he said that based on historical records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3353.463s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the CPA tax is going to be collecting a lot more money, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3358.526s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: One other clarification I want to make is I was opposed to the CPA in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3364.409s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And when it passed, the very next day after the election, I went to the Office of Elections<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3371.55s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Secretary of State's office, and I asked them, how do we get rid of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3375.956s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And they said, you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3378.619s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There's only one way after five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3381.382s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Now, maybe what Mr. Penta said is true, but they didn't tell me that, about the city council being able to put it on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3387.59s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But what was told to me from the Secretary of State's office is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3391.159s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It can only get on the ballot to be repealed the same way it got on the ballot to be passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3396.7s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And that's you have to go out in citizen effort drive to go out and get the signatures, to get this thing on the ballot, to get it repealed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3404.842s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And one final thing I want to say about the matching from the state is only half of the cities and towns have the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3415.335s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: but all 351 cities and towns pay into the fund that funds the towns that have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3422.639s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So an unfortunate aspect of this is that lesser affluent communities that don't have the CPA end up, through their taxes, funding more affluent towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3435.645s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We really don't need the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3438.027s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I definitely agree with the purposes of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3445.156s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But Medford already sits on surpluses and budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3450.037s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We have a property tax that goes up every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3454.139s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We have surpluses in other accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3456.399s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There are other ways that we can do the objectives of the CPA without having the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3463.581s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And if Mr. Pinter is right of some way of freezing this or reducing it, please,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3470.283s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: By all means, do that, because as the last speaker said, this is what's on the mind of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3475.891s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: How are people going to upkeep their properties when they have the connectivity tax coming at them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3485.765s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: when they have the perpetual property tax, when they have the meals tax, and the sales tax, and two income taxes, and fees to go to Wrights Pond, and fees for this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3495.047s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Gene Neuzil's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3496.247s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This is death by paper cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3499.308s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And this body has the power to do something about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3503.968s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, these are our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3505.889s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We know the people who own these restaurants out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3513.647s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was voted on by the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3514.868s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If you can get it repealed, we'll review the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3519.151s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The people voted it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3520.332s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Right, and I sat at a polling center on election day, and as people came in, Mr. President, and they looked at that doctor's prescription of a ballot question, they went up to the poll worker and they said, hey, can you explain this to me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3534.644s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And when they were told, basically, it's a surcharge on your profit, oh, I'm not voting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3540.125s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're right, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3540.785s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3545.847s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3549.528s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a job well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3550.948s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3563.112s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And that, you're right, it was voted on by the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3568.023s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What did he say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3568.583s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: 1,300 people didn't even vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3570.944s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Most people didn't even turn it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3573.065s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: More effort should be made to clarify exactly what was being voting on, and that there was even a ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3341.988s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: How are people going to upkeep their properties when they have the connectivity tax coming at them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3351.562s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When they have the perpetual property tax, when they have the meals tax, and the sales tax, and two income taxes, and fees to go to Wrights Pond, and fees for this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3361.148s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Gene Neuzil's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3370.053s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, these are our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3371.994s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We know the people who own these restaurants out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3386.421s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Right, and I sat at a polling center on election day, and as people came in, Mr. President, and they looked at that doctor's prescription of a ballot question, they went up to the poll worker, and they said, hey, can you explain this to me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3400.726s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And when they were told, basically, it's a surrogate on your profile, oh, I'm not voting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.203s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.563s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.863s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3411.945s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3415.626s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It was a job well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3417.046s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3434.684s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: 1300 people didn't even vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6673.56s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: bring in enough money by bringing in bigger names with more investment to that almost 2,000 seat theater to see the increase in sales and whatnot to our downtown business district that's being crippled by the Craddock Bridge repair, and then use that money to actually really reduce water rates and property rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10468.738s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a shame and it's disconcerting, and I hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10473.174s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that the public is watching during this election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10476.577s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7865.444s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I want to thank Vice President Marks for bringing this up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7868.646s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, I don't know how many times I've been up here speaking about Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7872.948s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: With all due respect, I respect the intentions of bringing in technology to look at the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7879.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But, you know, as Councilor Marks said, he's gotten, what, how many pictures came in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7885.114s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think we know what the conditions of the roads and streets are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7889.616s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And to try to make it a little bit bigger of a picture,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7895.239s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: These kind of improvements go towards growing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7901.422s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I want more people to move and live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7904.364s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, with the problems we're having with airplanes and everything else, more improvement on parks, which has actually been excellent in the last year and a half, I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7914.87s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The park improvements have been good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7916.791s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But if we add this million dollars,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7919.436s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: To further improve our city and make it aesthetically pleasing and get more people to move here To make our community stronger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7929.922s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think it would be great and to make it a zero-sum game I know the council is in the administration and a lot of people don't want to hear this but perhaps a 20% reduction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7940.338s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and certain pay grades might help to offset certain costs so that we can make these improvements to make our city a much better place to live in, move to, raise a family, and improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7954.324s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, the facade at Medford High School, I think, is still in need of a million dollar repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7960.907s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a figure that I heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7962.047s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I could be speaking out of turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7963.508s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7964.396s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that exactly, but I do know it does need repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7967.798s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And moving forward, I would hope that when you look at this budget that you're going to debate, we look into certain areas, because I took a look at it before coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7980.073s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, to see millions of dollars in the pay grades and having to beg for a necessity like streets and roads kind of makes no sense to the people that are at home watching, seeing their water tax go up, their property taxes go up every year, a surcharge on the property tax, the excise taxes that I think are specifically supposed to be used for street and road improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=8004.072s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And what are we getting for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=8006.153s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A city councilor who has to bring up again<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=733.617s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't want to seem selfish about Evans Street coming up here again, because I know there's a lot of streets and sub water and gas systems across Medford that need to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=746.28s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I'm a little disheartened before this body tonight to come and speak on this matter yet again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=755.283s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Through the administration's office, through the DPW, a letter came out saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=763.48s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Contracts would go out in May for the work that needs to be done on Evan Street that members of this body have said in the past is in the top five of worst condition streets in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=777.831s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When that letter came out, it prompted some city councilors, when they saw it, in good faith, to tell neighbors of mine and myself that work is gonna be done this spring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=790.468s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: specifically this May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=792.389s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So a week and a half ago, one of my neighbors, Mr. Rob McGuire, knowing how often I come to the council meetings and discussions I have with the honorable members of this body, asked me point blank on Facebook, hey, well my nickname's Booch, hey Booch, when are they gonna do the repairs on Evans Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=812.457s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I said, I'm not sure, I only know what we were told, what you were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=817.423s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then another neighbor of mine in the discussion on Facebook posted the picture of the letter that came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=822.806s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And it was said that last week somebody was going to bring it up for discussion on this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=828.568s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And for whatever reason, probably a good reason, it didn't come up for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=833.271s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I was going to speak last week on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=835.192s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the next day, last Wednesday after work, I came right to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=840.294s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I went into the engineer's office, Cassandra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=842.955s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I asked point blank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=844.416s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Neighbors are asking me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=845.637s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=850.289s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: She told me, and this is no offense, but these are the slow wheels of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=856.451s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Medford has been waiting over six decades, not Medford, but Evans Street, for repairs that really need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=864.453s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We had a water pipe that burst just before Christmas, this past Christmas, on Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=870.868s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But what the engineer told me, who also I know is constrained by a lot of projects that are going on, but what she said was, I'm finalizing the contract now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=880.834s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Then it goes to the purchaser's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=890.36s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I said, well, my neighbors are asking me, when is this work going to be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=894.482s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Possibly July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1051.877s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't want to seem, you know, selfish about Evans Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1056.058s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: coming up here again because I know there's a lot of streets and sub water and gas systems across Medford that need to be looked at, but I'm a little disheartened before this body tonight to come and speak on this matter yet again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1074.143s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Through the administration's office, through the DPW, a letter came out saying that contracts would go out in May,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1084.549s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for the work that needs to be done on Evan Street that members of this body have said in the past is in the top five of worst condition streets in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1096.698s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When that letter came out, it prompted some City Councilors, when they saw it, in good faith, to tell neighbours of mine and myself that work is going to be done this spring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1109.338s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: specifically this May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1111.259s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So a week and a half ago, one of my neighbors, Mr. Rob McGuire, knowing how often I come to the council meetings and discussions I have with the honorable members of this body, asked me point blank on Facebook, hey, well, my nickname's Booch, hey Booch, when are they gonna do the repairs on Evans Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1131.33s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I said, I'm not sure, I only know what we were told, what you were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1136.313s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then another neighbour of mine in the discussion on Facebook posted the picture of the letter that came out, and it was said that last week somebody was going to bring it up for discussion on this body, and for whatever reason, probably a good reason, it didn't come up for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1152.159s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I was going to speak last week on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2556.699s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I forget the detective's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2558.98s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I directly asked him to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2561.797s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: from seeing the way 18 wheelers turn right here out at the point at the, at the citizens bank out at century bank, uh, they physically can't do it even if they had had the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2573.926s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I, I would support, uh, what councilor Knight offered, which is have the state police do it outside the city limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2582.153s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So as not to congest the city, they do it on route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2589.293s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I brought this up at the community police meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2658.095s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's not that they're not willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2659.956s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just that we're a current force of only 104 officers and not having the necessary capacity to do these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2668.16s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They're definitely willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2669.4s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They definitely want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2670.941s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But they looked at it, Councilor, and it's physically not possible for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2678.405s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Of course they want to do it and provide public safety at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2682.346s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I hope I didn't give them this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2719.337s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I posted it around Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2731.856s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: something called ultrafine particles that are hurting respiratory systems of people that are going to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2740.64s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: These low-flying planes, I mean, I know the city council, it's up to our state and our federal delegation to do something, but maybe the city council as a body can look into this article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2751.966s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I can send it to you and see what their findings were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2754.847s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's in communities 10 miles around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2771.571s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, the noise is definitely a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2773.952s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I went to the hospital a couple weeks ago because I had upper respiratory problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2781.373s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I got some medication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2782.814s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There was one person waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2785.178s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: in the urgent care waiting room and two people on either side of me with the same problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2790.62s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Another person had it that I'm currently seeing now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2795.742s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And we should probably look into, you know, medical records going on and determine if these ultrafine particles are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6541.561s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Such as a few weeks ago, Councilor Knight brought up the EpiPens for first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6547.465s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Could we get funding for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6549.286s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Perhaps for police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6552.963s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Oh, specifically just for natural disasters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6561.889s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I know Councilor Breanna Lungo-Koehn has brought up often hiring a full-time grant writer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5459.88s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And while I am thankful that the meeting took place, I'm not really optimistic from what I learned last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5468.992s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They started the meeting out saying that present trends of airplane noise are either going to continue or get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5478.218s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I'm led to believe that it's actually going to get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5482.601s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Now, that's because there's three new airlines that are going to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5489.906s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Some of them are double-deckers that will be coming in over the next, I think you, President Caraviello, said last night, one starts next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5504.282s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They come in with the big A380s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5522.458s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think this slideshow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5526.226s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: was actually the result of a study that I asked the guy after the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5532.511s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think the guy's name from MIT is Professor Hanson or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5538.675s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And it's a taxpayer-funded study that I think more complaints to Massport is good and should happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5549.483s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But what I really think needs to happen is that we have to address our state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5565.574s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I looked up before coming last night, because I thought the airlines were going to be here, the amount of profits that these airlines are reaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5574.441s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I am all for that, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5599.874s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: this excessive noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5627.187s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If we're not going to get a better improvement in quality of life, I really think people should direct their complaints and light the fire under our state delegation and our federal representatives to cause a herring, have people come out and hold these airlines accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5649.244s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5650.264s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Another option they can do, which is cost prohibitive to the airlines, like they did in East Boston and Winthrop, is start soundproofing the windows in Medford, sound panel the houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5661.169s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But because it's Medford, and also Somerville, and Everett, that's cost prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5667.851s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The only real solution, I think, here for them to do is to pay the few extra dollars in fuel costs, fly out over the ocean, gain altitude, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=5678.441s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: you know, not subject our cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5915.639s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Get, get the people with the political will,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5918.474s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and authority to do something about this before we start seeing people leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5923.038s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I want more people to move to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5925.36s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I want it to be the best city north of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5928.863s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But it won't be if we continue with these excessive fees, taxes, and planes that are destroying the quality of life in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9081.801s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A lot of talk was generated on affordable housing and preserving historic landmarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9089.77s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here's a great opportunity to give a little bit more affordable housing to the residents of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9096.21s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And as far as historical landmarks go, how about our senior citizens, like my mother, who's 78 years old, who is a historic person as far as I'm concerned here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9107.099s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This charge, Mr. President, and I'm a little passionate about this, is outrageous, especially when Councilor Marks refers to the fact that there's $8 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9134.077s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And on that point, because this is such an important matter, perhaps that Committee of the Whole meeting should be in this chamber, under the TV, so people at home can watch this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9146.83s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's unfortunate that that meeting is not available to the whole public through technology in some fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9163.421s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In terms of talking about affordability for the residents of Medford, another speaker spoke earlier tonight about how the rents are going way up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9175.109s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Why do you think that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9177.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When the property taxes are always going up, our sales taxes, excise taxes, excess in taxes, a cash account with another $10 million into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9187.45s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: This stuff trickles downhill, Mr. President, in the lower income, in the middle income, and the poor people are the ones who end up paying all of these excessive costs for living in the city of Medford, especially when there's a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10931.45s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10934.752s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be brief at this late hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10937.934s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Last summer, it was proposed that the city move towards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10943.498s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10953.22s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10954.38s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Somehow it came back last Tuesday in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, go green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10965.262s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10972.229s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: by Alicia Hunt, the Director of Energy and Environment here in Medford, the Chairman of the Go Green Medford Community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10980.914s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Basically, for the citizens that are watching at home, it's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11001.413s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Understandably, what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11006.254s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There was also a 30-day opt-out clause in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11011.375s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But Councilor Marks at the Committee of the Whole meeting brought up the state law, which is after 180 days, you cannot opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11020.256s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And getting into these government contracts, doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11029.799s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But the state law says something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11031.76s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm a little bit skeptical of the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11036.282s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If this is really such a good thing, they should present it and market it to the people as an opt-in if they want to, not force everybody all at once to be a part of this system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11048.387s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, that's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11050.168s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Where does it end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11050.968s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is the city council going to vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11054.997s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: another company buys all my clothes for me, all my groceries, it's a dangerous precedent that we're setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11063.281s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11064.262s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I want to be fair to the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11068.364s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo at the Committee of the Whole meeting was very astute in bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11074.888s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I emailed everybody on this council, the Citizens Against Municipal Aggregation website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11081.371s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also included the mayor and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11083.792s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Alicia hunt the director of environment and engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11087.117s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm also going to reach out to them if this ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11093.885s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I just find it just comforting that the city would entertain a notion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11101.482s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: of doing something on behalf of every resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11105.384s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: From reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11110.347s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And if you are locked into it and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day you do try to get out, for some reason you can't, and a lower rate comes, I mean, you can go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11121.053s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The two sources now, it's an Eversource and National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11124.534s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And you can click on them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11126.295s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under those, a ton of other options come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11129.956s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There are choices for citizens to make right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11132.717s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11139.119s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11010.975s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Last summer, it was proposed that the city move towards municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11026.299s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11027.46s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Somehow it came back last Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11029.925s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, Go Green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11038.331s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired by Alicia Hunt, the director of energy and environment here in Medford, the chairman of the Go Green Medford community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11053.981s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Basically, for the citizens that are watching at home,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11057.705s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11074.497s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Understandably, what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11079.316s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There was also a 30 day opt out clause in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11084.439s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But Councilor Marks at the committee of the whole meeting brought up the state law which is after 180 days you cannot opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11093.325s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And getting into these government contracts doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11102.871s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But the state losses something out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11104.832s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm a little bit skeptical of the whole process I if they if this is really such a good thing They should present it and market it to the people as an as an opt-in if they want to not Force everybody all at once to be a part of this system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11121.457s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, that's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11123.217s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Where does it end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11124.037s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is the City Council gonna vote that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11128.066s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: another company buys all my clothes from me, all my groceries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11132.048s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's, it's, it's, it's dangerous precedent that was sent setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11136.329s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11137.33s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I want to be fair to the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11140.791s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Uh, Councilor Dello Russo at the committee of the whole meeting was a very astute and bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11147.954s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I emailed everybody on this council, the citizens against municipal aggregation website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11154.436s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also included the mayor and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11156.861s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Alicia hunt, the director of environment and engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11160.183s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm also going to reach out to them if it ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11166.726s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I just find it just comforting that the city would entertain the notion of doing something on behalf of every resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11178.453s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: from reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11183.416s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And if you are locked into it, and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day, you do try to get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11189.499s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: For some reason, you can't, and a lower rate comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11192.341s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, you can go to the two sources now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11195.202s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's at Eversource and National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11197.603s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And you can click on them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11199.377s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under those, a ton of other options come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11203.02s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There are choices for citizens to make right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11205.802s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11211.686s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11219.491s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11220.712s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
