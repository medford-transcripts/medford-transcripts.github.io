<h2><a href="../2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0/2017-10-20_o7jpBFH8Da0.html">Medford City Council Candidates Forum 10/18/17</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2699.579s">Thank</a> you to the organizers for this event tonight, so that these candidates can come and bring our message to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2707.363s">I'm</a> Robert Capucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2708.363s">I'm</a> 47 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2710.164s">I'm</a> the youngest of seven kids in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2712.825s">I'm</a> a lifelong Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2715.406s">I</a> graduated from Franklin Pierce College in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2718.828s">I</a> went into teaching, and then after a few years of that, I joined the Army Reserves, and I currently work in electronics, making laser scalpels for a company up in Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2729.743s">I</a> heard a lot of the candidates touch upon <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2732.62s">The</a> issues that were sent to us, the city committee here sent us actually 30 different topics to discuss with five minutes to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2742.746s">So</a> I chose five, and I'm going to just answer them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2746.449s">The</a> number one I chose was the opioid crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2750.471s">I</a> lost my best friend in 2003 to drug addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2755.374s">A</a> couple weeks ago, at 46 years old, he had to bury a high school graduate, a classmate of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2761.818s">It's</a> the number one killer of people under 50 years old in America, and it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2769.203s">I</a> think Medford should start leading the way in research and how many prescriptions are actually being given for opioids, to whom, for what purposes, and to investigate to our fullest to ensure every single prescription is right and proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2783.333s">I</a> will continue to support and advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2785.701s">for</a> worthwhile community programs like candlelight vigils, various drug addiction rehab facilities and groups, and other initiatives we have here in Medford such as Team Medford and the new drug officer recently appointed by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2801.669s">I'd</a> also like to establish here in Medford a kind of a tough love approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2806.767s">and</a> send out coordinated, communicated messages to all the residents on a regular basis to get people to realize their problem and light a fire under their butts to get the help that they need so they stop dying and they can enjoy the holidays, child graduations, weddings, all the things that make this life worth living. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2829.675s">The</a> Medford City Council should start leading the way on this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2833.937s">The</a> next topic I want to talk about is inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2837.079s">I</a> think the best way we can be more inclusive of our diversity here in Medford is something that I've been calling for throughout my campaign and for years before. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2851.362s">and</a> it was highlighted just last night in these chambers by the excellent speech of Dr. John Stirella of Metcalf Street in two words, term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2861.877s">If</a> we had a three-term term limit for the elected right now in Medford, there would be five open seats on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2868.846s">for</a> this city to take advantage of and run for. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2872.147s">There</a> would be four seats on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2874.208s">We'd</a> have two new challenging candidates for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2878.349s">Nothing</a> else would lead the way to include the diverse population we have in Medford so that we can hear from all different kinds of people to come up here and act, all different new ideas, new initiatives to include all of Medford in our wonderful city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2894.455s">Parking.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2895.535s">I</a> recently had a conversation with the manager of Carol's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2900.013s">We</a> discussed something that was recently featured on a news program, Chronicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2904.876s">That</a> report was called the Amazon effect, whereby mom-and-pop shops across Medford, across Massachusetts, across the country are getting walloped because more people can easily just go online and order from various, you know, internet services, and they're not being able to keep up with <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2926.423s">these</a> internet companies, the mom and pop shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2928.987s">So</a> what cities and towns are doing to combat this and make our city squares more attractive is <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2935.864s">Offer</a> no-fee parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2938.446s">I</a> lead the way to get us out of the contract with Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2942.048s">We</a> need to revitalize these city squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2944.05s">That's</a> the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2945.471s">If</a> we offer no-fee parking with strict two-hour limits so that we don't have that problem we used to have that's probably still going on on the outskirts of the city, we make sure that people that come here and park and leave their cars all day, after two hours, they're towed at their own expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2964.123s">Taxes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2966.075s">I</a> am actually for the city to collect more taxes and have more taxes in their coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2973.92s">We</a> need these funds for hiring more police, firefighters, teachers, teachers' aides, infrastructure repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2981.425s">What</a> I don't believe in... 20 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2983.686s">Oh,</a> really? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2984.026s">That</a> quick already? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2985.007s">Gee</a> whiz. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2987.82s">Well,</a> what I don't believe in is constantly raising the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2991.282s">What</a> I think is what we do is we create more taxpayers, and the way we do that is to cut taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2996.605s">With</a> my last few seconds, I want to make an appeal to the 28,000 registered voters who don't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3002.789s">Come</a> out and vote on November 7th for Robert Cappucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3005.771s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3006.351s">That</a> was really good.<h2><a href="../2017-10-17_0Vc0VDUwAtI/2017-10-17_0Vc0VDUwAtI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 17, 2017 (Unofficially

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.247s">Testing,</a> 1, 2, 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.727s">Good?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.907s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3384.034s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3386.475s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3387.655s">I'm</a> Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3391.601s">Over</a> the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3398.765s">Me,</a> personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3410.072s">But</a> we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3414.335s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3415.736s">And</a> under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3416.616s">Constitution,</a> there are laws that govern <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3419.642s">how</a> one becomes a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3422.785s">For</a> a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3438.96s">You're</a> subverting the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3441.075s">which</a> for centuries has helped a lot of people come from impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3451.38s">One</a> of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3457.142s">While</a> it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3465.286s">a</a> year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3473.792s">On</a> the state level, among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3480.057s">At</a> the federal level, it's $45 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3483.079s">So</a> the costs coming in don't— <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3487.771s">even</a> come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3500.994s">I</a> don't think that for a city like Medford, for a group like Safe Medford to come along and, you know, this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3514.717s">It's</a> a matter of respect for the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3517.958s">in</a> becoming a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3521.761s">It's</a> an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3539.62s">really</a> the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3546.862s">And</a> under the guise of the feel good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3558.484s">I'll</a> leave you with this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3561.825s">Is</a> Medford being a welcoming city by <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3566.24s">basically</a> subverting the rule of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3568.583s">constitutional</a> law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3579.735s">When</a> a new resident or a new business <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3582.217s">comes</a> to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3591.003s">Here</a> are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3597.987s">Here</a> are the city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3599.088s">Here's</a> when we pick up trash in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3602.17s">That's</a> a welcoming city? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3604.752s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3605.953s">But</a> circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3611.637s">Constitution</a> is? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3612.778s">I</a> beg to differ. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3614.3s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5364.0s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5365.061s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5366.803s">I'll</a> try to be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5369.125s">I</a> don't know anybody from my side of this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5373.746s">who</a> doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5377.009s">I</a> didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5380.753s">In</a> fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5398.792s">It's</a> difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5404.814s">But</a> I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5422.339s">And</a> then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear mongering. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5429.262s">It's</a> just a little hypocritical, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5432.088s">I</a> also want to address the point of <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5434.91s">being</a> for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5445.234s">It</a> has nothing to do with limited government. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5448.315s">It</a> has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5453.917s">We</a> are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5461.04s">In</a> the current policy of not <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5463.564s">ask</a> an immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5465.185s">If</a> that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5470.75s">But</a> make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5477.332s">group</a> is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5490.936s">You</a> know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5496.697s">which</a> Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5511.288s">Massachusetts</a> never signed on to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5513.598s">joined</a> on to the Secured Communities Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5516.722s">And</a> I really don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5518.684s">And</a> whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5530.539s">that</a> govern legal citizenship in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5534.482s">And</a> my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5539.105s">It</a> has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5543.368s">It's</a> just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5551.233s">And</a> those laws have to be respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5553.955s">Are</a> you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5557.967s">to</a> come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5559.128s">And</a> finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever was in power of immigration to know where to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5580.409s">So</a> it's actually <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5582.931s">not</a> a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5588.894s">You're</a> actually putting a target on their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5591.135s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5591.715s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4067.982s">Name</a> and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4070.424s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4071.564s">I'm</a> Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4075.526s">Over</a> the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4082.67s">Me,</a> personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4093.997s">But</a> we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4098.24s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4099.641s">And</a> under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4100.521s">Constitution,</a> there are laws that govern <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4103.553s">how</a> one becomes a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4106.696s">For</a> a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4122.83s">You're</a> subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4129.494s">impoverished</a> or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4135.257s">One</a> of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4141.079s">While</a> it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4157.726s">On</a> the state level, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4159.969s">Among</a> the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4163.972s">At</a> the federal level, it's $45 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4166.995s">So</a> the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4184.93s">I</a> don't think that for a city like Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4189.269s">for</a> a group like Safe Medford to come along. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4192.273s">And</a> this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4198.641s">It's</a> a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4205.28s">It's</a> an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4223.562s">really</a> the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4230.808s">And</a> under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4242.417s">I'll</a> leave you with this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4245.779s">Is</a> Medford being a welcoming city by <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4250.185s">basically</a> subverting the rule of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4252.508s">constitutional</a> law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4263.682s">When</a> a new resident or a new business <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4266.145s">comes</a> to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4274.934s">Here</a> are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4281.921s">Here</a> are the city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4283.043s">Here's</a> when we pick up trash in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4286.106s">That's</a> a welcoming city? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4288.688s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4289.861s">But</a> circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4295.566s">Constitution</a> is? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4297.347s">I</a> beg to differ. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4298.208s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6048.013s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6049.093s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6050.834s">I'll</a> try to be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6053.156s">I</a> don't know anybody from my side of this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6057.776s">who</a> doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6061.039s">I</a> didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6064.783s">In</a> fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6082.819s">It's</a> difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6088.844s">But</a> I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6106.377s">And</a> then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6113.289s">It's</a> just a little hypocritical, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6116.115s">I</a> also want to address the point of <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6118.937s">being</a> for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6129.246s">It</a> has nothing to do with limited government. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6132.328s">It</a> has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6137.933s">We</a> are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6145.038s">In</a> the current policy of not <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6147.521s">ask</a> an immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6149.163s">If</a> that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6154.77s">But</a> make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6161.36s">group</a> is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6174.946s">You</a> know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6180.708s">which</a> Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6195.298s">Massachusetts</a> never <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6197.591s">joined</a> on to the Secured Communities Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6200.692s">And</a> I really don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6202.653s">And</a> whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6214.518s">that</a> govern legal citizenship in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6218.46s">And</a> my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6223.102s">It</a> has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6227.344s">It's</a> just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6235.227s">And</a> those laws have to be respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6237.288s">Are</a> you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6241.963s">to</a> come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6243.104s">And</a> finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6264.374s">So</a> it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6272.88s">You're</a> actually putting a target on their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.122s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a

<a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3400.726s">And</a> when they were told, basically, it's a surrogate on your profile, oh, I'm not voting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.203s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.563s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3406.863s">It</a> was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3411.945s">I</a> don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3415.626s">It</a> was a job well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3417.046s">But</a> it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3429.209s">And</a> Matt, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3431.089s">It</a> was voted on by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3434.123s">What</a> did he say?

<a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1213.349s">Possibly</a> July. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1215.007s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President, but with all due respect, I really don't see it happening this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1220.728s">And</a> now you have to account for there's 26 houses, four on the corner, that's 30 houses, paying at least $1,200 in property taxes, paying God knows what in water taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1233.61s">Even</a> the people that rent there, their rent's going up because of property taxes, the surcharges on property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1239.451s">We're</a> paying a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1242.112s">I</a> did a ballpark figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1244.059s">We're</a> talking over six decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1245.76s">We're</a> talking millions of dollars in taxes from this one street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1249.422s">Uh,</a> I'm here tonight to tell you that I spoke to my fellow residents and, uh, I'm not even here to ask for the work to be done anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1259.787s">Mr.</a> President, uh, a year and a half ago, this administration ran on a promised on her platform that she was going to dust off the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1270.59s">A</a> year and a half later, Mr. President, there's another inch of dust on the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1275.715s">The</a> citizens on Evans street are disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1278.697s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1281.76s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1282.941s">Councilor.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1401.274s">If</a> you drive around the corner on Pinkett Street, the potholes there, you have to navigate around them to not put damage on your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1411.618s">The</a> potholes on Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1413.302s">I</a> mean, there were baseball size rocks coming out of the, out of the gravel, out of the street.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2589.293s">I</a> brought this up at the community police meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2591.794s">They</a> said right out to me, they physically can't do it because of the traffic nightmare that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2596.997s">Those</a> truck pullovers, they take a long, long time to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2603.46s">I'm</a> just giving you the information I got directly from the Method Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2607.742s">And</a> also, too, on the matter, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2610.484s">One</a> of the information, Vice President Fox.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2658.095s">It's</a> not that they're not willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2659.956s">It's</a> just that we're a current force of only 104 officers and not having the necessary capacity to do these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2668.16s">They're</a> definitely willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2669.4s">They</a> definitely want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2670.941s">But</a> they looked at it, Councilor, and it's physically not possible for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2677.424s">They</a> want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2678.405s">Of</a> course they want to do it and provide public safety at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2682.346s">I</a> hope I didn't give them this information.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2702.23s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2704.171s">I</a> would agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2705.471s">Talk</a> directly to the police and I'm sure they're going to confirm exactly what, what I just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2710.773s">On</a> the matter of what Councilor Dello Russo brought up about the low-flying planes and the noise, I read an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2718.376s">Maybe</a> some of you saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2719.337s">I</a> posted it around Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2722.258s">There</a> is a problem in Los Angeles out of LAX. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2725.82s">It's</a> a health problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2728.141s">These</a> low-flying planes are producing <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2731.856s">something</a> called ultrafine particles that are hurting respiratory systems of people that are going to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2740.64s">These</a> low-flying planes, I mean, I know the city council, it's up to our state and our federal delegation to do something, but maybe the city council as a body can look into this article. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2751.966s">I</a> can send it to you and see what their findings were. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2754.847s">It's</a> in communities 10 miles around <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2757.228s">LAX,</a> we're what, seven, eight miles away from Logan, and we are, from that presentation given by Massport a few weeks ago, we are ground zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2768.331s">Medford</a> is directly being assaulted by these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2771.571s">I</a> mean, the noise is definitely a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2773.952s">But</a> I went to the hospital a couple weeks ago because I had upper respiratory problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2781.373s">I</a> got some medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2782.814s">There</a> was one person waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2785.178s">in</a> the urgent care waiting room and two people on either side of me with the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2790.62s">Another</a> person had it that I'm currently seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2795.742s">And</a> we should probably look into, you know, medical records going on and determine if these ultrafine particles are <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2806.862s">invading</a> our airspace and falling on our schools and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2811.926s">The</a> noise could be a small problem compared to something that could be much larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2816.731s">Thank</a> you for your time, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_Buu0dDHgsRo/2017-10-05_Buu0dDHgsRo.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 16, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5044.727s">Well,</a> with regards to dogs, I understand the man's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5049.209s">Maybe</a> the city should just utilize the reverse 311 or 911 it is and just, you know, remind people that when you got your dog out there to have them leashed, maybe periodic checks of proper registration and licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5065.517s">But</a> by the same token, I mean, dogs are more than just pets to a lot of us out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5072.968s">Uh,</a> they're, they're family members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5074.509s">They're,</a> they're beloved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5076.19s">Uh,</a> they provide comfort, joy, protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5079.271s">Uh,</a> I don't want to see the dogs get a bad reputation on this cause I'm, I'm of the opinion that there are no bad dogs, just some bad owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=5089.135s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.

href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7692.109s">Mr.</a> President, I've come down here a couple times now and spoke about Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7697.351s">Reports</a> are that it's been 65 years since it's been repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7702.454s">We</a> know that the gas lines have been redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7706.276s">We're</a> waiting on the water pipes to be redone, and then we can finally get our street paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7714.322s">I</a> hope that this doesn't cost too much because, I mean, we've all lived in Medford for a number of years, running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7721.686s">We've</a> been through every neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7724.127s">I</a> think we know what the problems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7726.708s">I</a> mean, we talked about see, click, fix earlier and, you know, people putting reports on there and having one word resolved and the thing closed and nothing actually being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7738.053s">I've</a> spoken about the huge pothole that still exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7742.138s">right</a> at the end of Evans street at the entrance way that has rocks all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7747.781s">I</a> think we know enough about the infrastructure of the city of Medford from, uh, from roof here to the police station to, uh, Fulton Heights where, I mean, when I ran for a state Senate a couple of years ago, when I went through Fulton Heights, I mean, there were roads up there that should be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7767.473s">They're</a> dilapidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7770.114s">We</a> know the water pipes under the city of Medford, the streets that need to be fixed, and whatever streets that are controlled by the state, we need to reach out to the state to have them fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7782.973s">I</a> don't think we need to incur another cost for the citizens of Medford who are already paying excise taxes, water taxes, property taxes, surcharge now on the property tax coming up, that I hope people are prepared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7797.106s">That</a> first payment in January is going back to the 1st of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7801.31s">That</a> first payment on the CPA is going to be pretty big, and we're not seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7805.389s">anything</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7806.389s">That</a> woman that came up here before talked about her manhole cover out in front of her condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7811.291s">I</a> think we know what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7814.272s">I</a> don't think we need to put any more cost on the city or another layer of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7819.274s">I</a> mean, I appreciate, I definitely appreciate and understand <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7822.39s">Councilor</a> Knight's motives, and I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7825.652s">But</a> I think we already know what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7827.473s">And</a> I just think we need to have an administration that's finally going to light a fire under these problems and get them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7834.197s">Now,</a> the capital improvement project is supposed to start, I believe, next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7838.54s">But</a> then the winter's going to set in, and we're not going to get to these things until the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7844.444s">We've</a> been waiting too long. <a

motives of, of Councilor Knight, but I think we know what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7861.451s">I</a> don't think we need to incur any costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7863.372s">I</a> just think these problems need to be, uh, addressed, taken care of and finally fixed for the, for the citizens who are paying a lot of money in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7873.336s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=7874.577s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Capucci. <a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8193.584s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8194.925s">Just</a> really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8195.706s">Thank</a> you to Councilor Lungo-Koehn for that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8201.03s">Just</a> really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8203.451s">It</a> was actually Mark Twain who said doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8211.073s">But</a> finally, something's being done on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8215.374s">But</a> like I said, it was my neighbor, Mrs. Mottola, who's 86 years old, who's lived on that street since I believe she was in her 30s, who told me that that street hasn't been paved in 65 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8228.216s">I'm</a> not against <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8231.522s">what</a> Councilor Knight is proposing, but I think we already know what the problems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8236.386s">Let's</a> fix them first before we throw more money into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8240.53s">Now,</a> the technology he's talking about is great, but let's fix what we have first and then start monitoring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8247.517s">This</a> technology actually used to work for a company that built these x-ray machines, and they did projects on like the <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8255.928s">the</a> suspension bridge in Boston, where they scanned it and they found the holes in the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8262.852s">I</a> agree with what Councilor Knight has proposed, and I think it would be invaluable to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8268.734s">But</a> I think first, let's, I mean, we're talking about all sorts of people going on see click fix and myself coming to the podium and reporting these problems, and we're not seeing anything done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8280.781s">And</a> now we want to come in and spend more money to get <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8284.085s">information</a> and data that will be valuable that we could work on, but we're not seeing the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8289.766s">Let's</a> get the work done first, fix the streets and roads, and then stop monitoring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8294.447s">That's</a> my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8295.327s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sqp6S0Yyr0A&t=8296.567s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Capucci.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec/2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec.html">Medford, MA City Council - July 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3763.515s">Welcome,</a> please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3766.136s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3767.336s">Uh,</a> Rob Capucci, 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3769.756s">I'll</a> try to be really brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3771.577s">I</a> went to the park department meeting earlier tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3776.678s">And,</a> uh, there's, there's a little bit of conflicting information based on what the park ranger that was there, what, what he said and the citizens that, that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3790.201s">And,</a> uh, I mean, if it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3792.45s">if</a> it's in the purview of this city council, if you have any bearing over the parks department, I don't know if you fund them, if you vote for them on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3801.797s">I</a> would suggest that the rules, that somebody from the parks department that should come here and give their side of the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3810.143s">For</a> instance, the park ranger that was there is saying that there was always two officers at the base of Wright's Pond, and as people left, he allowed people to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3822.559s">But</a> according to the citizen that was here tonight, that is conflicted, and she's reporting something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3830.282s">And</a> if it is what the citizen said, it comes down to that the residents of Medford are paying a fee to use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3840.326s">And</a> apparently, it's sometimes getting denied, even after they're paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3849.565s">With</a> all due respect, that translates to other things in the city of Medford, where our tax dollars and we're not getting the basic fundamental services. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3860.331s">And</a> it's a very serious issue that I just hope that, based on the conflicting reports that are there from an objective outside observer, from having been at the meeting earlier and hearing what my fellow citizens said, <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3879.859s">It's</a> an important issue to look into further, and that's my humble suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=3884.042s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10620.736s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10621.717s">Bob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10625.179s">My</a> question in all of this is on discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10628.32s">I</a> mean, the laws are in place, and we are a city, a state, and a nation of laws that we must follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10636.104s">But</a> I'm worried about, you know, just applying these laws no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10643.288s">I</a> mean, are we going to hire people now that the animal control officer is here? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10647.926s">I</a> mean, when do they apply the law of dogs being off the leash? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10654.488s">I</a> asked this for a specific instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10656.609s">A</a> few weeks ago, actually earlier in the spring, a woman, a senior citizen who walks her dog in the park near my house, Morrison, the dog's name is Noodle. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10667.953s">It's</a> about a foot and a half long, six inches high. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10671.814s">She</a> left the dog off the leash and she got hit with a $200 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10676.073s">And</a> she asked the officer, you know, don't you give a warning first? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10680.456s">And</a> he said, yeah, this is the warning, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10682.837s">And</a> it was a $200 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10684.919s">I</a> mean, we should definitely respect and follow the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10688.941s">But</a> I also think that there are times when, you know, I mean, we hire police and teachers and we elect city councilors to also be, you know, of good judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10701.162s">And</a> I think that was a bad judgment call to give this woman a $200 ticket for noodle that you wouldn't even feel if it was sitting on your foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10710.208s">You</a> know, I think looking at this and talking about offense and everything else, you know, we should just, like the last gentleman spoke about, about discretion and improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10720.034s">I</a> mean, I think terms of judgment calls is one of the areas we should also look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10724.837s">I</a> mean, people know their dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10726.378s">They</a> know their city. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10727.518s">They</a> know when the dog should be off the leash and when not. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10730.377s">And</a> every dog owner I've seen across Medford always picks up after their dog and looks out when other dogs are present. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10738.702s">But</a> those are my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10739.822s">And</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=10742.524s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

of 71 Evans street, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4644.111s">if</a> I could just submit this petition that I collected from my fellow neighbors on Evans Street and on the corners of the street as well, Central and Lawrence Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4658.837s">Basically,</a> we, the undersigned residents and abutters to Evans Street, demand our water pipes fixed and street repaved as promised by the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4668.801s">I</a> got 50 signatures from fellow residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4672.843s">The</a> reason <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4673.94s">You</a> folks might have received some emails today from Pinkett Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4677.122s">It's</a> because, you know, with time constraints, I couldn't go down that street and get their signatures as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4684.148s">But</a> I did go down that street and I put out a flyer with everybody's email and the mayor's as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4690.213s">If</a> I could submit that to the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4692.615s">Please</a> submit that to the messenger who will submit it to the city clerk and make it part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4698.279s">Okay,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4699.92s">No,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4700.621s">But,</a> you know, a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4704.217s">A</a> fellow neighbor of mine, Shauna Smith and I came up, and we discussed this street, and it was, what's the word? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4715.38s">It</a> was mutually agreed that Evans Street, I mean, I don't wanna rehash everything that was already said here tonight, but Evans Street is in one of the top five of direly needed repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4727.61s">Council</a> Vice President Lungo-Koehn is exactly right, that this street, I mean, let's put that into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4734.991s">65</a> years it's been since this street has been repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4740.572s">You</a> know, with the water pipes underneath them, who knows if we're drinking lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4744.313s">It's</a> way past time, Mr. President, which, you know, we were told that bids would go out, they would be decided on in the best possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4754.315s">At</a> this point now, my understanding is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4756.735s">None</a> of these bids were decided on, which brought to me to go out, you know, after being told one thing, to go out and get these signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4763.939s">In</a> relation to other things like, which I'm 100% for, park improvement and bringing things in there, we need to fix what we, I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4775.466s">I</a> think maybe a tandem project could be done to do it, but, you know, if you go out and you fix the parks, it, quite frankly, it's putting lipstick on a pig, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4787.172s">It's</a> more than just the infrastructure work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4793.663s">I</a> took my first steps of my life on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4796.888s">We</a> have residents on that street right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4799.358s">diagnosed</a> with cancer who will be dead, at least one, within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4803.982s">We</a> need people taking our first and our last steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4807.304s">This</a> is our home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4809.766s">Our</a> excise taxes, our sales taxes, our property taxes, our surcharges on these taxes go towards keeping our home, our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4819.673s">We</a> come home after a hard day of work to see potholes as big as the mouths of an alligator with rocks all over the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4827.179s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4828.881s">You</a> wonder why that sometimes, you know, people... <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4834.019s">I</a> don't want to say it's a direct correlation, but it doesn't help when there's an opioid and a drinking problem to come home after a hard day's work and see our existence in total shambles, with streets falling apart and sidewalks falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4850.224s">It</a> doesn't help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4850.784s">These</a> things are related. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4852.384s">Not</a> a direct cause and effect, but it is related. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4858.286s">It's</a> more than just the infrastructure projects that are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4862.547s">And</a> when we pay all this to actually see government governing over the will of the people, we can't wrap our minds around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4870.652s">You</a> should have heard some of the comments I heard coming down the street, my neighbor across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4875.822s">Her</a> SUV two years ago sank in the sewer draining because the street around it fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4883.647s">And</a> she had to call AAA to get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4885.808s">Mrs.</a> Natola told me a bunch of years back, a whole chasm opened up on Evans Street, and a whole truck fell into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4893.732s">And</a> that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4894.593s">It's</a> wear and tear on our police vehicles, and our fire engines, and other infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4902.377s">plowing</a> trucks and everything else that we're also paying for as taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4908.101s">I</a> mean, it's at a critical point, and I want to thank this council for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4914.464s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Reed and Mr. Penter, who spoke before, and I hope that something can be done expediently, because we're tired of paying to be told something and then not having it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4929.889s">It's</a> beyond comprehension. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4931.61s">It's</a> beyond incompetence. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4933.65s">And</a> it's an affront to people that have lived on these city streets in their whole lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4944.134s">I</a> mean, with kids playing there, with their pets and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4946.855s">Mr.</a> President, please use the power of this body to <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4952.125s">inspire</a> this mayor to do what we all know has to be done, or do something when the budget comes up, to jar the system and make it work for the people that you represent, who voted for you, who put you on this august body, as Mr. Penta likes to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4970.237s">I</a> think another member of the community wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4974.878s">And</a> I hope that, you know, I get a little passionate, but I'm not speaking up here just for myself, speaking on these for these other 50 people and all around the city of Medford to people who who don't have the time to come out to this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4989.662s">I'm</a> fortunate to have the

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6813.174s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6814.614s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6818.008s">I</a> want to thank all the people that came out and spoke tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6821.609s">I</a> would hope that, you know, with this audience and focus on this issue, I would hope that more residents in the auditorium tonight and watching at home would pay a lot more attention to what goes on in the city of Medford on their website, because this is one in a sea of issues that escapes a lot of people in their everyday lives, that if more people came out and spoke like this so eloquently, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6847.871s">as</a> have tonight that came before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6851.232s">A</a> lot more good government and a lot more good stewardship of the people's money would take place in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6857.993s">I</a> just want to address three quick points. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6860.394s">Communication,</a> affordable housing, and money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6865.015s">On</a> communication, obviously, this Zoning Board of Appeals seriously dropped the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6870.756s">I</a> mean, if they took into account the full city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6874.142s">in</a> the streets and roads, the police department falling apart, the school facade, this building right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6880.126s">There</a> are a lot more serious issues to address first before we bring in a 490 unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6886.43s">I</a> mean, my street alone, I just found out tonight that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6891.928s">I</a> came up before this council a few weeks ago that Evans Street is one of the top five streets, and Evans Street is a stone's throw from this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6901.17s">Now,</a> with this traffic that's gonna develop, you're gonna see more people trying to avoid the long lines and going down some of these other side streets like mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6910.132s">Now,</a> the Honorable Adam Knight sent me a message that bidding on my street ended, and they were gonna choose, but I come to find out, the meeting on Saturday morning, that nothing's moving forward on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6920.714s">There's</a> no plans to do any construction or fixing of that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6924.582s">The</a> water pipes in Medford, the gas pipes, there's a lot more serious issues to look at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6930.046s">before</a> the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6932.628s">And</a> I think Sheryl Rodriguez was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6934.729s">It</a> wasn't written by Medford for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6937.151s">It</a> was written by this body that wants to come in and make some change. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6941.374s">That's</a> first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6943.335s">Communication</a> is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6945.236s">It's</a> just that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6946.677s">The</a> second point is affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6949.099s">There's</a> other ways of making things affordable for the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6954.923s">Meals</a> tax, sales tax, income tax, property tax, that goes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6959.366s">Next</a> month starts the Community Preservation Act, which is an end-run to around the property two and a half tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6965.269s">That's</a> a surcharge on the property taxes that have gone up for every year for nearly 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6970.331s">Reduce</a> some of these taxes, make it more affordable for the citizens of Medford, people to want to move here, businesses to want to move here through tax incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6980.535s">With</a> more people moving in, you'll find that the city will actually have reduced tax rates, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6984.757s">would</a> probably take in more revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6986.917s">That's</a> number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6988.618s">Number</a> three is money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6990.158s">You're</a> talking about hiring a lawyer if this resolution is passed and the cost that's going to be on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6998.36s">What</a> cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6999.0s">You're</a> having a free cash account, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7001.3s">A</a> surplus of almost $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7003.561s">How</a> many millions in surplus is this city sitting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7007.142s">This</a> is our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7008.122s">We've</a> already paid for the lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7010.802s">Their</a> money has already been given to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7013.323s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7016.463s">And</a> finally, one last question through the chair for the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7019.904s">If</a> this board does vote to pass a resolution to appeal, then the mayor has to approve it or is she automatically bound by the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7032.406s">The</a> president is shaking his head no. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7035.607s">So</a> what you're saying is this city council could pass a resolution and the mayor could possibly shoot it down and the appeal is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7043.092s">Is</a> that what you're telling me, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7046.553s">I</a> wouldn't use those words, but yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7051.795s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7052.595s">I'm</a> sure you would use much more congenial words, and I appreciate your candor and good judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7058.697s">I</a> hope that if that does become the situation, and it does get dismissed, not approved, kindly disregarded by Her Honor the Mayor, then when you come to a city budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7073.213s">You</a> should actually use the power of the city council to have some bite, to speak up for these people that are in this audience tonight that want action for their money and their votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7082.991s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11073.433s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11074.513s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11076.554s">I'll</a> try to be very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11078.995s">It</a> seems to me like there's some confusion as to whether or not, I mean, you're talking about the process and I appreciate that, but I mean, everything that was discussed tonight, you've got the 11 variances, the zoning particular to this case impact on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11095.481s">It</a> seems to me you've got, like right now, you could make a motion to appeal, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11102.482s">enlist</a> specific things, specific to this zoning law, as the city solicitor informed us that it has to be specific to this zoning, to take a vote on appeal and request the funds from the mayor for the legal representation for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11119.705s">I</a> don't see why that's not crystal clear to everybody in this room at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11126.626s">And</a> I would just like to ask, when you do take the vote to appeal and it gets approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11131.833s">that</a> whatever meetings that you do have with legal representation, that it's open to the public, specifically to the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11140.376s">Because</a> like Gene Martin said earlier, these are people that, you know, this is everyday, ordinary people that may not be lawyers, that may not be pretty about how to go about appealing this as a direct abutter to this, so that they could come, not to piggyback on your litigation process, but so that they can absorb information as well <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11161.152s">so</a> that they know what to do going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11163.473s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks/2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 7, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5185.165s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5186.325s">I'm</a> Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street, which is not a direct abutter, but very close proximity to this massive project that's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5196.429s">And,</a> you know, there's not too much more to add to the conversation except to touch upon the infrastructure problems that the city already has. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5208.673s">I</a> mean, here in this building, the high school, the police department, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5215.178s">I</a> was up here last week talking about Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5220.62s">We're</a> not against the development, but something this big, I definitely agree with Councilors Knight and Falco, that this is just something that seems to be too big, and it seems to be coming in with the impression I'm getting, with a lot of expediency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5234.847s">I</a> mean, actually being told, the citizens, by this developer, it's coming, deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5240.229s">That's</a> unprecedented. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5241.67s">I</a> want to thank all the other speakers that spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5244.993s">When</a> this traffic impact happens, you know, and it gets clogged on Fellsway and Riverside Ave, these folks are going to be looking for, you know, quick shortcuts to get back to their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5257.342s">They're</a> going to be going down Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5259.043s">That's</a> not fixed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5260.664s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for informing me that the bids are in to replace the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5266.368s">And</a> once those bids seep through and one is decided on, they're going to come in and fix Evans Street, which is in the top five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5274.409s">of</a> streets that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5276.25s">But</a> there's probably a hundred or more streets that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5280.132s">And</a> what happens when this added traffic is on the roads when Evans Street is shut down for, who knows, a month for fixing? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5288.897s">And</a> other streets are too. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5291.319s">It</a> seems to me that we don't want to discourage development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5297.822s">But</a> at the same time, we got to fix what we got first. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5300.624s">We</a> can't build on a faulty foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5303.426s">Our</a> streets and roads, our water pipes, the parks are being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5308.01s">I</a> mean, this location seems to me a good location to put a joint police and fire station instead of this massive project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5318.538s">It</a> just seems to me that there are other things to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5321.17s">in</a> this city first that need almost at a critical level of attention before we start entertaining massive, massive projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5331.758s">I</a> mean, there's a public safety issue too with all these cars going down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5335.38s">I</a> mean, in my neighborhood, there's at least 20 young kids that live on that street that are all over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5342.125s">If</a> they can navigate through all the rocks on Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5346.238s">Sorry</a> for the jab on that one again, but still, I mean, in all of these neighborhoods with more cards on there, the safety risk goes up, and if it goes up even 1%, that's, I'm sorry, that's too much for my liking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5361.384s">I</a> really don't understand how this city council doesn't have jurisdiction over the appeal or whoever's approving this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5371.467s">It</a> would seem that you must have something in the books <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5374.465s">put</a> some kind of injunction. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5376.186s">And</a> that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5378.007s">Why</a> doesn't this body communicate with the DPW or with the police station or with other things to find out, you know, there's a lot of infrastructure problems in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5387.974s">You</a> know, let's talk about this impact on the city and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5393.938s">Why</a> don't we get together and maybe not <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5396.517s">approve</a> this, especially in the manner with which they're keeping people in a dark room on a hot night and giving them three minutes to speak, and then they're being told. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5406.365s">One</a> of the speakers that spoke earlier that called everybody to a public action, I can't emphasize and ditto her and echo her more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5416.012s">That's</a> what we need, not for just this issue, but I would love to see more people at this podium and in these chambers every week <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5425.248s">because</a> when more voices are heard from all different parts of this city, more projects will have a fire lit under them, and more things will get done for the benefit of all of us, everybody on the city council, the administration, all the small businesses, and all the taxpayers, and all the residents, the kids in the schools, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5447.74s">Politics</a> is really not a spectator sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5450.241s">But</a> I hope you consider all the things everybody said tonight, and I thank you for your time.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10376.024s">Thank</a> you, President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10377.904s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10382.492s">I</a> have to say really briefly, I really enjoy saying President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10387.816s">That</a> would be a great thing for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10390.838s">But</a> I digress. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10392.419s">Is</a> this matter going to be tabled? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10398.503s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10399.304s">I</a> believe we're going to have that offering, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10401.525s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10402.426s">I</a> mean, all through this discussion, a couple of things came to my mind that Ronald Reagan often said. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10412.31s">as</a> scary as nine words, I'm here from the government and I'm here to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10416.293s">And</a> the government that governs least is the government that governs best. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10420.937s">President</a> Lungo-Koehn, what Councilor Marks said tonight was 1,000% spot on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10429.083s">I</a> think the vote should be taken and this should be voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10435.988s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10439.41s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10439.651s">Hunt</a> said to <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10442.088s">Councilor</a> Caraviello that she wouldn't want to have a public hearing on a theoretical proposition, but they want to have the vote tonight on a solid proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10456.316s">So</a> I don't understand how it changes from a solid proposal to the city council to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10462.878s">to</a> a theoretical proposition to the citizens that are suffering, do as I say, not as I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10469.923s">I'm</a> really confused on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10472.405s">How</a> is that possible, that for the residents, it's a theoretical proposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10478.108s">But</a> there's an ironclad proposal here tonight that's going to bind the residents of Medford Inn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10484.713s">That's</a> why I asked President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10488.049s">this</a> was going to be tabled, because if it's going to be tabled, then my point is moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10494.634s">But</a> I really think this should be voted down, unless the city's going to get in on it, too, like Councilor Marks said. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10506.463s">But</a> I think the residents of this city need to have 1,000 questions, all sorts of input. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10518.288s">since,</a> you know, they're being basically forced into something. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10524.209s">Thank</a> you, President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA/2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 31, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=792.766s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=793.626s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=795.426s">Robert</a> Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=798.248s">So,</a> I mean, just a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=800.329s">When</a> you say that Lauren did her job, there have been, going back a couple years now, reports to the city about this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=813.174s">It</a> spills out into Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=816.035s">These</a> rocks are in front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=818.796s">They're</a> on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=822.898s">My</a> question, I guess, is will we get a time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=828.173s">of</a> when this will be done, because it is the summertime now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=832.275s">Kids</a> are out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=833.516s">They're</a> going to be all over that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=835.417s">It's</a> only a matter of time before a tire spins one of these up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=839.379s">I</a> mean, we've already had injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=842.16s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, is there any way we can get some type of time frame on when to expect this street to be fixed?
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=867.601s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=879.269s">When</a> we consider the surplus amounts in city coffers and you know, we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=884.857s">an</a> endless list of taxes to be paid, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=888.3s">And</a> no disrespect to this body, but this is—it's an abomination. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=895.726s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=896.466s">And</a> the amount of money that we pay as residents and taxpayers, that this wasn't done two years ago when you were first informed of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=906.274s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1103.73s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1105.191s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1107.732s">Maybe</a> if they could come by and pick up all these loose rocks that are, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1113.175s">But</a> if this gets added to the mayor's capital plan, what does that do in terms of a timeframe of fixing this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1120.578s">I</a> mean, when do they meet on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1121.959s">When</a> is that discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1123.32s">When</a> is that approved?
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1178.593s">So</a> then my next question would be, knowing this, why would a councillor request to put this on the capital plan that's going to push it out another year or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1188.458s">It's</a> unprecedented.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4189.003s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4190.304s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4194.047s">Just</a> to address some of the things that were talked about here, I don't think Mr. Reid was coming up here to try to be accusatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4201.813s">I</a> just think he was asking for accountability and transparency on issues that have been going on in the city of Medford for years, if not decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4212.281s">When</a> I ran for this body in 2013, my main issue was the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4217.923s">You're</a> asking the citizens of Medford to pay for the rainwater in the snow melt. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4223.107s">You</a> add that to the meals tax, the sales tax, the property tax, which is about to have a surcharge put on it, and we want answers as to why things are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4232.895s">The</a> Honorable Mike Marks asks, well, where do you think that the lack of communication came? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4238.96s">Well,</a> you heard my neighbor and friend earlier tonight say four recent <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4245.878s">additions</a> to C-Click Fix were taken down today as resolved, and obviously they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4251.819s">Those</a> pictures I took were yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4253.78s">This</a> gentleman is talking about a state allocation of $4 million that we could be using on top of what is in the excess of the water account now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4263.942s">It's</a> like $7 million or something like that was the last report I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4268.523s">Now</a> we're talking about $10 or $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4272.453s">It</a> doesn't need to be discussed or pushed forward anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4276.255s">It's</a> not just Devon Street, it's also Pinkard Street around the corner from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4281.878s">In</a> working on several campaigns that I've worked on and ballot initiatives, walking around the city through the Heights, through South Medford, it's literally the whole city, with some streets being at an emergency condition, with matters of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4299.253s">we're</a> asking questions about all the tax dollars that we pay and the fees that we pay, the parking meters, people paying after six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4307.68s">I</a> mean, where is all this money going? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4311.183s">I</a> think it's not being done because it looks great sitting in the accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4316.267s">And</a> then Medford elected public servants can go around and say, well, Moody's just upgraded our credit rating to AAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4326.476s">And</a> yeah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4329.08s">on</a> paper, but when you look through and walk through the city and you're wondering why communications are going ignored from people who work for the city, and you ask a question, it's like, where's the problems and where's the miscommunications? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.047s">It's</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.908s">And</a> we're just asking for the work to be done that has been years in dire need of it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4353.913s">You</a> got the budget next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4355.734s">I</a> hope a lot of people will come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4358.39s">and</a> ask questions and hold you folks accountable and transparent to the citizens that are paying for all of this, that are not getting anything back when Dr. Stirello talked about the police department deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4374.685s">I</a> hope people will come tomorrow night to the town hall that the chief will have at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4382.388s">and</a> ask questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4383.768s">But</a> I know you sigh, and I'm talking, and I'm taking too much time, President Dello Russo, but these are very important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4391.69s">It's</a> a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4392.91s">It's</a> a matter of work not getting done with all of the money sitting there when petitions are being ignored for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4400.931s">I'm</a> sorry, but it's really at the brink, and this body really needs to come together and do something to light a fire under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4409.533s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4995.918s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4997.238s">Rob</a> Capucci again, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4999.719s">There's</a> another issue going on at Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5001.96s">I'm</a> not sure or not if it's supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5004.661s">I</a> believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5005.885s">But</a> these machines are supposed to shut down at 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5008.847s">They're</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5010.468s">In</a> the last month and a half, just walking through the city, I told a good dozen people, just tonight, I went to the store before coming here, and at 6.40, there was a young lady starting to feed money into the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5022.657s">And</a> I said, no, you don't have to pay right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5025.039s">It's</a> 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5026.24s">And</a> she said, well, I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5028.121s">And</a> I said, well, it's on the parking sign, but it's written very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5031.744s">She</a> said, well, it would have been a little bit more helpful if it was actually on the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5035.428s">itself,</a> that it closes at 6 o'clock.

<a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9325.5s">We</a> get that one little piece of paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9327.701s">It's</a> embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9331.375s">Mr.</a> President, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9333.856s">I</a> would like this body, I request this body to please write up a letter and send it to their committee and express not just your feelings, but as the voice of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9346.059s">I</a> tried to get the signatures with Dr. Stirella about four or five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9350.84s">Another</a> team came in after that under former mayor candidate Antony D'Antonio. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9357.442s">There's</a> another team out there <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9360.39s">In</a> all of that time, we got a lot of positive feedback, but it's hard to get these signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9366.672s">I</a> was on the team that got the signatures for the tank, the gas tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9371.773s">We</a> had a team of about 500 people across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9374.914s">It</a> took a lot of time and a lot of effort, and we squeaked it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9379.295s">And</a> what's the state legislature doing now in the face of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9382.976s">They're</a> trying to pass a new law saying the cities can raise the gas tax if they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9389.553s">step</a> forward, you go three steps back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9393.474s">Please,</a> send a letter to this committee and let them know that we're in charge of the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9402.315s">They're</a> not in charge of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=9404.055s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_jCO6jvvXtn0/2025-03-21_jCO6jvvXtn0.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 3, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1605.86s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1607.021s">I'm</a> Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1610.528s">Uh,</a> my, my first question on this matter is has, has the city council of Medford, uh, decided to, uh, become a, uh, a union talking point. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1623.697s">Now</a> I don't really take either side on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1626.719s">My</a> question is the function of the city council to represent all of the citizens, citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1633.264s">I</a> mean, if you're going to start taking up every single union issue that <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1638.099s">It</a> reflects badly on this body, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1642.281s">Why</a> not take up the issue of the local 25 here, where the new mayoral administration has pretty much nearly wiped out their overtime? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1654.185s">But</a> that's another matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1656.286s">Councilor</a> Knight has brought up some very good points, but he doesn't just cite Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1664.529s">He</a> cites all of corporate <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1667.253s">corporate</a> America. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1668.534s">Now,</a> the unions in this case are actually representing the work line, not the entire workforce, as Councilor Knight alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1680.02s">It's</a> the work line force of Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1683.382s">Since</a> the year 2000, their responsibility, their Department of Verizon, in terms of their overall economic intake, in 2000 it was 60% <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1698.383s">Today,</a> in 2016, it's actually less than 7%. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1702.187s">What</a> Verizon is doing is actually, in my research, and I got this all from the public record that anybody can look up, what Verizon is doing is conforming to the 21st century and the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1717.4s">What</a> is before this union and the company is a contract, and that's up to them to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=1725.745s">If</a> the councilor wanted to, you know, make a statement on it, but to actually call for this city to take action, I think sets a precedent.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=2136.956s">Well,</a> with the fact that this particular department has declined over 53 percent, what Verizon has done is expanded in fiber for broadband services. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=2152.4s">They</a> invested in workers and tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=2154.903s">to</a> keep a lot of these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=2156.544s">What</a> we're talking about here, actually, is a private case that the council has brought forth that the city of Medford is now going to clamp down on corporate evil greed America. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=2170.268s">And</a> that's what's really fueling all of this, Mr. President.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3723.966s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3725.187s">I'm</a> Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3729.548s">Let</a> me start with the city is being denied a service that we're paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3735.673s">The</a> last figure I heard is somewhere around half a million dollars from our Verizon and cable bill is going towards public access that's been shut off since, I believe, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3748.36s">That's</a> years of a disservice to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3753.463s">So</a> on Friday, I actually took a day off from work and I drove around to Melrose Community Public Access Station, SCAT TV in Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3764.25s">and</a> Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3766.752s">Just</a> to give an idea of what we're being denied here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3770.554s">First</a> of all, jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3772.575s">Somerville</a> employs eight people full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3775.877s">Malden,</a> I found out from one of the station managers that I visited, employs nine people full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3782.521s">Melrose</a> has three people full-time with three part-timers, and I think it's the same in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3788.104s">That's</a> jobs being denied to Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3791.286s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3793.237s">The</a> programming that's on some of these stations is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3799.54s">Self-help</a> programs, community awareness programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3804.541s">I</a> think of some of the organizations here in Medford, like the Medford Community Coalition or Prominent Citizens that were just honored a few weeks ago, Jay Campbell, the fine things these folks do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3817.906s">With</a> a public access TV show, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3820.63s">it</a> could be compounded and bring more great services to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3825.813s">I</a> mean, you all know I'm a political activist, so my forte is, you know, we're in a big election year here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3832.215s">Candidates,</a> next year's a municipal election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3835.537s">Candidates</a> could have a forum, another avenue to bring their campaign and talk about different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3843.42s">You</a> know, I think about in 2015, some 2,500 people blanked <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3849.393s">the</a> ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3851.816s">It</a> might not have been so many if we had, you know, a public access TV show where we could discuss the pros and cons of the ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3863.369s">Other</a> things, too, that could happen, the Honorable Breanna Lungo-Koehn talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3870.825s">communications</a> from the police in terms of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3875.607s">He</a> could have a show on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3877.548s">You</a> can talk about different neighborhoods in Medford that might be having problems or might need more attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3886.253s">Boards</a> and planning meetings that happen in this building could find a show from somebody who wishes to produce a show on things like that and bring more information <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3898.672s">which</a> is power and knowledge to the taxpayers of this city that deserve public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3906.156s">Now,</a> in talking with other station managers and the wonderful things that they're doing, at least one of them, the station manager at Somerville, knew a little bit about what we have here in Medford, the equipment, and they offered, you know, they said if I'm successful in bringing a positive message and do get the ball rolling, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3927.316s">They're</a> going to reach out, and they're going to help us get us up on our feet and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3931.198s">I'm</a> sure there's a lot of other residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3934.04s">The</a> students, they have great teaching going on at Medford High School, but having our own public access, this could be almost like an internship for them to get real world experience to move on to whatever college and future careers they might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3952.049s">In</a> closing, I just want to say that I <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3956.063s">I</a> hope that the mayor's office is watching this because I believe ultimately it resides in the mayor's office to get this back up and running or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3964.469s">But</a> if there's any kind of vote or any influence that you find city councilors can have on the mayor's office to get this going, it would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3974.737s">I</a> mean, in terms of helping this city, there's so many things a public access station can do for children, for working families, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3985.865s">and</a> for our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3987.525s">So</a> I hope you take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3989.626s">Thank</a> you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3990.666s">Thank</a> you very much.

href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6266.436s">I</a> want to thank Councilors Lungo-Koehn, and Marks for bringing up these topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6270.959s">I'm</a> of the humble opinion that government's first duty is protection of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6276.984s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, I think hit it right on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6280.783s">I</a> do attend the first Wednesday of the month police chief town hall meetings where there are sergeants and detectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6289.611s">It's</a> every first Wednesday of the month at 7 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6294.095s">We</a> need to fully staff our police force and we need to get them a better station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6300.841s">On</a> March 18th, four officers will be graduating from the academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6306.022s">given</a> us a total of 105 offices in Medford, putting us about 25 offices short for a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6314.066s">Now,</a> these informational meetings, I would encourage people to go that might be watching and listening to me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6323.57s">They</a> have refreshments there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6325.01s">You</a> can ask any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6327.151s">The</a> things you find out are very pertinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6334.048s">Like</a> what I found out at the last meeting was, with just an additional 10 officers, they could be able to be doing so much more for the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6343.994s">They</a> just got a Twitter account. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6346.076s">I'm</a> pretty sure it's at medfordpolice.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6348.73s">But</a> I would either Bing or Google search that to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6352.893s">But</a> one of the reactions of having this Twitter account now is that the media will be asking them questions about different things that they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6364.621s">And</a> this takes a lot of time away from the officers to be able to do their duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6372.847s">They're</a> making about one arrest a week on drug charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6377.566s">There's</a> somebody else going around the city now targeting Hondas, stealing the tire right off the car using a silent drill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6386.191s">There's</a> a lot going on, and there's a lot that can be learned at this informational meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6391.154s">But</a> as Councilor Riccabiello pointed out, they need the offices to be able to have good communication with the people, to be able to be in every <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6400.603s">neighborhood</a> of our city to be enforcing the law and having a much stronger and sounder public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6408.353s">But</a> they need the officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6410.076s">Just</a> 10 more officers would do a world of good for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6413.46s">And</a> as far as communication goes, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6417.188s">This</a> city is sitting on almost a half a million dollars in collected fees from the Verizon and Comcast accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6423.71s">It's</a> long past due that we open up our TV3 station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6427.952s">We</a> could be talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6429.332s">We</a> could be talking about the charter review and explaining it to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6432.393s">As</a> Councilor Knight points out, people don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6434.514s">Well,</a> let's really open up the doors of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6437.215s">The</a> chief could have his own show on TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6441.116s">We</a> could be doing a lot more for communication in this city and a lot more for public <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6446.178s">safety.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6447.219s">You're</a> sitting on the funds to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6449.921s">I</a> would respectfully ask you to please get the ball rolling in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6454.845s">And</a> I thank you again for bringing this up, and I thank the councillors for their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6460.689s">And</a> again, Councilor Caraviello hit it right on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=6463.572s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5323.49s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5324.691s">I'm</a> Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5328.419s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilman Marks, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5332.601s">Always</a> at your best and doing your due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5335.483s">Love</a> to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5336.623s">As</a> you know, Dr. Starella and I tried to get the signatures for this about four or five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5343.207s">And</a> then another group led by a former mayor candidate, Anthony D'Antonio, tried as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5350.11s">And</a> now I'm glad to see that there's a third group trying to get this underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5355.393s">To</a> be clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5357.67s">recent</a> municipal election, why I think the mayor is on board with this, and I want to thank her too, is she won a very narrow election, and half of the city voted for Barpenta, who made it, I think, a forefront of his campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5374.359s">And</a> with all due respect, I think that's why we're talking about it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5378.301s">I</a> just had to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5380.762s">I'm</a> a little squeamish about this Collins, is that what it's called? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5386.72s">call-in</a> centre coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5389.041s">While</a> I think we should definitely entertain any positive suggestions, this is for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5396.162s">It</a> should be driven by Medford residents, as former Councilor Camuso had once said when this was in discussion before when he was a member of this body, and I wholeheartedly agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5408.666s">Without</a> getting into <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5410.273s">any</a> kind of quirky jokes or real bad municipal law technicalities, just a plain spoken guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5419.821s">So</a> I'm going to speak as plain as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5422.783s">This</a> city has all of its power centered in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5427.487s">The</a> city council's ultimate power basically is to cut the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5433.372s">After</a> 30 years, that has to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5436.414s">As</a> a former candidate <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5437.938s">for</a> City Council, I struggled to run citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5442.28s">Some</a> candidates have the support of special interest groups, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5446.122s">They're</a> able to raise tens of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5449.704s">I</a> spent $94.50 in my campaign in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5455.007s">I</a> didn't ask for any money because I knew the special interest groups wouldn't support the kind of initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5460.71s">This</a> is it, folks, people watching, people listening tonight, this is the way to get <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5466.183s">City</a> government change. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5467.104s">It's</a> been 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5469.326s">Councilor</a> Marks brought up some real good things that this can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5474.791s">I</a> mean, we're a city with a police station that's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5478.334s">The</a> force is understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5480.276s">The</a> school is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5482.137s">The</a> streets and roads are falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5486.301s">One</a> of the speakers spoke tonight about the soul of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5491.098s">being</a> the government, government affects the souls of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5496.159s">And</a> people that are watching should start calling in and emailing now your state representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5503.321s">This</a> should be on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5505.822s">No</a> question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5507.102s">Long</a> overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5508.362s">Serious</a> changes have to be made in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5511.283s">We've</a> got people coming in here fighting government to keep a historical house in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5521.543s">It</a> shouldn't be like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5524.805s">The</a> bulk of this people want something in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5527.687s">They</a> should get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5528.727s">They</a> shouldn't have to worry about their kids at school with open doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5532.93s">And</a> I know this is coming up in future resolutions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5537.192s">But</a> this is the way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5539.193s">We</a> take a good, hard look. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5542.778s">at</a> the condition the city's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5544.579s">We</a> take a good hard look at why it's in that condition and what can be done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5549.662s">Changing</a> this city charter is paramount after 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5553.824s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5565.871s">I'm</a> not, I'm not squeamish about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5568.273s">Maybe</a> that was a poor choice of words. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5570.114s">Like</a> I said, I definitely would, would welcome.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5581.763s">But</a> at the end of the day, the city gets all its power and all its money from the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5589.507s">Whatever</a> this group comes in and suggests, if it's positive and helpful, yeah, I'd be all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5595.711s">But</a> at the end of the day, it should be decided by vote by the citizens of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5606.278s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5606.538s">Well,</a> to me, I look at it, it's not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5610.601s">It's</a> not really rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5611.561s">There's</a> only one lawyer in this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5613.342s">There's</a> only one lawyer in this group that knows legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5618.6s">With</a> all due respect, it's been 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5621.202s">There</a> are serious problems in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5623.423s">The</a> water pipes, the streets falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5624.603s">We're</a> all in agreement on that.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5628.626s">And</a> power centralized into one office. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5632.408s">I</a> mean, I don't see this call-in center coming in and saying anything different than I'm saying right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5639.071s">I</a> welcome outside help. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5641.052s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5642.893s">But</a> at the end of the day, the citizens who <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5646.722s">live</a> here, work here, die here, pay all the taxes of a property tax that goes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5653.524s">Now</a> a surcharge on that property tax, a meals tax, a sales tax, God knows what else. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5659.586s">Some</a> businesses on the brink of closing down because of a three-year bridge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5665.728s">Something</a> has to be done.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5689.26s">I</a> agree.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5699.706s">I</a> am very passionate about it, but <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5703.321s">I'm</a> just worried about non-Medford residents coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5709.362s">If</a> they're a great group and they've had positive results in other cities, definitely let's look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=5715.604s">But</a> my main point is at the end of the day, this belongs to Medford.

<a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3886.501s">And</a> now the added CPA surcharge that's coming, barreling down, added to the water tax that I believe is going up by another 7 to 10% from the last committee of the whole meeting last week or the week before, plus the excise taxes, sales taxes, all these other taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3902.052s">And</a> this is why Massachusetts is known throughout the nation as tax-a-chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3907.618s">It's</a> literally outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3909.619s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3910.84s">And</a> I'm trying to articulate the rage that people that are watching that are feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3916.723s">And</a> I hope they know that there are people that understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3919.464s">Maybe</a> it will take a state rep or a state senator candidate or the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3924.993s">to</a> start proposing legislation at the state level to reduce surcharges on property taxes, which are in the end run around Prop 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3933.22s">You</a> know, the Moody's report that was just discussed in the committee of the whole meeting prior to this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3942.89s">stated</a> that, you know, they look at the surpluses here in Medford as great city management. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=3949.415s">Did</a> Moody's ever walk through this building and look at that?

received it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5260.696s">One</a> of the things that it says, which is just a general statement, that the state will match it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5269.863s">It</a> didn't give any percentage on what it would match. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5273.066s">At</a> first we heard 100%, then 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5276.509s">I</a> think the last official report from the state of Massachusetts says it's only going to match 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5281.453s">The</a> proponents for this argued a couple weeks ago <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5287.923s">It's</a> going to be a small increase to property taxes, $54. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5292.466s">Depending</a> on your land value, for some people that's upwards of a 40% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5299.99s">When</a> it gets to the business side of it, when I was looking this up earlier tonight, a place called Redstone and Stoneham, just for an example, the land, because this 100K cap <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5312.743s">which</a> is a little bit insignificant if you're in a higher tax rate, like Redstone is, like perhaps our Super Stop and Shop is, or the Meadow Glen Mall, or other industrial parks here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5325.365s">The</a> Redstone, for example, was assessed at something like $34,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5329.086s">Their</a> tax increase was significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5330.746s">It</a> was $5,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5331.106s">And</a> that gets passed on to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5342.564s">just</a> for people to understand what we might be getting into here and locked into it for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5356.291s">There</a> are also alternatives to this that people have been discussing that might be a better way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5367.476s">In</a> discussing this earlier today with a proponent <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5371.72s">for</a> the CPA, I made some suggestions as what might be an alternate route, and the person said it was a Band-Aid that doesn't provide a steady funding stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5388.495s">To</a> me, what a lot of the people in Medford are saying is we have seen <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5394.792s">A</a> property tax increase every year for 28 years, excise taxes, sales taxes that have gone up, income taxes, meals taxes, death taxes, taxes for businesses, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5410.246s">For</a> a proponent to tell me that we need a steady funding stream, I say it already exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5417.652s">We</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5418.64s">a</a> surplus between two different accounts are in Medford of almost $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5422.822s">We're</a> talking about a steady stream that's about 10 miles wide, 20 miles deep, and longer than the Mississippi River. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5430.205s">We</a> have the funds to do what the CPA is asking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5436.508s">In</a> my humble opinion, and just as an observance, what Medford could be doing as an alternative is, a few weeks ago, I went around Medford and I took a few pictures <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5448.364s">There's,</a> from the end of Salem Street near the Fellsway, all the way up to Forest Street, there's over 20 storefronts closed down, some of them boarded up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5459.811s">A</a> tax cut incentive to bring businesses in here would be the route to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5464.915s">A</a> property tax, either neutrality or cut, would be the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5470.018s">We</a> attract more people to move to Medford, Mr. President, and more businesses to come into Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5476.921s">What</a> are one of the other proposals by the CPA? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5479.583s">Affordable</a> housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5481.544s">Let's</a> get people jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5483.086s">Let's</a> attract businesses and people to move here by offering tax-cutting incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5490.451s">With</a> that added business growth and business venture and people working at a lot of these empty storefronts, they can afford on their own without having to rely on government and higher tax incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5505.357s">to</a> be able to afford their own houses with personal responsibility and self-dignity of doing it for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5513.84s">I</a> would just very much like to urge our city council and everybody watching, make your own decision, either for or against it, next Tuesday on voting on ballot question one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5527.323s">And</a> other cities and towns have <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5531.182s">accepted</a> it, about 154, I think it is, in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5535.625s">And</a> there are pros and cons to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5537.986s">And</a> some towns have already started, at least one, I think it's the town of Northampton, have started to try to repeal it after passing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5550.194s">And</a> that would come from city council initiative, should it pass next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5555.618s">And</a> if it don't, then it's not a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5561.67s">They</a> call this state, Taxachusetts, for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5565.411s">And</a> to continually raise our taxes, to argue for infrastructure repairs when we're already paying taxes ad infinitum, and we're not getting those necessary repairs now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5580.993s">I</a> mean, we've driven through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5583.474s">We</a> know the conditions of the streets, the roads, the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5586.554s">Another</a> thing, open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5589.395s">We</a> have Hormel Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5590.668s">We</a> have part of the sheepfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5591.949s">We</a> have, what, 26 parks in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5594.931s">We</a> already have a lot of open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5597.493s">We</a> already have a lot of money to make these infrastructure repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5601.316s">Just</a> those surpluses alone, I mean, I understand that some of the surpluses can't be touched, but maybe a new ballot initiative to maybe change that law could happen to appropriate the funds that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5617.909s">In</a> closing, I would just like to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5619.969s">Thank</a> you very much for the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5621.49s">I'm</a> not arguing either for or against us, just bringing up some ideas for people to ponder, for you good people to ponder as well, because you'll be voting next Tuesday, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5630.297s">I</a> thank you for your time, and good luck to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5633.059s">Good</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=5633.599s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Capucci.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1925.922s">Only</a> that it was brought up as a rumor by <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=1929.318s">Councilor</a> Brianna Lungo-Pratt.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8828.872s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8831.754s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8832.774s">Bob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8835.417s">I</a> just want to be really brief because I know other people are waiting to come and speak about other agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8842.242s">I</a> just want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8844.604s">Brady</a> for coming up and bringing this up, for Councilor Penta's remarks and for Chief Sacco's remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8851.489s">Obviously,</a> we all, everybody in this body, everybody that works in this building, we all have a passion and love for Medford, but this pay-to-park kiosk program <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8860.455s">The</a> way it was implemented and the way it's been working, or a lack thereof, is disastrous for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8868.021s">I</a> have been working on another project, and a week ago from Saturday, I started at the end of Salem Street, where it intersects with the Fellsway, before Malden, and I stalked at Forest Street, just taking pictures of businesses that were once there that are gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8883.654s">I</a> have pictures of over 20 businesses in that eight block radius that are gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8889.935s">I'm</a> not blaming that on the pay-to-park kiosk program, but with all due respect, we're talking about being realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8897.458s">The</a> small businesses in this community that provide the jobs and this city makes money off of through sales tax and mails tax and whatnot are the reasons why, partly, we have a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8911.322s">And</a> if we focused, you know, hindsight's 20-20, but if we focused years ago on <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8919.823s">going</a> to bat in supporting small businesses, and we didn't lose these 20 businesses, we would have had the funding for Chief Sacco to have a full and adequate police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8932.812s">I</a> mean, God bless him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8933.612s">He's</a> doing the best he can with the manpower he has. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8937.195s">And</a> with the national feeling going on about police officers in general in the country, he deserves a real <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8945.653s">applaud</a> him and every officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8947.834s">But</a> if we had the full and adequate police force built upon providing the support that we can to these small businesses going back years ago, it's not that the business owners are parking in front of their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8965.821s">The</a> problem was in the past was that because Chief Sacco doesn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8970.065s">an</a> adequate police force to enforce the laws that are already on the books for traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8976.366s">We</a> have people from other cities and towns coming here, parking all day right in front of these businesses, and then getting on the T and going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8984.008s">That</a> was the real problem, not the business owners parking in front of their places of establishment all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8993.17s">The</a> gentleman who owns the gas station right across from the West Medford post office, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9000.373s">A</a> few weeks ago, I was talking to him and he said, you come out here at 11 o'clock in the morning and you look up this street that was once parked with cars and all these small businesses were making money off, it's gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9012.581s">We're</a> losing money, businesses, jobs, revenues being collected because of this pay to park kiosk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9021.566s">And</a> I hope that the next mayoral administration will exercise the buyout option and get rid of it <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9028.233s">provide</a> the infrastructure and support for small businesses to take the place of these 20 businesses that are on this phone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9034.223s">I'll</a> email you the pictures if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9036.847s">And</a> we have that level of economic engine activity again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9043.39s">And</a> with the two surpluses we have, with all that money coming in, we can hire a full police force for Chief Sackle to get the officers out there, not even to mention all the construction programs that are going on, to have Chief Sackle with a full police force to implement the traffic laws that are already on hand, then we wouldn't be experiencing a lot of these problems, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9064.959s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3548.293s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3548.793s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3550.795s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3552.035s">I'm</a> Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3555.478s">It</a> was about four years ago, I want to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3559.892s">Another</a> resident of Medford and I tried to establish a charter review committee, Dr. Stirella, that you are all very aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3572.601s">From</a> my perspective, it's a huge undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3575.464s">I</a> think we had to get something like 10,000 signatures just to get it on the ballot, and then it has to be voted on by the city at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3586.467s">either</a> the mayor or this body could vote to have one formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3593.77s">My</a> support of a charter review commission or committee or whatever you want to call it stems from just a couple of simple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3603.453s">We've</a> been operating under the plan A strong mayor charter now for almost 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3609.876s">And</a> I just think it's prudent, practical, logical just to establish a review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3616.852s">to</a> see if that's the way we want to continue functioning our city government in the manner we've been operating it for decades now, almost three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3628.458s">Many</a> businesses out there from 1988 we're talking here, maybe earlier, just don't operate under the same business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3637.523s">And</a> I just think it makes sense for us to review it, especially with certain things that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3645.367s">I'll</a> stick to the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3647.222s">But</a> I mean, there are reasons why we want to review the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3651.525s">We're</a> understaffed in the police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3653.866s">The</a> building's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3655.487s">There's</a> water and sewer pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3658.108s">There's</a> pay scales. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3659.569s">There's</a> all sorts of reasons why we want to look at the charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3663.551s">And</a> another reason to look at it is maybe we want to change it to go to ward representation as opposed to at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3673.476s">Because</a> I really think that's a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3677.407s">I</a> know that some of you councillors are against that because it kind of like pits the city against each other, but I think that spirit of competition is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3687.309s">I</a> think when you have, like what we were talking about earlier tonight, you got the Heights, they could have like their representative on the city council, and that person could be doing all they could to become specialized and expert <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3704.967s">and</a> experts on knowing what's going to go up there at the Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3708.67s">And,</a> you know, there's all sorts of horse trading. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3712.012s">We</a> all know who pay attention and are active in politics, the way things get advanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3718.916s">And,</a> you know, when you have different representations from different wards, it just seems in that spirit of competition, we hold each other to higher standards and more things get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3732.497s">And</a> finally, on the topic of ward representation, that I really think this city needs, it affords the opportunity for more voices to rise, for a diversity in background, for people to get elected in their ward, to run a smaller, more economical campaign, so that we get more different people <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3760.532s">up</a> here on this body, with all due respect, are that the ward can, you know, keep electing the same representative for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3768.939s">It's</a> not that I am kind of for term limits, but I'm not against having, you know, the same representatives for sometimes decades at a time, some of whom I like very much and I would personally keep voting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3785.433s">But</a> again, it all comes back to opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3788.512s">and</a> providing as much opportunity for more citizens who may want to run that might not be able to afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3796.937s">I</a> mean, there were tens of thousands of dollars spent in the city election in 2013 by one candidate on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3806.943s">And</a> I mean, I won't mention who. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3808.423s">People</a> can look up the public record and find out for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3811.885s">But</a> that's a lot of money to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3815.491s">for</a> a job that pays much less than what was spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3818.752s">Under</a> ward representation, somebody could possibly win a city council seat for maybe $1,000, $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3826.535s">It's</a> just better to review our city charter after so many years, to look at the way city government runs, to look at some of the problems we're having in this city, and maybe open doors for new people to rise up and have a voice, because we're privileged <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3843.825s">to</a> live in a country where we have the freedoms that we have and the opportunities that we have, and to expand these freedoms and these opportunities only makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3854.511s">I</a> hope that this body, after hearing from more citizens, will deeply consider and move forward on establishing a charter commission committee and review. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3868.44s">Thank</a> you very much for your time.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7873.519s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7874.999s">I</a> promise this will be the last time I come to the podium tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7878.12s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7880.78s">Through</a> the chair, I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Vice President, for bringing up this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7886.161s">This</a> past Sunday, April 5th, marked 12 years to the day that my best friend died on an overdose of OxyContin that he bought illegally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7897.8s">While</a> I strongly advocate being a former teacher, strong educational programs, teaching our youngsters the problems in the health issues and even the death that could arise through using drugs, I would like to ask that this council please place emphasis on the criminal aspect of what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7923.289s">Councilor</a> Marks, in an earlier discussion, brought up low staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7927.53s">We</a> don't have a full police force here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7931.171s">And</a> Councilor Caraviello brought up the DARE officer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7936.553s">My</a> question is, you know, how many people that are out there selling illegal drugs to our youngsters and our students, how many of them are being arrested? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7947.056s">If</a> my friend 12 years ago, you know, from the person, whoever it was, he bought <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7952.239s">illegal</a> Oxycontin from got arrested the day before, maybe that night he wouldn't have illegally purchased these drugs and got arrested. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7962.106s">And</a> if it's doctors doing it, I hope that there's some aspect of looking into them to get them arrested and losing their license. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7971.873s">We</a> need a strong, fully staffed police force so that they can go out and do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7977.677s">Now,</a> I'm obviously speaking out of turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7981.975s">Chief</a> Sacco is doing everything he can with what he has, and there may be answers to the questions I'm bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7990.318s">And</a> I'd like to know how many arrests were made in the last month, in the last three months, the last year, on people selling drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7998.841s">That</a> kind of prevention, from a legal standpoint, I think needs some emphasis as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8004.163s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8052.092s">I</a> wasn't aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8053.292s">I</a> just hope more arrests are being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8056.313s">And</a> thank you for informing me on that, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8059.373s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8059.934s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8061.174s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8061.834s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, sir.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E/2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E.html">Medford City Council - March 31, 2015  (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6032.409s">Thank</a> you so much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6035.465s">deeply</a> take that under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=6037.266s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1121.111s">Well,</a> if I may, I specifically returned to this podium and I asked the direct question, does this amendment mean, at the time, the MWRA wanted to raise our rates by 10%, but then after this whole debate and passing of the amendment for the $600,000 to come out, I returned and I asked specifically, and I believe it was the Honorable Michael Marks who said the answer to my question, which was, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1149.427s">Does</a> this mean that nobody in Medford will see a water rate increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1153.069s">And</a> the answer was directly given to me, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1156.431s">Now</a> you're saying that under this tiered rate, some people are actually and some businesses are actually going to see somewhat of an increase?

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3875.556s">Sir,</a> state your name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3877.898s">Robert</a> Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3880.54s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3881.661s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3884.944s">Today</a> at the Immaculate Conception in Malden, I just want to ask maybe for a moment of silence if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3892.891s">There</a> were almost 100 priests, at least a dozen bishops, His Eminence Cardinal Sean, and the pastor of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3901.938s">Raphael's,</a> Father Toomey, who gave the homily. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3904.608s">for</a> the passing of Father Richard Meem, who was the pastor at Immaculate Conception Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3912.152s">I</a> also want to thank Council President Dello Russo for coming last night to his wake, and his Honor the Mayor, who both came, Michael McGlynn, to the wake and to the funeral services today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3924.037s">It</a> was a real boost to the family to have those dignitaries from Medford come <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3930.915s">I</a> am a member of the Immaculate Conception Parish, as are many people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3935.477s">So</a> Father Meem had a very big impact on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3939.979s">As</a> a Knight of Columbus there, Father Meem was constantly coming to the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3945.421s">He</a> was a man of true character. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3949.703s">When</a> Father Meem started succumbing to his illness at the beginning of last week on Monday, I actually saw Cardinal Sean <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3959.607s">at</a> an assembly in Faneuil Hall two Sundays ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3963.108s">And</a> I said, Your Eminence, if you please would say a prayer for Father Meem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3967.109s">He's</a> taken ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3968.69s">And</a> apparently, the prayer was answered with God calling him home to go on to be with God. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3977.072s">But</a> the next day, when it was clear that Father Meem was unfortunately going to pass, Cardinal Sean, this is just a testament to Father Meem's character. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3988.983s">Cardinal</a> Sean went to visit him to inform him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3992.985s">I</a> mean, his whole family around him, the man saw all his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3997.968s">He</a> knew people were very, very morose because a loving family member and a good friend was dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4006.052s">Cardinal</a> Sean informed him that his Holy Father, the Pope in Rome, had elevated Father Mime to Monsignor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4015.497s">And</a> this is a true testament to his character, his response <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4018.943s">was,</a> well, it's about time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4022.426s">And</a> they all, I mean, here's a man who immediately relieves the morosity of the situation for his family and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4032.274s">And</a> it was just such a wonderful homily today by Father Toomey of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4036.037s">Raphael's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4036.757s">And</a> if I could, I could please, I mean, a lot of folks in Medford would love probably to have just a brief moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4043.863s">And</a> thank you so much, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4066.115s">If</a> I could just add to really quick that our own city solicitor, Mark Rumley, who's the deacon of our parish too, was also very comforting and inhaling at a time of serious grief. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4078.321s">And</a> I want to thank him for his <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4082.212s">outstanding</a> leader as a spiritual leader in my parish and church. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4087.915s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5880.671s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evett Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5882.612s">If</a> I could just add a request, because Councilor Camuso brought up the towers in Burlington, if it is at all possible to find out from the safety department if this tower's given off any radiation, because a lot of those towers do, that could be another <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5901.694s">public</a> safety concern.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8829.772s">The</a> matter is disposed of, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8832.695s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8834.776s">Robert</a> Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8838.379s">I</a> didn't plan on speaking on this tonight, but a couple of points came up that I had to voice my concern about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8844.722s">With</a> all due respect to the Chief of Police, who has been exhaustive in his energies on this kiosk program, he referred to concerns that people have and the questions that are coming up as throwing stones <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8859.89s">on</a> something that we haven't even seen if it works yet, when on a issue brought up tonight by Councilor Penter, it clearly states, Medford citizenry never had an open public opportunity for input, discussions, concerns of the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8877.159s">Is</a> it throwing stones? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8879.14s">And</a> with all due respect, I have great respect for the Chief of Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8883.743s">I</a> just wish he would term it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8885.664s">Was</a> it throwing stones for Jimmy's pizza? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8888.37s">To</a> come up here and address his concerns, was it throwing stones for the woman who talked about Playstead Road and what she has to do to get a permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8898.173s">Was</a> it throwing stones for the guy who owns the lock company? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8901.374s">Was</a> it throwing stones for all the other citizens and businesses that have come up here? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8906.536s">And</a> my second point is on the 30-minute parking amendment, a query posed by the Honourable Michael Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8917.2s">That's</a> never going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8918.384s">because</a> that will get rid of all the money these folks are going to be collecting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8924.73s">I</a> have seen for the last few weeks, going into months now, the great concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8931.636s">I</a> mean, we're talking about making Medford more business friendly and improving our five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8937.541s">Welcome</a> to Medford with higher property tax rates, pay to park, the streets falling apart, an understaffed police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8944.487s">I</a> mean, there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8945.802s">a</a> lot more things this city could be doing and it's ultimately going to depend on the voters this year and to exercise that option in this contract to buy it out and get rid of it, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8959.59s">It</a> would be the best thing for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8962.572s">Thank</a> you for your time.
