    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2699.579s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you to the organizers for this event tonight, so that these candidates can come and bring our message to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2707.363s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Capucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2708.363s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm 47 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2710.164s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm the youngest of seven kids in my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2712.825s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm a lifelong Medford resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2715.406s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I graduated from Franklin Pierce College in 1994.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2718.828s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I went into teaching, and then after a few years of that, I joined the Army Reserves, and I currently work in electronics, making laser scalpels for a company up in Lexington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2729.743s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I heard a lot of the candidates touch upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2732.62s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The issues that were sent to us, the city committee here sent us actually 30 different topics to discuss with five minutes to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2742.746s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So I chose five, and I'm going to just answer them directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2746.449s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The number one I chose was the opioid crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2750.471s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I lost my best friend in 2003 to drug addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2755.374s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: A couple weeks ago, at 46 years old, he had to bury a high school graduate, a classmate of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2761.818s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's the number one killer of people under 50 years old in America, and it needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2769.203s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think Medford should start leading the way in research and how many prescriptions are actually being given for opioids, to whom, for what purposes, and to investigate to our fullest to ensure every single prescription is right and proper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2783.333s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I will continue to support and advocate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2785.701s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for worthwhile community programs like candlelight vigils, various drug addiction rehab facilities and groups, and other initiatives we have here in Medford such as Team Medford and the new drug officer recently appointed by the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2801.669s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'd also like to establish here in Medford a kind of a tough love approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2806.767s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and send out coordinated, communicated messages to all the residents on a regular basis to get people to realize their problem and light a fire under their butts to get the help that they need so they stop dying and they can enjoy the holidays, child graduations, weddings, all the things that make this life worth living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2829.675s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The Medford City Council should start leading the way on this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2833.937s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: The next topic I want to talk about is inclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2837.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think the best way we can be more inclusive of our diversity here in Medford is something that I've been calling for throughout my campaign and for years before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2851.362s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and it was highlighted just last night in these chambers by the excellent speech of Dr. John Stirella of Metcalf Street in two words, term limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2861.877s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If we had a three-term term limit for the elected right now in Medford, there would be five open seats on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2868.846s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for this city to take advantage of and run for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2872.147s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: There would be four seats on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2874.208s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We'd have two new challenging candidates for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2878.349s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Nothing else would lead the way to include the diverse population we have in Medford so that we can hear from all different kinds of people to come up here and act, all different new ideas, new initiatives to include all of Medford in our wonderful city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2894.455s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2895.535s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I recently had a conversation with the manager of Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2900.013s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We discussed something that was recently featured on a news program, Chronicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2904.876s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That report was called the Amazon effect, whereby mom-and-pop shops across Medford, across Massachusetts, across the country are getting walloped because more people can easily just go online and order from various, you know, internet services, and they're not being able to keep up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2926.423s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: these internet companies, the mom and pop shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2928.987s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So what cities and towns are doing to combat this and make our city squares more attractive is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2935.864s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Offer no-fee parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2938.446s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I lead the way to get us out of the contract with Republic Parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2942.048s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need to revitalize these city squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2944.05s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2945.471s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If we offer no-fee parking with strict two-hour limits so that we don't have that problem we used to have that's probably still going on on the outskirts of the city, we make sure that people that come here and park and leave their cars all day, after two hours, they're towed at their own expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2964.123s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2966.075s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I am actually for the city to collect more taxes and have more taxes in their coffers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2973.92s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We need these funds for hiring more police, firefighters, teachers, teachers' aides, infrastructure repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2981.425s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What I don't believe in... 20 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2983.686s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Oh, really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2984.026s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That quick already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2985.007s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Gee whiz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2987.82s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Well, what I don't believe in is constantly raising the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2991.282s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: What I think is what we do is we create more taxpayers, and the way we do that is to cut taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2996.605s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: With my last few seconds, I want to make an appeal to the 28,000 registered voters who don't vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3002.789s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Come out and vote on November 7th for Robert Cappucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3005.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3006.351s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That was really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1379.726s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4067.982s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4070.424s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4071.564s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4075.526s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4082.67s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4093.997s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4098.24s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4099.641s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4100.521s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution, there are laws that govern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4103.553s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4106.696s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4122.83s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4129.494s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4135.257s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4141.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4157.726s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: On the state level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4159.969s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4163.972s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4166.995s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4184.93s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think that for a city like Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4189.269s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: for a group like Safe Medford to come along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4192.273s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4198.641s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4205.28s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4223.562s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4230.808s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4242.417s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll leave you with this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4245.779s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is Medford being a welcoming city by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4250.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: basically subverting the rule of U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4252.508s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4263.682s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When a new resident or a new business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4266.145s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4274.934s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4281.921s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are the city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4283.043s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4286.106s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's a welcoming city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4288.688s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4289.861s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4295.566s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4297.347s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4298.208s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6048.013s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6049.093s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6050.834s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6053.156s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6057.776s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6061.039s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6064.783s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6082.819s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6088.844s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6106.377s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6113.289s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6116.115s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also want to address the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6118.937s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6129.246s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with limited government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6132.328s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6137.933s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6145.038s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In the current policy of not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6147.521s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: ask an immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6149.163s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6154.77s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6161.36s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6174.946s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6180.708s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6195.298s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Massachusetts never<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6197.591s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6200.692s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I really don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6202.653s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6214.518s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6218.46s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6223.102s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6227.344s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6235.227s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And those laws have to be respected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6237.288s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6241.963s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6243.104s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6264.374s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6272.88s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're actually putting a target on their back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.122s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.247s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Testing, 1, 2, 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.727s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=354.907s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3384.034s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3386.475s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3387.655s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3391.601s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3398.765s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3410.072s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3414.335s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3415.736s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3416.616s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution, there are laws that govern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3419.642s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3422.785s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3438.96s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're subverting the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3441.075s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3451.38s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3457.142s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3465.286s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3473.792s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: On the state level, among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3480.057s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3483.079s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So the costs coming in don't—<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3487.771s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3500.994s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't think that for a city like Medford, for a group like Safe Medford to come along and, you know, this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3514.717s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's a matter of respect for the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3517.958s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: in becoming a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3521.761s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3539.62s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3546.862s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And under the guise of the feel good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3558.484s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll leave you with this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3561.825s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Is Medford being a welcoming city by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3566.24s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: basically subverting the rule of U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3568.583s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3579.735s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: When a new resident or a new business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3582.217s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3591.003s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3597.987s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here are the city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3599.088s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3602.17s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's a welcoming city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3604.752s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3605.953s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3611.637s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Constitution is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3612.778s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=3614.3s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5364.0s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5365.061s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5366.803s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5369.125s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5373.746s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5377.009s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5380.753s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5398.792s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5404.814s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5422.339s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear mongering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5429.262s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5432.088s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I also want to address the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5434.91s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5445.234s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with limited government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5448.315s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5453.917s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5461.04s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: In the current policy of not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5463.564s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: ask an immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5465.185s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5470.75s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5477.332s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5490.936s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5496.697s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5511.288s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Massachusetts never signed on to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5513.598s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5516.722s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And I really don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5518.684s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5530.539s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5534.482s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5539.105s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5543.368s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5551.233s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And those laws have to be respected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5553.955s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5557.967s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5559.128s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever was in power of immigration to know where to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5580.409s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: So it's actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5582.931s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5588.894s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You're actually putting a target on their back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5591.135s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5591.715s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10169.448s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10170.993s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10171.413s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I'm Rob Caputi of 71 Evans street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10173.795s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing, bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10180.221s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I just want to say, I mean, I, this is a very important issue to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10186.426s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Uh, what, what's actually going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10190.026s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: with this tax and all the other taxes is the businesses and residents, they're not going to pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10195.429s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: They're going to pass these costs along to people that rent, to people that buy goods and services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10201.732s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: You know, I've been sitting in these subcommittee meetings that this honorable body has been having on the budget and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10210.186s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: To see an issue like this come, and then to hear different department heads, like the chief of police talking about he asked for five new police officers, and that was denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10221.194s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And it's explained off that they're going to be hiring civil dispatchers, and that will bring in more police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10231.903s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But in actuality, that's not really going to bring in more police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10235.846s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I mean, it's just very confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10238.988s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and frustrating to the citizens who are seeing things like My Street, Evans Street, and all the infrastructure repairs that are needed across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10248.791s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: To see other ways of bringing money into the city, rather than direct tax or new connectivity fees, to look at the budget that's being proposed here, to see only $97,000, I think the figure is, for the Chevalier Theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10265.404s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: that could be bringing in so much more money, an increase to the investment, to that treasure of a theater, where we could actually bring in enough money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10281.055s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: by bringing in bigger names with more investment to that almost 2,000 seat theater to see the increase in sales and whatnot to our downtown business district that's being crippled by the Craddock Bridge repair, and then use that money to actually really reduce water rates and property rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10301.414s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: and so many other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10305.039s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: $1,200,000 taken in by the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10310.665s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: To see that when we know we have surpluses in other areas, I mean, to me that's money taken out of the economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10318.615s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: It's going away from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10320.0s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: from people being able to pay a better rent in Medford or a better mortgage or better prices for goods and services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10330.108s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think Mr. Penter is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10332.13s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: I think this body should stand up on this and sit down with the mayor in these subcommittee meetings that I've been going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10341.938s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Sometimes department heads coming without full facts on each decimal point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10349.133s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Sometimes department heads might even be in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10351.554s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Sometimes the Hormel commission department wasn't there on, on Saturday morning, I believe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10358.778s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: And then wondering why, why is there a Hormel commission in a, in a park commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10364.12s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Why, why isn't that one, one, one commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10369.303s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Yeah, I am wondering about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10382.147s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Well, I guess that explains that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10384.668s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: But why can't, through maybe Hormel petition, we combine the two, like we've done in other things, like Councilor Marks brought up on Saturday morning at the subcommittee meeting, different ways that this body has brought other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10402.56s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: like the Traffic Commission, I think it was, and the Off-Street Parking Commission into one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10407.563s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: That's what I'm hoping to see more of when I go to these subcommittee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10410.885s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: Streamlining government, making it smaller, more responsible, more effective, more transparent and accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10417.566s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>: uh, to see all these dollar amounts too, that are coming in for 450,000 that was budgeted for 2017.<br><br>
