 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2699.579s">Thank</a> you to the organizers for this event tonight, so that these candidates can come and bring our message to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2707.363s">I'm</a> Robert Capucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2708.363s">I'm</a> 47 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2710.164s">I'm</a> the youngest of seven kids in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2712.825s">I'm</a> a lifelong Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2715.406s">I</a> graduated from Franklin Pierce College in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2718.828s">I</a> went into teaching, and then after a few years of that, I joined the Army Reserves, and I currently work in electronics, making laser scalpels for a company up in Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2729.743s">I</a> heard a lot of the candidates touch upon <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2732.62s">The</a> issues that were sent to us, the city committee here sent us actually 30 different topics to discuss with five minutes to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2742.746s">So</a> I chose five, and I'm going to just answer them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2746.449s">The</a> number one I chose was the opioid crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2750.471s">I</a> lost my best friend in 2003 to drug addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2755.374s">A</a> couple weeks ago, at 46 years old, he had to bury a high school graduate, a classmate of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2761.818s">It's</a> the number one killer of people under 50 years old in America, and it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2769.203s">I</a> think Medford should start leading the way in research and how many prescriptions are actually being given for opioids, to whom, for what purposes, and to investigate to our fullest to ensure every single prescription is right and proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2783.333s">I</a> will continue to support and advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2785.701s">for</a> worthwhile community programs like candlelight vigils, various drug addiction rehab facilities and groups, and other initiatives we have here in Medford such as Team Medford and the new drug officer recently appointed by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2801.669s">I'd</a> also like to establish here in Medford a kind of a tough love approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2806.767s">and</a> send out coordinated, communicated messages to all the residents on a regular basis to get people to realize their problem and light a fire under their butts to get the help that they need so they stop dying and they can enjoy the holidays, child graduations, weddings, all the things that make this life worth living. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2829.675s">The</a> Medford City Council should start leading the way on this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2833.937s">The</a> next topic I want to talk about is inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2837.079s">I</a> think the best way we can be more inclusive of our diversity here in Medford is something that I've been calling for throughout my campaign and for years before. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2851.362s">and</a> it was highlighted just last night in these chambers by the excellent speech of Dr. John Stirella of Metcalf Street in two words, term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2861.877s">If</a> we had a three-term term limit for the elected right now in Medford, there would be five open seats on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2868.846s">for</a> this city to take advantage of and run for. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2872.147s">There</a> would be four seats on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2874.208s">We'd</a> have two new challenging candidates for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2878.349s">Nothing</a> else would lead the way to include the diverse population we have in Medford so that we can hear from all different kinds of people to come up here and act, all different new ideas, new initiatives to include all of Medford in our wonderful city. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2894.455s">Parking.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2895.535s">I</a> recently had a conversation with the manager of Carol's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2900.013s">We</a> discussed something that was recently featured on a news program, Chronicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2904.876s">That</a> report was called the Amazon effect, whereby mom-and-pop shops across Medford, across Massachusetts, across the country are getting walloped because more people can easily just go online and order from various, you know, internet services, and they're not being able to keep up with <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2926.423s">these</a> internet companies, the mom and pop shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2928.987s">So</a> what cities and towns are doing to combat this and make our city squares more attractive is <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2935.864s">Offer</a> no-fee parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2938.446s">I</a> lead the way to get us out of the contract with Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2942.048s">We</a> need to revitalize these city squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2944.05s">That's</a> the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2945.471s">If</a> we offer no-fee parking with strict two-hour limits so that we don't have that problem we used to have that's probably still going on on the outskirts of the city, we make sure that people that come here and park and leave their cars all day, after two hours, they're towed at their own expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2964.123s">Taxes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2966.075s">I</a> am actually for the city to collect more taxes and have more taxes in their coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2973.92s">We</a> need these funds for hiring more police, firefighters, teachers, teachers' aides, infrastructure repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2981.425s">What</a> I don't believe in... 20 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2983.686s">Oh,</a> really? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2984.026s">That</a> quick already? <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2985.007s">Gee</a> whiz. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2987.82s">Well,</a> what I don't believe in is constantly raising the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2991.282s">What</a> I think is what we do is we create more taxpayers, and the way we do that is to cut taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2996.605s">With</a> my last few seconds, I want to make an appeal to the 28,000 registered voters who don't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3002.789s">Come</a> out and vote on November 7th for Robert Cappucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3005.771s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3006.351s">That</a> was really good.<h2><a href="../2017-04-20_pHtJcMxcqAQ/2017-04-20_pHtJcMxcqAQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 18, 2017 (Unofficially

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7998.008s">Name</a> and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7999.848s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8001.089s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8003.952s">If</a> I could, through the Chair, I understand this is, she's part of the Community Preservation Commission.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8015.059s">In</a> vetting her out, I think it would be prudent to ask the question, exactly how does this commission work? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8022.664s">From</a> my understanding in reading the law is that they get to decide how the funds are spent, but people from the citizenry can also solicit <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8033.87s">the</a> Community Preservation Commission for funds.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8053.893s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=8054.294s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9055.944s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9057.865s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9059.105s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9061.846s">Through</a> the chair, I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and bringing this information forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9067.047s">Mr.</a> President, on two separate other debating topics tonight, the vetting of the new <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9073.492s">Community</a> Preservation Commission, a new shadow government in Medford, and on Councilor Lungo-Koehn's resolution about the demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9081.801s">A</a> lot of talk was generated on affordable housing and preserving historic landmarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9089.77s">Here's</a> a great opportunity to give a little bit more affordable housing to the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9096.21s">And</a> as far as historical landmarks go, how about our senior citizens, like my mother, who's 78 years old, who is a historic person as far as I'm concerned here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9107.099s">This</a> charge, Mr. President, and I'm a little passionate about this, is outrageous, especially when Councilor Marks refers to the fact that there's $8 million <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9117.347s">in</a> an overtaxed account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9119.208s">Here's</a> a great opportunity to provide a little bit more affordable housing to the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9124.652s">And</a> we shouldn't wait until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9126.793s">The</a> power of this body should somehow find a way to kill this now, not wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9132.276s">May</a> 2nd will be the Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9134.077s">And</a> on that point, because this is such an important matter, perhaps that Committee of the Whole meeting should be in this chamber, under the TV, so people at home can watch this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9146.83s">It's</a> unfortunate that that meeting is not available to the whole public through technology in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9156.577s">To</a> me, I'm sorry, this is really outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9161.52s">Something</a> should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9163.421s">In</a> terms of talking about affordability for the residents of Medford, another speaker spoke earlier tonight about how the rents are going way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9175.109s">Why</a> do you think that is? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9177.185s">When</a> the property taxes are always going up, our sales taxes, excise taxes, excess in taxes, a cash account with another $10 million into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9187.45s">This</a> stuff trickles downhill, Mr. President, in the lower income, in the middle income, and the poor people are the ones who end up paying all of these excessive costs for living in the city of Medford, especially when there's a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9202.107s">Mr.</a> President... May 2nd, voice your concerns that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9205.189s">I'm</a> voicing them here and now, too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9207.07s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9207.51s">It's</a> outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9208.31s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9208.531s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10930.089s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10931.45s">I'm</a> Robert Cappucci Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10934.752s">I'll</a> try to be brief at this late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10937.934s">Last</a> summer, it was proposed that the city move towards <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10943.498s">municipal</a> aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10953.22s">It</a> went away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10954.38s">Somehow</a> it came back last Tuesday in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, go green. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10965.262s">There</a> was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10972.229s">by</a> Alicia Hunt, the Director of Energy and Environment here in Medford, the Chairman of the Go Green Medford Community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10980.914s">Basically,</a> for the citizens that are watching at home, it's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11001.413s">Understandably,</a> what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11006.254s">There</a> was also a 30-day opt-out clause in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11011.375s">But</a> Councilor Marks at the Committee of the Whole meeting brought up the state law, which is after 180 days, you cannot opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11020.256s">And</a> getting into these government contracts, doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11029.799s">But</a> the state law says something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11031.76s">I'm</a> a little bit skeptical of the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11036.282s">If</a> this is really such a good thing, they should present it and market it to the people as an opt-in if they want to, not force everybody all at once to be a part of this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11048.387s">I</a> mean, that's a slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11050.168s">Where</a> does it end? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11050.968s">Is</a> the city council going to vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11054.997s">another</a> company buys all my clothes for me, all my groceries, it's a dangerous precedent that we're setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11063.281s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11064.262s">But</a> I want to be fair to the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11068.364s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo at the Committee of the Whole meeting was very astute in bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11074.888s">So</a> I emailed everybody on this council, the Citizens Against Municipal Aggregation website. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11081.371s">I</a> also included the mayor and <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11083.792s">Alicia</a> hunt the director of environment and engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11087.117s">I'm</a> also going to reach out to them if this ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11093.885s">I</a> just find it just comforting that the city would entertain a notion <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11101.482s">of</a> doing something on behalf of every resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11105.384s">From</a> reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11110.347s">And</a> if you are locked into it and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day you do try to get out, for some reason you can't, and a lower rate comes, I mean, you can go to <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11121.053s">The</a> two sources now, it's an Eversource and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11124.534s">And</a> you can click on them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11126.295s">And</a> under those, a ton of other options come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11129.956s">There</a> are choices for citizens to make right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11132.717s">They</a> can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11139.119s">That</a> choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=11146.422s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2016-10-29_Oj3ns4r1Qn4/2016-10-29_Oj3ns4r1Qn4.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 18, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4012.348s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4012.929s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4013.329s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4015.491s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4016.793s">Rob</a> Capucci is 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4019.856s">Uh,</a> I don't know how feasible it is, is for the city, but if an extra set of eyes is, is needed, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4027.85s">I</a> know neighboring communities like Cambridge, they have cameras at intersections and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4034.731s">And</a> if people are, I mean, I've never personally seen anybody blow off a crossing guard, but if people are, I mean, that's a very serious issue that drastic measures have to definitely be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4048.594s">And</a> on the matter of hiring auxiliary, last Tuesday night when I presented that humble suggestion, the next day actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4057.89s">I</a> walk my dog at the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4059.47s">I</a> spoke to a guy who used to be an auxiliary police officer and, um, they're, they're invaluable in terms of the service that they provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4068.873s">If</a> they're only working 20 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4071.114s">I</a> mean, this guy personally actually, uh, caught down and tracked a, a, uh, an offender. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4079.116s">I</a> won't say of what nature, but, uh, um, I wonder if the city knows when, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4086.504s">We</a> did get rid of the auxiliary police we used to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4088.985s">I</a> know growing up in the 70s and 80s, we used to call them parkies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4092.385s">There</a> used to be a cop at every park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4095.986s">But</a> we've got rid of that program, and I'm wondering why, just if it was budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4100.607s">If</a> you can find out, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4103.568s">And</a> look into it, whatever you can do for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4106.788s">It's</a> really government's first issue is protection of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4110.269s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI/2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3172.65s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3173.21s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3173.59s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3175.595s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3176.876s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3179.297s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this discussion to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3184.68s">I've</a> attended many of those town meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3188.442s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing these into the neighbourhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3192.545s">That</a> kind of a turnout is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3195.106s">I</a> missed the first two of this year because I just got a new puppy, but I usually regularly attend those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3201.73s">I</a> don't know what the city law is or the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3205.73s">But</a> perhaps to alleviate some of these traffic and public safety issues, you know, with budgeting being as it is, perhaps Medford could incorporate an auxiliary police force or a special police force that reserves part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3223.698s">They</a> could be armed or unarmed or unpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3226.599s">I</a> briefly looked it up before I came up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3230.08s">There's</a> about 10 towns in Bristol County that <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3234.346s">utilizes</a> an auxiliary force that, you know, if they're youngsters, as Councilor Marks alluded to, there's a lot of people in this city that want to contribute, that want to volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3245.614s">I</a> bet you could find at least 20, 30 people that would be happy to volunteer their time on a part-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3253.233s">to</a> help alleviate some of these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3256.375s">Councilor</a> Mark said something earlier, with all due respect, about, you know, they'll find a way to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3263.42s">Haven't</a> gone to these town meetings for pretty much regularly for about three or four years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3270.385s">It's</a> really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3271.486s">When</a> Chief Sacco says that he needs the manpower, he really means it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3276.149s">You</a> could have some officers that, you know, are working undercover. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3280.577s">of</a> others that work in phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3283.139s">He's</a> very understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3284.94s">He</a> needs about another 25 or 30 officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3287.962s">Now</a> I know the mayor just freed up a few months ago about 10 dispatches so that they could offset that and hire 10 new police. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3296.048s">But</a> at the same time, they lost 10 police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3298.77s">So</a> they really didn't gain one more officer from that move. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3303.253s">So</a> I'm just up to offer a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3305.434s">Maybe</a> the city council could, working with the mayor's office, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3310.187s">get</a> the advice, of course, of Chief Sacco, who would know more, consider an auxiliary reserve police force that would help ensure all of the concerns that were brought up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3321.494s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3322.695s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3539.816s">I'm</a> speaking directly to Evans Street.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4638.344s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4639.765s">Uh,</a> it's actually Robert L Capucci, uh, of 71 Evans street, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4644.111s">if</a> I could just submit this petition that I collected from my fellow neighbors on Evans Street and on the corners of the street as well, Central and Lawrence Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4658.837s">Basically,</a> we, the undersigned residents and abutters to Evans Street, demand our water pipes fixed and street repaved as promised by the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4668.801s">I</a> got 50 signatures from fellow residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4672.843s">The</a> reason <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4673.94s">You</a> folks might have received some emails today from Pinkett Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4677.122s">It's</a> because, you know, with time constraints, I couldn't go down that street and get their signatures as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4684.148s">But</a> I did go down that street and I put out a flyer with everybody's email and the mayor's as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4690.213s">If</a> I could submit that to the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4692.615s">Please</a> submit that to the messenger who will submit it to the city clerk and make it part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4698.279s">Okay,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4699.92s">No,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4700.621s">But,</a> you know, a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4704.217s">A</a> fellow neighbor of mine, Shauna Smith and I came up, and we discussed this street, and it was, what's the word? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4715.38s">It</a> was mutually agreed that Evans Street, I mean, I don't wanna rehash everything that was already said here tonight, but Evans Street is in one of the top five of direly needed repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4727.61s">Council</a> Vice President Lungo-Koehn is exactly right, that this street, I mean, let's put that into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4734.991s">65</a> years it's been since this street has been repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4740.572s">You</a> know, with the water pipes underneath them, who knows if we're drinking lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4744.313s">It's</a> way past time, Mr. President, which, you know, we were told that bids would go out, they would be decided on in the best possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4754.315s">At</a> this point now, my understanding is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4756.735s">None</a> of these bids were decided on, which brought to me to go out, you know, after being told one thing, to go out and get these signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4763.939s">In</a> relation to other things like, which I'm 100% for, park improvement and bringing things in there, we need to fix what we, I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4775.466s">I</a> think maybe a tandem project could be done to do it, but, you know, if you go out and you fix the parks, it, quite frankly, it's putting lipstick on a pig, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4787.172s">It's</a> more than just the infrastructure work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4793.663s">I</a> took my first steps of my life on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4796.888s">We</a> have residents on that street right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4799.358s">diagnosed</a> with cancer who will be dead, at least one, within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4803.982s">We</a> need people taking our first and our last steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4807.304s">This</a> is our home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4809.766s">Our</a> excise taxes, our sales taxes, our property taxes, our surcharges on these taxes go towards keeping our home, our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4819.673s">We</a> come home after a hard day of work to see potholes as big as the mouths of an alligator with rocks all over the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4827.179s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4828.881s">You</a> wonder why that sometimes, you know, people... <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4834.019s">I</a> don't want to say it's a direct correlation, but it doesn't help when there's an opioid and a drinking problem to come home after a hard day's work and see our existence in total shambles, with streets falling apart and sidewalks falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4850.224s">It</a> doesn't help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4850.784s">These</a> things are related. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4852.384s">Not</a> a direct cause and effect, but it is related. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4858.286s">It's</a> more than just the infrastructure projects that are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4862.547s">And</a> when we pay all this to actually see government governing over the will of the people, we can't wrap our minds around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4870.652s">You</a> should have heard some of the comments I heard coming down the street, my neighbor across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4875.822s">Her</a> SUV two years ago sank in the sewer draining because the street around it fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4883.647s">And</a> she had to call AAA to get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4885.808s">Mrs.</a> Natola told me a bunch of years back, a whole chasm opened up on Evans Street, and a whole truck fell into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4893.732s">And</a> that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4894.593s">It's</a> wear and tear on our police vehicles, and our fire engines, and other infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4902.377s">plowing</a> trucks and everything else that we're also paying for as taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4908.101s">I</a> mean, it's at a critical point, and I want to thank this council for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4914.464s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Reed and Mr. Penter, who spoke before, and I hope that something can be done expediently, because we're tired of paying to be told something and then not having it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4929.889s">It's</a> beyond comprehension. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4931.61s">It's</a> beyond incompetence. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4933.65s">And</a> it's an affront to people that have lived on these city streets in their whole lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4944.134s">I</a> mean, with kids playing there, with their pets and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4946.855s">Mr.</a> President, please use the power of this body to <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4952.125s">inspire</a> this mayor to do what we all know has to be done, or do something when the budget comes up, to jar the system and make it work for the people that you represent, who voted for you, who put you on this august body, as Mr. Penta likes to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4970.237s">I</a> think another member of the community wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4974.878s">And</a> I hope that, you know, I get a little passionate, but I'm not speaking up here just for myself, speaking on these for these other 50 people and all around the city of Medford to people who who don't have the time to come out to this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4989.662s">I'm</a> fortunate to have the time, and I'm trying to articulate their passion and, quite frankly, their rage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4997.504s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6813.174s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6814.614s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6818.008s">I</a> want to thank all the people that came out and spoke tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6821.609s">I</a> would hope that, you know, with this audience and focus on this issue, I would hope that more residents in the auditorium tonight and watching at home would pay a lot more attention to what goes on in the city of Medford on their website, because this is one in a sea of issues that escapes a lot of people in their everyday lives, that if more people came out and spoke like this so eloquently, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6847.871s">as</a> have tonight that came before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6851.232s">A</a> lot more good government and a lot more good stewardship of the people's money would take place in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6857.993s">I</a> just want to address three quick points. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6860.394s">Communication,</a> affordable housing, and money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6865.015s">On</a> communication, obviously, this Zoning Board of Appeals seriously dropped the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6870.756s">I</a> mean, if they took into account the full city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6874.142s">in</a> the streets and roads, the police department falling apart, the school facade, this building right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6880.126s">There</a> are a lot more serious issues to address first before we bring in a 490 unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6886.43s">I</a> mean, my street alone, I just found out tonight that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6891.928s">I</a> came up before this council a few weeks ago that Evans Street is one of the top five streets, and Evans Street is a stone's throw from this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6901.17s">Now,</a> with this traffic that's gonna develop, you're gonna see more people trying to avoid the long lines and going down some of these other side streets like mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6910.132s">Now,</a> the Honorable Adam Knight sent me a message that bidding on my street ended, and they were gonna choose, but I come to find out, the meeting on Saturday morning, that nothing's moving forward on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6920.714s">There's</a> no plans to do any construction or fixing of that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6924.582s">The</a> water pipes in Medford, the gas pipes, there's a lot more serious issues to look at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6930.046s">before</a> the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6932.628s">And</a> I think Sheryl Rodriguez was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6934.729s">It</a> wasn't written by Medford for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6937.151s">It</a> was written by this body that wants to come in and make some change. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6941.374s">That's</a> first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6943.335s">Communication</a> is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6945.236s">It's</a> just that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6946.677s">The</a> second point is affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6949.099s">There's</a> other ways of making things affordable for the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6954.923s">Meals</a> tax, sales tax, income tax, property tax, that goes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6959.366s">Next</a> month starts the Community Preservation Act, which is an end-run to around the property two and a half tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6965.269s">That's</a> a surcharge on the property taxes that have gone up for every year for nearly 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6970.331s">Reduce</a> some of these taxes, make it more affordable for the citizens of Medford, people to want to move here, businesses to want to move here through tax incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6980.535s">With</a> more people moving in, you'll find that the city will actually have reduced tax rates, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6984.757s">would</a> probably take in more revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6986.917s">That's</a> number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6988.618s">Number</a> three is money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6990.158s">You're</a> talking about hiring a lawyer if this resolution is passed and the cost that's going to be on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6998.36s">What</a> cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=6999.0s">You're</a> having a free cash account, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7001.3s">A</a> surplus of almost $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7003.561s">How</a> many millions in surplus is this city sitting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7007.142s">This</a> is our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7008.122s">We've</a> already paid for the lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7010.802s">Their</a> money has already been given to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7013.323s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7016.463s">And</a> finally, one last question through the chair for the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7019.904s">If</a> this board does vote to pass a resolution to appeal, then the mayor has to approve it or is she automatically bound by the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7032.406s">The</a> president is shaking his head no. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7035.607s">So</a> what you're saying is this city council could pass a resolution and the mayor could possibly shoot it down and the appeal is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7043.092s">Is</a> that what you're telling me, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7046.553s">I</a> wouldn't use those words, but yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7051.795s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7052.595s">I'm</a> sure you would use much more congenial words, and I appreciate your candor and good judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7058.697s">I</a> hope that if that does become the situation, and it does get dismissed, not approved, kindly disregarded by Her Honor the Mayor, then when you come to a city budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7073.213s">You</a> should actually use the power of the city council to have some bite, to speak up for these people that are in this audience tonight that want action for their money and their votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=7082.991s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11073.433s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11074.513s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11076.554s">I'll</a> try to be very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11078.995s">It</a> seems to me like there's some confusion as to whether or not, I mean, you're talking about the process and I appreciate that, but I mean, everything that was discussed tonight, you've got the 11 variances, the zoning particular to this case impact on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11095.481s">It</a> seems to me you've got, like right now, you could make a motion to appeal, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11102.482s">enlist</a> specific things, specific to this zoning law, as the city solicitor informed us that it has to be specific to this zoning, to take a vote on appeal and request the funds from the mayor for the legal representation for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11119.705s">I</a> don't see why that's not crystal clear to everybody in this room at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11126.626s">And</a> I would just like to ask, when you do take the vote to appeal and it gets approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11131.833s">that</a> whatever meetings that you do have with legal representation, that it's open to the public, specifically to the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11140.376s">Because</a> like Gene Martin said earlier, these are people that, you know, this is everyday, ordinary people that may not be lawyers, that may not be pretty about how to go about appealing this as a direct abutter to this, so that they could come, not to piggyback on your litigation process, but so that they can absorb information as well <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11161.152s">so</a> that they know what to do going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11163.473s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks/2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 7, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5185.165s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5186.325s">I'm</a> Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street, which is not a direct abutter, but very close proximity to this massive project that's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5196.429s">And,</a> you know, there's not too much more to add to the conversation except to touch upon the infrastructure problems that the city already has. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5208.673s">I</a> mean, here in this building, the high school, the police department, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5215.178s">I</a> was up here last week talking about Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5220.62s">We're</a> not against the development, but something this big, I definitely agree with Councilors Knight and Falco, that this is just something that seems to be too big, and it seems to be coming in with the impression I'm getting, with a lot of expediency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5234.847s">I</a> mean, actually being told, the citizens, by this developer, it's coming, deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5240.229s">That's</a> unprecedented. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5241.67s">I</a> want to thank all the other speakers that spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5244.993s">When</a> this traffic impact happens, you know, and it gets clogged on Fellsway and Riverside Ave, these folks are going to be looking for, you know, quick shortcuts to get back to their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5257.342s">They're</a> going to be going down Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5259.043s">That's</a> not fixed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5260.664s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for informing me that the bids are in to replace the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5266.368s">And</a> once those bids seep through and one is decided on, they're going to come in and fix Evans Street, which is in the top five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5274.409s">of</a> streets that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5276.25s">But</a> there's probably a hundred or more streets that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5280.132s">And</a> what happens when this added traffic is on the roads when Evans Street is shut down for, who knows, a month for fixing? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5288.897s">And</a> other streets are too. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5291.319s">It</a> seems to me that we don't want to discourage development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5297.822s">But</a> at the same time, we got to fix what we got first. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5300.624s">We</a> can't build on a faulty foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5303.426s">Our</a> streets and roads, our water pipes, the parks are being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5308.01s">I</a> mean, this location seems to me a good location to put a joint police and fire station instead of this massive project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5318.538s">It</a> just seems to me that there are other things to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5321.17s">in</a> this city first that need almost at a critical level of attention before we start entertaining massive, massive projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5331.758s">I</a> mean, there's a public safety issue too with all these cars going down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5335.38s">I</a> mean, in my neighborhood, there's at least 20 young kids that live on that street that are all over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5342.125s">If</a> they can navigate through all the rocks on Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5346.238s">Sorry</a> for the jab on that one again, but still, I mean, in all of these neighborhoods with more cards on there, the safety risk goes up, and if it goes up even 1%, that's, I'm sorry, that's too much for my liking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5361.384s">I</a> really don't understand how this city council doesn't have jurisdiction over the appeal or whoever's approving this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5371.467s">It</a> would seem that you must have something in the books <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5374.465s">put</a> some kind of injunction. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5376.186s">And</a> that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5378.007s">Why</a> doesn't this body communicate with the DPW or with the police station or with other things to find out, you know, there's a lot of infrastructure problems in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5387.974s">You</a> know, let's talk about this impact on the city and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5393.938s">Why</a> don't we get together and maybe not <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5396.517s">approve</a> this, especially in the manner with which they're keeping people in a dark room on a hot night and giving them three minutes to speak, and then they're being told. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5406.365s">One</a> of the speakers that spoke earlier that called everybody to a public action, I can't emphasize and ditto her and echo her more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5416.012s">That's</a> what we need, not for just this issue, but I would love to see more people at this podium and in these chambers every week <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5425.248s">because</a> when more voices are heard from all different parts of this city, more projects will have a fire lit under them, and more things will get done for the benefit of all of us, everybody on the city council, the administration, all the small businesses, and all the taxpayers, and all the residents, the kids in the schools, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5447.74s">Politics</a> is really not a spectator sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=5450.241s">But</a> I hope you consider all the things everybody said tonight, and I thank you for your time.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10376.024s">Thank</a> you, President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10377.904s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10382.492s">I</a> have to say really briefly, I really enjoy saying President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10387.816s">That</a> would be a great thing for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10390.838s">But</a> I digress. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10392.419s">Is</a> this matter going to be tabled? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10398.503s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10399.304s">I</a> believe we're going to have that offering, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10401.525s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10402.426s">I</a> mean, all through this discussion, a couple of things came to my mind that Ronald Reagan often said. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10412.31s">as</a> scary as nine words, I'm here from the government and I'm here to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10416.293s">And</a> the government that governs least is the government that governs best. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10420.937s">President</a> Lungo-Koehn, what Councilor Marks said tonight was 1,000% spot on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10429.083s">I</a> think the vote should be taken and this should be voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10435.988s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10439.41s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10439.651s">Hunt</a> said to <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10442.088s">Councilor</a> Caraviello that she wouldn't want to have a public hearing on a theoretical proposition, but they want to have the vote tonight on a solid proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10456.316s">So</a> I don't understand how it changes from a solid proposal to the city council to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10462.878s">to</a> a theoretical proposition to the citizens that are suffering, do as I say, not as I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10469.923s">I'm</a> really confused on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10472.405s">How</a> is that possible, that for the residents, it's a theoretical proposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10478.108s">But</a> there's an ironclad proposal here tonight that's going to bind the residents of Medford Inn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10484.713s">That's</a> why I asked President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10488.049s">this</a> was going to be tabled, because if it's going to be tabled, then my point is moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10494.634s">But</a> I really think this should be voted down, unless the city's going to get in on it, too, like Councilor Marks said. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10506.463s">But</a> I think the residents of this city need to have 1,000 questions, all sorts of input. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10518.288s">since,</a> you know, they're being basically forced into something. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10524.209s">Thank</a> you, President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA/2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 31, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=792.766s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=793.626s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=795.426s">Robert</a> Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=798.248s">So,</a> I mean, just a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=800.329s">When</a> you say that Lauren did her job, there have been, going back a couple years now, reports to the city about this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=813.174s">It</a> spills out into Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=816.035s">These</a> rocks are in front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=818.796s">They're</a> on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=822.898s">My</a> question, I guess, is will we get a time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=828.173s">of</a> when this will be done, because it is the summertime now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=832.275s">Kids</a> are out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=833.516s">They're</a> going to be all over that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=835.417s">It's</a> only a matter of time before a tire spins one of these up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=839.379s">I</a> mean, we've already had injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=842.16s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, is there any way we can get some type of time frame on when to expect this street to be fixed?
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=867.601s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=879.269s">When</a> we consider the surplus amounts in city coffers and you know, we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=884.857s">an</a> endless list of taxes to be paid, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=888.3s">And</a> no disrespect to this body, but this is—it's an abomination. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=895.726s">It</a> really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=896.466s">And</a> the amount of money that we pay as residents and taxpayers, that this wasn't done two years ago when you were first informed of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=906.274s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1103.73s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1105.191s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1107.732s">Maybe</a> if they could come by and pick up all these loose rocks that are, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1113.175s">But</a> if this gets added to the mayor's capital plan, what does that do in terms of a timeframe of fixing this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1120.578s">I</a> mean, when do they meet on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1121.959s">When</a> is that discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1123.32s">When</a> is that approved?
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1178.593s">So</a> then my next question would be, knowing this, why would a councillor request to put this on the capital plan that's going to push it out another year or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1188.458s">It's</a> unprecedented.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4189.003s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4190.304s">Robert</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4194.047s">Just</a> to address some of the things that were talked about here, I don't think Mr. Reid was coming up here to try to be accusatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4201.813s">I</a> just think he was asking for accountability and transparency on issues that have been going on in the city of Medford for years, if not decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4212.281s">When</a> I ran for this body in 2013, my main issue was the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4217.923s">You're</a> asking the citizens of Medford to pay for the rainwater in the snow melt. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4223.107s">You</a> add that to the meals tax, the sales tax, the property tax, which is about to have a surcharge put on it, and we want answers as to why things are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4232.895s">The</a> Honorable Mike Marks asks, well, where do you think that the lack of communication came? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4238.96s">Well,</a> you heard my neighbor and friend earlier tonight say four recent <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4245.878s">additions</a> to C-Click Fix were taken down today as resolved, and obviously they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4251.819s">Those</a> pictures I took were yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4253.78s">This</a> gentleman is talking about a state allocation of $4 million that we could be using on top of what is in the excess of the water account now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4263.942s">It's</a> like $7 million or something like that was the last report I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4268.523s">Now</a> we're talking about $10 or $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4272.453s">It</a> doesn't need to be discussed or pushed forward anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4276.255s">It's</a> not just Devon Street, it's also Pinkard Street around the corner from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4281.878s">In</a> working on several campaigns that I've worked on and ballot initiatives, walking around the city through the Heights, through South Medford, it's literally the whole city, with some streets being at an emergency condition, with matters of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4299.253s">we're</a> asking questions about all the tax dollars that we pay and the fees that we pay, the parking meters, people paying after six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4307.68s">I</a> mean, where is all this money going? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4311.183s">I</a> think it's not being done because it looks great sitting in the accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4316.267s">And</a> then Medford elected public servants can go around and say, well, Moody's just upgraded our credit rating to AAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4326.476s">And</a> yeah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4329.08s">on</a> paper, but when you look through and walk through the city and you're wondering why communications are going ignored from people who work for the city, and you ask a question, it's like, where's the problems and where's the miscommunications? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.047s">It's</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.908s">And</a> we're just asking for the work to be done that has been years in dire need of it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4353.913s">You</a> got the budget next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4355.734s">I</a> hope a lot of people will come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4358.39s">and</a> ask questions and hold you folks accountable and transparent to the citizens that are paying for all of this, that are not getting anything back when Dr. Stirello talked about the police department deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4374.685s">I</a> hope people will come tomorrow night to the town hall that the chief will have at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4382.388s">and</a> ask questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4383.768s">But</a> I know you sigh, and I'm talking, and I'm taking too much time, President Dello Russo, but these are very important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4391.69s">It's</a> a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4392.91s">It's</a> a matter of work not getting done with all of the money sitting there when petitions are being ignored for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4400.931s">I'm</a> sorry, but it's really at the brink, and this body really needs to come together and do something to light a fire under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4409.533s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4995.918s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4997.238s">Rob</a> Capucci again, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4999.719s">There's</a> another issue going on at Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5001.96s">I'm</a> not sure or not if it's supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5004.661s">I</a> believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5005.885s">But</a> these machines are supposed to shut down at 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5008.847s">They're</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5010.468s">In</a> the last month and a half, just walking through the city, I told a good dozen people, just tonight, I went to the store before coming here, and at 6.40, there was a young lady starting to feed money into the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5022.657s">And</a> I said, no, you don't have to pay right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5025.039s">It's</a> 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5026.24s">And</a> she said, well, I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5028.121s">And</a> I said, well, it's on the parking sign, but it's written very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5031.744s">She</a> said, well, it would have been a little bit more helpful if it was actually on the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5035.428s">itself,</a> that it closes at 6 o'clock.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5041.651s">You</a> cannot put any more money in.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5051.255s">Are</a> you absolutely sure of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5052.475s">Because</a> I've seen people feed <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5058.263s">If</a> there's a way to request receipts and to look at that, because, I mean, you're putting in your personal information. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5067.065s">If</a> people are paying after 6 o'clock, and, I mean, as Councilor Marks alluded to, they're trying to generate revenues, I wouldn't be surprised a bit if some of these machines are taking money after 6 o'clock, just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5081.928s">But</a> I would look into their receipts, see if they are or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5086.029s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7139.231s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7140.251s">Rob</a> Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7145.593s">I</a> know you've already had the discussion about Evans Street and you've taken action on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7151.835s">But</a> it looks like now you're, it's like piecemealing something when, you know, stepping outside of the box and look it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7161.078s">I</a> think what a lot of people in Medford see is, like Mr. Reed spoke of before, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7166.259s">You</a> have allocation of funds on the MWRA for, I believe you talked about sidewalks or something like $3 million, which 75% of which would be grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7178.164s">We</a> see in the free cash account, something like six or $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7185.507s">What</a> we don't understand as citizens paying all these taxes is how come it can't be that this commissioner's office can't be staffed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7196.027s">with</a> the right amount of people to survey the city, make the proper assessments, hire the people that we need, and get the job done when there's all this money that's at your fingertips to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7210.902s">We're</a> talking about $500,000 that we don't even know what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7214.826s">We're</a> talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7217.225s">complaints</a> and registers made to SeeClickFix that are taken down and closed and resolved when they're obviously not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7226.43s">It's</a> just a hard thing to wrap your mind around, seeing almost tens of millions of dollars, when an understaffed department that doesn't even have the manpower to go out there and assess what needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7241.299s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President, but it has to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7244.6s">Leadership</a> has to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7245.98s">It</a> has to be accountable and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7248.261s">It</a> has to look at what we've got in order to fund the resources to get these jobs done that are years past due. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7260.023s">It's</a> something to consider when you look at the budget next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7264.624s">I</a> would like to say this, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7268.385s">The</a> parks project that has gone on, because a lot of hits and a lot of criticism has been made, I've got to give kudos to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7278.708s">You've</a> got to also reward what's good as being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7282.589s">And</a> Morrison Parks, our new basketball court and a few of the other parks, excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7288.43s">Excellent</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7289.271s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3723.966s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3725.187s">I'm</a> Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3729.548s">Let</a> me start with the city is being denied a service that we're paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3735.673s">The</a> last figure I heard is somewhere around half a million dollars from our Verizon and cable bill is going towards public access that's been shut off since, I believe, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3748.36s">That's</a> years of a disservice to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3753.463s">So</a> on Friday, I actually took a day off from work and I drove around to Melrose Community Public Access Station, SCAT TV in Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3764.25s">and</a> Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3766.752s">Just</a> to give an idea of what we're being denied here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3770.554s">First</a> of all, jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3772.575s">Somerville</a> employs eight people full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3775.877s">Malden,</a> I found out from one of the station managers that I visited, employs nine people full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3782.521s">Melrose</a> has three people full-time with three part-timers, and I think it's the same in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3788.104s">That's</a> jobs being denied to Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3791.286s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3793.237s">The</a> programming that's on some of these stations is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3799.54s">Self-help</a> programs, community awareness programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3804.541s">I</a> think of some of the organizations here in Medford, like the Medford Community Coalition or Prominent Citizens that were just honored a few weeks ago, Jay Campbell, the fine things these folks do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3817.906s">With</a> a public access TV show, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3820.63s">it</a> could be compounded and bring more great services to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3825.813s">I</a> mean, you all know I'm a political activist, so my forte is, you know, we're in a big election year here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3832.215s">Candidates,</a> next year's a municipal election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3835.537s">Candidates</a> could have a forum, another avenue to bring their campaign and talk about different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3843.42s">You</a> know, I think about in 2015, some 2,500 people blanked <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3849.393s">the</a> ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3851.816s">It</a> might not have been so many if we had, you know, a public access TV show where we could discuss the pros and cons of the ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3863.369s">Other</a> things, too, that could happen, the Honorable Breanna Lungo-Koehn talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3870.825s">communications</a> from the police in terms of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3875.607s">He</a> could have a show on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3877.548s">You</a> can talk about different neighborhoods in Medford that might be having problems or might need more attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3886.253s">Boards</a> and planning meetings that happen in this building could find a show from somebody who wishes to produce a show on things like that and bring more information <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3898.672s">which</a> is power and knowledge to the taxpayers of this city that deserve public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3906.156s">Now,</a> in talking with other station managers and the wonderful things that they're doing, at least one of them, the station manager at Somerville, knew a little bit about what we have here in Medford, the equipment, and they offered, you know, they said if I'm successful in bringing a positive message and do get the ball rolling, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3927.316s">They're</a> going to reach out, and they're going to help us get us up on our feet and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3931.198s">I'm</a> sure there's a lot of other residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3934.04s">The</a> students, they have great teaching going on at Medford High School, but having our own public access, this could be almost like an internship for them to get real world experience to move on to whatever college and future careers they might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3952.049s">In</a> closing, I just want to say that I <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3956.063s">I</a> hope that the mayor's office is watching this because I believe ultimately it resides in the mayor's office to get this back up and running or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3964.469s">But</a> if there's any kind of vote or any influence that you find city councilors can have on the mayor's office to get this going, it would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3974.737s">I</a> mean, in terms of helping this city, there's so many things a public access station can do for children, for working families, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3985.865s">and</a> for our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3987.525s">So</a> I hope you take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3989.626s">Thank</a> you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3990.666s">Thank</a> you very much.

href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8868.021s">I</a> have been working on another project, and a week ago from Saturday, I started at the end of Salem Street, where it intersects with the Fellsway, before Malden, and I stalked at Forest Street, just taking pictures of businesses that were once there that are gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8883.654s">I</a> have pictures of over 20 businesses in that eight block radius that are gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8889.935s">I'm</a> not blaming that on the pay-to-park kiosk program, but with all due respect, we're talking about being realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8897.458s">The</a> small businesses in this community that provide the jobs and this city makes money off of through sales tax and mails tax and whatnot are the reasons why, partly, we have a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8911.322s">And</a> if we focused, you know, hindsight's 20-20, but if we focused years ago on <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8919.823s">going</a> to bat in supporting small businesses, and we didn't lose these 20 businesses, we would have had the funding for Chief Sacco to have a full and adequate police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8932.812s">I</a> mean, God bless him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8933.612s">He's</a> doing the best he can with the manpower he has. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8937.195s">And</a> with the national feeling going on about police officers in general in the country, he deserves a real <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8945.653s">applaud</a> him and every officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8947.834s">But</a> if we had the full and adequate police force built upon providing the support that we can to these small businesses going back years ago, it's not that the business owners are parking in front of their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8965.821s">The</a> problem was in the past was that because Chief Sacco doesn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8970.065s">an</a> adequate police force to enforce the laws that are already on the books for traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8976.366s">We</a> have people from other cities and towns coming here, parking all day right in front of these businesses, and then getting on the T and going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8984.008s">That</a> was the real problem, not the business owners parking in front of their places of establishment all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8993.17s">The</a> gentleman who owns the gas station right across from the West Medford post office, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9000.373s">A</a> few weeks ago, I was talking to him and he said, you come out here at 11 o'clock in the morning and you look up this street that was once parked with cars and all these small businesses were making money off, it's gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9012.581s">We're</a> losing money, businesses, jobs, revenues being collected because of this pay to park kiosk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9021.566s">And</a> I hope that the next mayoral administration will exercise the buyout option and get rid of it <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9028.233s">provide</a> the infrastructure and support for small businesses to take the place of these 20 businesses that are on this phone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9034.223s">I'll</a> email you the pictures if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9036.847s">And</a> we have that level of economic engine activity again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9043.39s">And</a> with the two surpluses we have, with all that money coming in, we can hire a full police force for Chief Sackle to get the officers out there, not even to mention all the construction programs that are going on, to have Chief Sackle with a full police force to implement the traffic laws that are already on hand, then we wouldn't be experiencing a lot of these problems, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9064.959s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8052.092s">I</a> wasn't aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8053.292s">I</a> just hope more arrests are being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8056.313s">And</a> thank you for informing me on that, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8059.373s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8059.934s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8061.174s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8061.834s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, sir.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1121.111s">Well,</a> if I may, I specifically returned to this podium and I asked the direct question, does this amendment mean, at the time, the MWRA wanted to raise our rates by 10%, but then after this whole debate and passing of the amendment for the $600,000 to come out, I returned and I asked specifically, and I believe it was the Honorable Michael Marks who said the answer to my question, which was, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1149.427s">Does</a> this mean that nobody in Medford will see a water rate increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1153.069s">And</a> the answer was directly given to me, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1156.431s">Now</a> you're saying that under this tiered rate, some people are actually and some businesses are actually going to see somewhat of an increase?

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8829.772s">The</a> matter is disposed of, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8832.695s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8834.776s">Robert</a> Capucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8838.379s">I</a> didn't plan on speaking on this tonight, but a couple of points came up that I had to voice my concern about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8844.722s">With</a> all due respect to the Chief of Police, who has been exhaustive in his energies on this kiosk program, he referred to concerns that people have and the questions that are coming up as throwing stones <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8859.89s">on</a> something that we haven't even seen if it works yet, when on a issue brought up tonight by Councilor Penter, it clearly states, Medford citizenry never had an open public opportunity for input, discussions, concerns of the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8877.159s">Is</a> it throwing stones? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8879.14s">And</a> with all due respect, I have great respect for the Chief of Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8883.743s">I</a> just wish he would term it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8885.664s">Was</a> it throwing stones for Jimmy's pizza? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8888.37s">To</a> come up here and address his concerns, was it throwing stones for the woman who talked about Playstead Road and what she has to do to get a permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8898.173s">Was</a> it throwing stones for the guy who owns the lock company? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8901.374s">Was</a> it throwing stones for all the other citizens and businesses that have come up here? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8906.536s">And</a> my second point is on the 30-minute parking amendment, a query posed by the Honourable Michael Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8917.2s">That's</a> never going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8918.384s">because</a> that will get rid of all the money these folks are going to be collecting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8924.73s">I</a> have seen for the last few weeks, going into months now, the great concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8931.636s">I</a> mean, we're talking about making Medford more business friendly and improving our five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8937.541s">Welcome</a> to Medford with higher property tax rates, pay to park, the streets falling apart, an understaffed police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8944.487s">I</a> mean, there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8945.802s">a</a> lot more things this city could be doing and it's ultimately going to depend on the voters this year and to exercise that option in this contract to buy it out and get rid of it, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8959.59s">It</a> would be the best thing for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8962.572s">Thank</a> you for your time.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2698.876s">Okay,</a> two points, Councilor Penta, excuse me, Councilor Camuso to Councilor Knight through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2707.258s">We've</a> just had eight years of the Patrick administration who has already cut aid to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2713.18s">this</a> city was still able to create the $7 million surplus under that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2719.066s">Governor</a> Patrick has repeatedly blamed the federal government for his having to cut aid to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2727.453s">Another</a> point I would like to make is, what was the other part of what you said?
 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2737.977s">The</a> citizens of Medford who are paying these taxes, we'd like to have some rainy day funds in our pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2745.182s">And</a> if taking a million dollars out of a $7 million surplus is going to allow, I mean, I don't see the city of Medford having bake sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2754.127s">I</a> don't see the city of Medford manufacturing products and selling them to the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2758.71s">Government</a> doesn't make <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2760.327s">any</a> money at all until it levies a tax on the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2764.971s">We</a> want to make Medford an attractive and popular town. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2768.435s">We</a> do that by cutting tax rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2771.457s">I</a> don't think there should be a property tax increase on the residential properties or the commercial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2778.103s">We</a> gotta make Medford attractive because Somerville has taken off ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2782.888s">And</a> as far as alluding to those four votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2786.651s">that</a> come up, this city's constantly being told, next time for the police station, next time for the dark park. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2794.217s">Well,</a> next time is now, and we do have city elections coming up next year, and I hope everybody within the sound of my voice hears it, because we need that fourth vote here on the council, or we need a new administration in the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2808.689s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Robert Cappucci]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3848.205s">Robert</a> Capucci from 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3850.486s">First</a> and foremost, Councilor Penta, thank you for your eloquence, your wisdom, and your passion in sticking up for the fundamental American individualism. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3860.911s">That</a> is the whole reason why I brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3862.992s">I</a> didn't know myself the extent of reach into children three to 12 years old that this Agenda 21 has. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3871.015s">Agenda</a> 21, make no mistake, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3875.457s">is</a> about the redistribution of wealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3878.158s">The</a> United Nations charter calls for taking a back seat to individual freedoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3888.64s">The</a> director of ICLEI, a guy named Dr. Harris, I believe his name is, states right out that individualism <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3897.858s">has</a> to take a back seat towards the redistribution of wealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3903.402s">They</a> blame the United States, as Councilor Penta said, for the problems environmentally of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3911.989s">So</a> what they do, and what socialism does itself, is it doesn't raise the lower up to the higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3919.895s">What</a> it actually does is lowers the higher <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3924.078s">down</a> and that doesn't help anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3926.479s">Now,</a> Councilor Dello Russo, I'm sure that high school you visited did have individuals that were very bright and smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3933.823s">That's,</a> that's not the point of argument here. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3936.865s">And</a> you also brought up, uh, Joe McCarthy, McCarthyism and you, and it, and it kinda, it kinda puts this whole question that Councilor pent is bringing up that I, I tried to enlighten the city and the citizens to in a light as a certain, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3951.325s">form</a> of, oh, it's crazy wackoism to talk about something like this happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3957.047s">But</a> it is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3958.288s">And</a> communities all over this nation have gotten rid of ICLEI and Agenda 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3963.53s">The</a> town of Cuyver Mass, Las Cruces, New Mexico, towns all over the United States are getting rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3972.293s">Sir?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3973.728s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo, Joe McCarthy brought up an issue in the 50s stating there were 53 communists in the United States government. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3982.553s">And</a> he was ridiculed for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3984.675s">He</a> was dogged. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3985.755s">He</a> was called an idiot. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3987.156s">He</a> eventually left the Senate, became an alcoholic, and died young. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3992.159s">Did</a> you know that in 1995, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3995.258s">the</a> government of Russia put out something called the Venona Papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4000.742s">And</a> in those Venona Papers, it proved everything Joe McCarthy was saying as accurate to a T. There were 53 communists in the United States government. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4012.932s">This</a> is a real issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4014.273s">It's</a> nothing crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4015.894s">It's</a> something very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4018.857s">I</a> passed out that pamphlet. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4021.08s">to</a> you folks when I gave my presentation on the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4024.461s">On</a> the bottom, it had a website for a quick 12-minute video. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4029.343s">I</a> watched it before I came here tonight, and it's from 629 to 641. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4035.385s">Did</a> all you folks watch that? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4037.066s">I</a> certainly hope you did, because there were resources in there to look up <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4042.668s">All</a> sorts of other things about Agenda 21, and Councilor Penta brought up a lot of things I didn't know myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4049.713s">An</a> environmental officer from the western part of Massachusetts first introduced me to Agenda 21, ICLEI and sustainable development. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4058.198s">He's</a> a conservationist officer for Massachusetts, and he's been going around this state giving a two-hour presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4069.263s">on</a> the true nature behind Agenda 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4073.106s">And</a> it is an indoctrination of our youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4076.129s">It</a> is teaching kids <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4077.975s">away</a> from individualism and the foundations of the United States Constitution towards the UN Charter and the UN Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4087.078s">And</a> it's really a shame if that's happening because I'm 41 and when I'm 55, I don't want to see the United States of America where a 20-year-old <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4101.323s">Kids</a> that are now stepping up to your positions, having their idea that it's not about the free individual American citizen, but it's about the big bad America and its corporate greed and how they have to be punished and their wealth has to be redistributed to other countries around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4119.213s">American</a> excellence and American individualism must be fought for. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4123.055s">And</a> it's great that Councilor Penta brought this up, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4128.1s">The</a> way he argued the point was flawless. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4130.783s">It</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4131.704s">And</a> I highly discount, uh, the Councilors for his interruption and for trying to highlight it as McCarthyism and crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4139.972s">When,</a> when please look up the Venona papers, counsel Dello Russo, Joe McCarthy was proved right. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4145.036s">Thank</a> you very much.
