    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=770.516s">[Caraviello]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=771.417s">[Caraviello]</a>: Um, I want to commend, uh, my council Marks on, uh, on his motion here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=776.519s">[Caraviello]</a>: Um, I'd like to see that the city look into possibly buying a machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=780.941s">[Caraviello]</a>: Uh, I mean, all they are is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=783.863s">[Caraviello]</a>: And if there are grants available, why can't we buy our own machine so we don't have to keep going and looking for one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=791.165s">[Caraviello]</a>: And also, Mr. President, I'd like to send a letter to the mayor asking him to ask the sheriff if he could come down with the graffiti team and maybe clean up some of the stuff that's down here now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=805.229s">[Caraviello]</a>: I don't know if that's already been asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=808.53s">[Caraviello]</a>: Because as I say, there is, like on Harvard Street, I know the T's already cleaned it a couple of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=812.512s">[Caraviello]</a>: And if you get on Forest Street, there's a couple of, there's the big old building, it's been tagged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=819.876s">[Caraviello]</a>: It is an eyesore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=822.638s">[Caraviello]</a>: There's been some tagging on the side of that sound wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=827.4s">[Caraviello]</a>: As I say, if the Sheriff's Department could come down and help us out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=829.902s">[Caraviello]</a>: But again, if there is some grant money, why can't we buy our own power washer, high end power washer to do that ourselves rather than hiring a company to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1027.74s">[Caraviello]</a>: Chair recognizes Vice President Caravaglio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1029.901s">[Caraviello]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1030.741s">[Caraviello]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1033.401s">[Caraviello]</a>: At the meeting, the chief talked about see something, say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1037.438s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, you know, some of these tags, I mean, they're not like one minute tags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1041.72s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, if you're going to Harvest Street, that had to take a half an hour to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1045.162s">[Caraviello]</a>: Someone had to be driving by and seeing this and not say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1047.944s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, on Forest Street, they climbed up to the third floor of the back of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1052.346s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, so I mean, it isn't that, you know, you're spraying something and you're running away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1056.248s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, if someone had to see things during this time, again, if you see something, say something, call the police so they can get caught in the act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1874.808s">[Caraviello]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1876.868s">[Caraviello]</a>: I echo some of Councilor Pinto's concerns here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1880.409s">[Caraviello]</a>: Last week, after the meeting, the next day on Councilor Longo's motion on the cameras, I received a call from a gentleman from Medford, who that's what they do, about cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1891.211s">[Caraviello]</a>: And he'd be willing to come down to meet with the chief<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1894.565s">[Caraviello]</a>: He said the cost of the camera is approximately $5,000 per camera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1899.486s">[Caraviello]</a>: And this company does multiple cities and towns police forces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1904.367s">[Caraviello]</a>: So I told the chief I would refer the number over to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1909.468s">[Caraviello]</a>: At the meeting that we were at at the police station, I did ask the chief about using retired policemen to man details and do other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1917.289s">[Caraviello]</a>: And the chief was steadfast against that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1921.03s">[Caraviello]</a>: He said he had safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1923.206s">[Caraviello]</a>: liability concerns about using recently retired policemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1926.808s">[Caraviello]</a>: And my point was, many details go unmet because you can't find anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1934.392s">[Caraviello]</a>: Why couldn't you use somebody that's recently retired to come on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1936.894s">[Caraviello]</a>: But he didn't want to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1941.556s">[Caraviello]</a>: One last thing, talking about the parking, one of the things I would like to see in here was maybe some type of a one-ticket amnesty program for people who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1952.074s">[Caraviello]</a>: just made a mistake or whatever, for whatever reason, for maybe the first 30 days to maybe help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1961.037s">[Caraviello]</a>: And I'm going to reiterate again what I said on our first meeting in the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1965.018s">[Caraviello]</a>: If this is going to generate $18 to $20 million, I'd like to see all the money generated go toward the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1971.401s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, if we're going to go out and bond for that, let that $18 million pay for the bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1979.264s">[Caraviello]</a>: rather than put it into the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1983.386s">[Caraviello]</a>: I mean, if the numbers that they give are correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1988.468s">[Caraviello]</a>: So I don't know what my other counselors think about that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4726.955s">[Caraviello]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4728.096s">[Caraviello]</a>: The dog park that Councilor De La Rosa mentions, I was there with Maria Menounos when that opened with the grants from Purina Dog Food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4740.669s">[Caraviello]</a>: So there is somebody out there for those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7237.766s">[Caraviello]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7239.447s">[Caraviello]</a>: This afternoon, I, myself along with Chief Sacco, walked some of the streets in South Memphis today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7246.069s">[Caraviello]</a>: And Yale Street, right at the beginning, is, from all the trucks driving on the sidewalk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7253.413s">[Caraviello]</a>: It's all cracked and in deplorable condition, waiting for an accident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7258.097s">[Caraviello]</a>: And the same thing with the corner of Harvard and Main.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7260.659s">[Caraviello]</a>: And the truck's driving on top of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7262.901s">[Caraviello]</a>: All the sidewalk is cracked there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7264.382s">[Caraviello]</a>: And again, those are accidents waiting to happen, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7267.725s">[Caraviello]</a>: And one more spot, also in that same area, is the handicapped spot on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7275.391s">[Caraviello]</a>: A woman fell there not too long ago and broke her hip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7279.414s">[Caraviello]</a>: I happened to be there with a former firefighter, Raganoski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7283.092s">[Caraviello]</a>: And help the woman to the hospital.<br><br>
