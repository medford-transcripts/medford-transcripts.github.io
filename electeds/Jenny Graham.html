 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=915.061s">So</a> I did just want to say thank you to the MNA and the team that worked with us to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=921.409s">We</a> started meeting in maybe April or so, and it has been, you know, it's very difficult to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=929.599s">adjust</a> for schedules during the summertime and they rose to that challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=934.804s">So</a> I want to thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=937.247s">I</a> want to thank them for the discussion, particularly when we got to talk about things that didn't work in our school buildings and come up with better ways to make things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=948.137s">on</a> behalf of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=949.278s">So</a> I really applaud their hard work and their delivering for our students at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=955.482s">So</a> I really do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=958.444s">And</a> Mr. Carboneau is here with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=962.727s">He</a> is the bargaining liaison to the MNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=967.15s">And</a> if you, I didn't know if you would like to say something or just have us say thank you, but you're welcome to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=973.974s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.059s">You</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.939s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=979.8s">You're</a> good.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4878.8s">But</a> what is being relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4881.283s">I'm</a> not quite like, what is relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4884.145s">Is</a> it like a particular requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4887.647s">I'm</a> just trying to be very clear about what we're being asked to approve a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4892.03s">And</a> there's a lot of lore around how CCSR is funded, including I have been told by past people in the administration that we are required to pay stipends at certain levels to certain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4905.719s">I</a> don't know if that's true or if it's not true, but what I'm trying to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4910.442s">is</a> what are we required to do under the contract that we signed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4916.226s">What</a> are those features? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4918.348s">And</a> when we relaxed something, is it all of it or is it a specific thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4924.232s">So</a> I just want to be clear what we're saying because I don't want people to go out and be like, the school committee is gonna go spend this money on whatever they want because it was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4934.96s">I</a> just want to be very clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4938.342s">what</a> it is that was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4941.005s">Nothing</a> has been relaxed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4980.537s">Then</a> I would like to ask that we get an official correct <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4985.56s">letter</a> from the Cummings Foundation so that we can approve this in a way that is diligent with what they're asking us to do, especially if nothing has been relaxed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.367s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.907s">And</a> I think the other thing is to say, oh, this was in the grant 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5008.689s">I'm</a> sure that it was, but it's been 10 years and it would just also be helpful for people to say, here are the key features of the grant that was signed 10 years ago by nobody who's still in the building except for Mr. Trotta so that we can parse fact from fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5024.598s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5027.977s">Member</a> Rizzo.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5099.246s">Member</a> Intoppa, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5164.646s">And</a> I think getting to the bottom of those choices is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5169.59s">Yeah,</a> I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying that that's probably... Is there a motion to table this update, this request to approve the donation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5180.136s">Well,</a> we took it up on the agenda, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5182.657s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5185.099s">Motion</a> to table by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5186.539s">Is</a> there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5191.302s">Seconded</a> by Member Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5192.543s">Roll</a> call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5193.763s">Member</a> Branley.

href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5363.712s">I</a> am going to read this here with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5367.477s">I</a> think it's important if we're going to have a discussion about it that we all are on the same page about what is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5373.955s">member</a> public schools view certain technologies and integral part of the educational experience and is committed to providing a strong digital learning environment for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5381.663s">We</a> are dedicating, we are dedicated to providing all students with a 21st century education that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributors to a diverse and rapidly changing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5391.133s">The</a> MPS technology responsible use policy outlines the guidelines and behaviors that our users are expected to follow when using all technology, including AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5400.164s">MPS</a> supports the use of developmentally appropriate technology resources, including Gen AI, to improve teaching and learning for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5407.392s">MPS</a> recognizes that AI literacy includes understanding, evaluation, and use of appropriate Gen-AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5414.515s">These</a> skills are important for students and staff to participate effectively in technology-driven academic and work realities. <a

of Gen-AI tools across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5431.103s">Some</a> important definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5432.805s">Generative</a> Artificial Intelligence, also known as Gen AI, is the type of technology that generates content including images, text, video, audio, and other media when prompted by a user. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5443.418s">Generative</a> AI is a machine learning model that creates new content based on large amounts of training data in response to user prompts. <a

generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5467.687s">Guidelines</a> for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5469.288s">Our</a> Medford Public Schools AI guiding principles consider how the resource we use supports teaching and learning, addresses data privacy and security considerations, and supports ethical and responsible use of Gen AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5480.715s">In</a> addition to these considerations, students and staff must ensure critical evaluation of Gen-AI content to recognize biases and misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5490.338s">Guidance</a> for the student's default use of Gen AI tools in a given department shall be consistent across grade level and shall not infringe upon a teacher's discretion to allow or disallow their use for specific assignments or to provide learning supports or accommodations to students as designated by law and documented under a student's IEP 504 plan or other relevant provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5512.442s">All</a> Gen AI use must be linked to one or more specific educationally relevant objectives and shall not undermine the development of critical thinking skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5521.065s">When</a> responding to concerns about the use of Gen AI tools, MPS shall apply the same criteria used to review other instructional materials and access technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5528.867s">For</a> students, Gen-AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5531.369s">Any</a> Gen-AI tools being used must follow usage terms, e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5536.431s">age</a> restrictions, caregiver permission requirements, etc., and align with district student and data privacy and security requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5543.236s">Students</a> should not use any generative

schools are for educational purposes only. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5829.753s">For</a> district operations, Medford Public Schools recognize that Gen AI is increasingly embedded in the tools and systems that districts are used for budgeting, staffing, resource allocation, operational decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5841.076s">These</a> systems can help forecast trends, streamline processes, identify patterns and data, but may also reflect flawed assumptions, limit human discretion, and reinforce inequities in funding, hiring, or access to services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5851.858s">Medford</a> Public Schools commits to operational uses of Gen-AI with the same attention to ethical principles, communication equity, legality, as with instructional tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5860.382s">Specifically,</a> the use of Gen-AI tools for operational purposes will ensure transparency and oversight, support human judgment and review, monitor for bias and equity risks, strengthen data literacy and interpretation, use responsible procurement practices, and align with legal requirements and community values. <a

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6914.604s">Can</a> I stop you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6916.385s">Can</a> we do this one at a time, just so that if there are answers, we can not forget what the answer is before we get to the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6923.03s">OK,</a> so the first question, can you just tell us your first question again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6926.512s">It</a> was about bias and critical thinking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6967.061s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6968.542s">Member</a> Reinfeld, did you have an answer?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7256.533s">And</a> if I might from the chair, this policy lays out that students are responsible for this and teachers are responsible for setting the parameters by which it will be used in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7268.756s">So</a> just like any assignment that you get, your teacher is going to tell you what they expect from the assignment, how to cite things, whether you type it or you send it to them in the mail, like all of those things come from your teacher on an assignment by assignment basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7285.54s">And</a> this is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7287.021s">asking</a> anybody to do anything different than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7289.043s">It</a> is asking teachers to clearly outline that to you all, but it is asking you as a student to adhere to the use of the tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7297.554s">So</a> from a bias perspective, this policy is asking you to do it and it is asking teachers to do it and be clear about it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7530.25s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7532.151s">That's</a> quite a lot for your first meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7656.77s">So</a> if I could recap on the policy, I think I've heard a request to make clear that it is both student and teacher responsibility to check for bias, critical thinking and citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7677.836s">that</a> we clarify the use of the phrase ethical use and that we reference not just critical thinking but also the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7695.289s">potential</a> cognitive decline that is associated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7698.311s">Those</a> are the three changes potentially that I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7703.713s">And</a> the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7705.194s">And</a> the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7707.935s">So</a> I just wanted to recap that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7713.252s">No,</a> I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7715.333s">No,</a> it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7719.835s">So</a> potential updates would be reference to cognitive decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7727.319s">Like</a> direct reference that it is the expectation of both students and teachers to check for bias and citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7738.624s">The</a> environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7742.226s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7744.648s">We</a> said the clarification of ethical is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7747.389s">And</a> clarification of the word ethical to include environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7755.21s">So</a> those are the three things that I'm hearing in the room that might warrant an amendment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7769.757s">Can</a> you say more about what you're thinking about?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7792.796s">Um,</a> I believe that that is actually covered because it does talk about our data security practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7798.92s">So</a> any tool that would be approved would have to be compliant in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7805.264s">Otherwise,</a> it could not be approved.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7829.058s">Is</a> there a motion to approve the first reading with amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7840.645s">Motion</a> to approve the first reading as amended by member Rousseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7849.731s">Seconded</a> by member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7852.133s">No,</a> I believe that was the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7853.694s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7855.115s">The</a> voice came from over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7859.537s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7862.539s">Roll</a> call.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7878.889s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7881.543s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7883.084s">Six</a> in the affirmative, one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7886.306s">First</a> reading is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7891.608s">Are</a> we there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7933.174s">Is</a> there a motion to take the handbooks off the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7939.961s">Motion</a> to take the handbooks off the table by member and tapa there a second, seconded by member Reinfeld roll call, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7959.411s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7967.6s">7</a> in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7969.622s">We</a> will cycle back to the superintendent's recommendation to approve handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7976.148s">The</a> floor is yours again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7977.249s">And</a> I think we may have a question online that has to do with the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7983.395s">So</a> when you're done with your update about the handbooks, perhaps you can answer that question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8155.95s">Member</a> Ruseau, did you have a question about this topic before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8159.431s">Yes,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8160.171s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8398.836s">Dr.</a> DeLuzzi?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8562.648s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8667.83s">Member</a> Rheingold.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8826.339s">So</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8827.94s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8831.163s">Hi,</a> I think our students have something they would like to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8834.305s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8835.246s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8836.767s">So</a> hold on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8838.588s">Is</a> your mic on red?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8966.034s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8968.056s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8968.736s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8970.017s">Member</a> Reinfeld.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9315.256s">I</a> think we have one more handbook change to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9321.312s">Dr.</a> Galusi.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9351.773s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9352.054s">I</a> think we have somebody who has had their hand up online for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9356.757s">Will,</a> do you think you can unmute our guest? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9360.601s">While</a> you do that, members of the public are welcome to speak for up to three minutes on a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9366.566s">And</a> if you could please give us your name and address for the record.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9376.974s">Hi,</a> we can hear you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9499.642s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9504.587s">Hi,</a> thank you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9507.209s">In</a> general, a lot of those safety improvements that you're talking about would come from city resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9512.473s">But</a> what we can do and I'm going to do is ask the superintendent to be in contact with the chief of police so that if there are short term measures like a crossing guard, that we can have that conversation because that would have <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9528.931s">that</a> would happen under the guidance of the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9532.833s">So</a> we can ask the superintendent to do that, and then also talk with the building leader and some of our municipal staff about the broader safety questions that you're raising. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9546.181s">So</a> thank you for bringing those to our attention.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9639.645s">Okay,</a> thank you, that's very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9642.145s">Thank</a> you and thank you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9645.086s">We've</a> waylaid the agenda here, so appreciate you hanging in with us and the superintendent will reach out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9697.371s">Thank</a> you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9699.433s">Have</a> a good night.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9705.097s">Is</a> there a motion on the approval of the handbooks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9709.021s">Member</a> Intoppa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9731.373s">The</a> motion is to sever the AI policy from the handbook approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9736.796s">Is</a> your motion also to otherwise move approval?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9745.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9746.741s">Motion</a> by Member Intoppa to move approval of the handbooks with the exception of the AI policy, which will be on hold for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9756.915s">Seconded</a> by Member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9761.437s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9855.219s">So</a> the motion on the floor is to approve the handbooks <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9862.496s">with</a> the exception of the AI component of the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9866.998s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9868.639s">By</a> member Intoppa, seconded by member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9875.161s">Will</a> you call the roll?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10521.873s">Seven</a> any affirmative zero negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10526.415s">Okay,</a> we still have a ways to go here, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10528.837s">So</a> I'm going to take number seven, which is new business, we have an MSBA update, I'm going to try to give you a lightning update, so that we don't have to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10543.782s">here</a> for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10546.164s">On</a> Thursday of this week and then again on the 7th of October, Dr. Galusi, the mayor and I will be attending the designer selection panel with 10 colleagues from the MSBA and out of those two meetings will come a decision about who our designer will be and we will execute the contract in the month of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10565.822s">With</a> that designer on board, they will do two things that are sort of broadly called the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10571.764s">One</a> is they will prepare for a January submission where we talk about, essentially, what is our goal and what are we trying to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10579.948s">So</a> it includes things like, what is the educational program? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10582.949s">What</a> is our space summary? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10584.129s">What</a> are the existing conditions of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10586.75s">What</a> are we trying to accomplish with this bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10590.532s">That</a> is January 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10594.173s">In</a> June of 2026, we will do the second half of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10600.652s">which</a> will answer the question of what would a repair look like that is required by the MSBA? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10609.439s">What</a> would an ad reno look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10611.481s">And</a> what would a new building look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10613.283s">Those</a> three choices are required by the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10616.726s">And</a> those answers will be part of the report that we are targeting to the MSBA in June of 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10628.854s">From</a> there, we will then go into the sort of heavier design where we will be picking the actual systems that go into the building based on the preferred design, either repair, ad reno, or new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10645.145s">Based</a> on that, we'll start what they call schematic design, which is where we will look at the actual systems and the details and all of the nitty gritty that bring that box to life in a school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10658.014s">We</a> will, that's where we will onboard the construction manager more than likely, who will work alongside us as we do schematic design. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10667.416s">And</a> that process for schematic design will provide a scope and budget submission to the MSBA as well as ultimately a budget agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10679.759s">Our</a> plan for schematic design submission is January 2027 with board approval in April of 2027 and a vote to authorize the project to move forward presumably by debt exclusion in May of 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10699.332s">That</a> may spring vote will require approval by the building committee, it will come here, it will require a two thirds vote at the council and the agreement of the mayor to put those things on the ballot for decision by the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10716.523s">And</a> then shovels can go in the ground once the project is greenlighted by the taxpayers and the funding sources are secured in collaboration with MSBA and the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10727.829s">So</a> between now and June of 2027, there is a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10732.37s">But</a> I just wanted to give you that update because the most exciting part is we get to start the feasibility study very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10738.031s">That</a> is the question people are asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10740.132s">Are</a> we going to build new? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10741.072s">Where</a> is it going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10742.192s">Are</a> we going to keep the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10744.193s">All</a> of those questions get answered in feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10746.793s">So</a> between now and June of next year, we will have those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10749.854s">And</a> then we will begin moving forward based on a particular design. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10754.435s">Questions?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10772.462s">Once</a> the designer is onboarded, they will lay out a schedule for all of that community input, which will be sort of many layers and phases, including time with educators, time with RCTE, time with the public, info sessions, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10787.055s">So</a> all of that will start once that team is onboarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10791.179s">We</a> have four proposals, all very qualified designers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10797.124s">to</a> work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10799.105s">And</a> we will know who that is at the beginning of October, and then we'll execute an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10802.967s">And</a> then it will really be a question of timing in terms of do we start those kinds of engagement conversations before Thanksgiving, between Thanksgiving and the winter break, or something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10815.913s">So</a> that is a conversation that the building committee will have with the designer and the OPM so that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10821.576s">we</a> can keep on this tight timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10823.997s">We</a> are advancing some of the work due in January already, so that work is ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10828.92s">But</a> the OPM feels good that our timeline can be met and will be met by whoever is selected at the designer selection panel on the 7th of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10842.171s">this</a> year of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10843.552s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10844.973s">Yeah,</a> so there's so the first meeting is this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10848.236s">It</a> is sort of a roundtable like review of all of the proposals and then specific vendors will be invited back on the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10856.723s">And</a> at that meeting, they'll be invited to answer some specific questions and provide a presentation and then the panel of 16 will vote.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11380.355s">seven</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion to waive the reading passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11384.496s">So</a> I will just give a quick introduction to what's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11388.738s">Member</a> Ruseau and I are the only ones who have ever gone through a superintendent evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11394.539s">So</a> the goal of this was to do two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11398.041s">One</a> is to give us a timeline for doing that because we are somewhat off cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11402.862s">These</a> things typically happen in May or June for the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11406.584s">But</a> we want to make sure that we are evaluating the superintendent at the one year mark as important input to our coming decisions about the superintendent, the permanent appointment of a superintendent on July one, that Jesse does also require <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11423.541s">that</a> you set goals and then you measure progress against those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11428.184s">Because</a> of where we are in the process, this asks that we will use DESE's goals for evaluating new superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11437.791s">And</a> it also identifies the focus indicators on which I am proposing that we evaluate the superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11446.236s">So</a> there are many <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11448.177s">There</a> are many focused indicators on the evaluation and school committees are instructed to pick one or two per category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11455.662s">So</a> the resolution lists the recommendation that I made around the one or two from each category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11462.867s">There</a> are four standards, but it also, for your reference, lists all the rest of the focus indicators that are possibly ones that we would use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11474.635s">and</a> it does ask that the superintendent provide herself evaluation by the end of the calendar year this year, and that the superintendent's evaluation committee lead the process so that we are having this conversation by the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11488.72s">In</a> a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11491.24s">Happy</a> to take any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11494.141s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11547.587s">Member</a> Olapade?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11576.063s">I</a> can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11576.924s">So</a> in a typical cycle, the entire process starts with a goal setting where the superintendent says, this is what I think my goal should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11585.707s">And</a> we say, yes, we agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11586.888s">So</a> that's the Medford specific piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11588.929s">And</a> then at that time, we also say, and these indicators are the things that will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11593.971s">Additionally,</a> tell us that these goals are being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11595.992s">So</a> that's what you would do in a typical process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11598.734s">Because</a> we did not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11600.836s">My</a> proposal here is that we use the Jesse's rubric essentially for new superintendents in terms of what they should be doing in their first year, so that we're not deciding in October to on goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11614.304s">and</a> then we're going to evaluate them basically in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11617.067s">So</a> the idea behind that shift was because we did not do the formal goal setting when she started for all the reasons that the resolution lays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11627.278s">So</a> this is like a one-time kind of difference in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11632.944s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11635.407s">Member</a> Reinfeld.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11649.272s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11650.793s">The</a> role of community input can be any number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11656.115s">And</a> when the evaluation subcommittee meets, they may choose to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11661.837s">work</a> with the superintendent to identify something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11665.359s">Her</a> evaluation the superintendent's reflection on her own performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11670.601s">It</a> happens in this meeting, it is a matter of public record, the public is welcome to come speak for three minutes on any topic on our agenda so that stands and we can be really explicit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11681.146s">If</a> we want to be, I think it's sort of a general standing rule but <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11684.388s">given</a> where we are at in this process, that could be something that we want to take some extra care to describe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11691.732s">And</a> then the committee goes through a process where we all individually evaluate based on the rubric, and then that gets aggregated to a single <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11703.876s">evaluation</a> and that comes before this committee and then this committee has to accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11708.139s">So</a> that is another opportunity for community input that is built into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11713.824s">But</a> if the evaluation subcommittee wants to do something different, I think we are able to do those things if we want to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11723.051s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11724.252s">Member</a> Branley.

<a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=660.926s">What</a> stuck out as advantageous? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=664.066s">What</a> did you dislike about a particular proposal as compared to others? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=668.327s">What</a> did you view as being less than advantageous? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=671.828s">And</a> then what questions would you have for this applicant about their proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=676.629s">So</a> those are the three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=678.849s">We</a> can maybe just start. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=681.23s">Does</a> anyone have a proposal they want to start with that they feel very strongly about, Luke? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=688.684s">Okay,</a> hold on, hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=693.349s">We're</a> going to do one question at a time so that everybody can stick with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=697.674s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=698.414s">So</a> let's everyone has DLR's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=700.937s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=702.979s">So</a> this proposal is from DLR in collaboration <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=723.682s">And</a> then, Will, can you keep track of who is raising their hand online? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=727.145s">It's</a> a little hard for us to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=730.168s">I'll</a> leave the questions up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=731.409s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=735.193s">What</a> did we like about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=746.027s">Letty,</a> I like that they have experience working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=749.509s">I</a> recently had a large project that took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=752.792s">And</a> I think that Letty shows really strong design skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=756.254s">So</a> I think that's an example of a successful team. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=763.72s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=767.282s">Any</a> else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=800.368s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=803.45s">What</a> did you dislike about the DLR proposal as compared to others? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=808.192s">Or</a> what did you view as being less advantageous or less than advantageous?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=904.156s">I've</a> seen that people are having a hard time hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=906.237s">So</a> Emily, so far, the comments in the less advantageous category are that this group has light on experience with MSBA, that they seem to have a relatively large headcount. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=921.284s">And</a> that there are two firms in the mix with which to coordinate about the design. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=927.67s">That's</a> what we've covered so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=928.771s">Just</a> for those of you trying to listen here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=945.301s">speak</a> loudly for the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=948.042s">I</a> meant to speak up earlier, but then I got distracted looking at the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=950.984s">But</a> I actually think the fact that it's two firms is actually something that could be seen as advantageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=957.147s">You</a> have a lot of different voices, and you get to take the expertise of each of those firms and leave behind the things that the firms aren't as good at. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=968.673s">So</a> I think looking at them as one entity, it's not on us to figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=977.752s">There's</a> going to like, who's going to be in charge of this part of design? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=980.213s">Who's</a> going to be in charge of that part of the design? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=982.994s">Having</a> worked on both sides of projects where I've been either the architect of record or the design architect, all of this would be hammered out between two firms in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=994.959s">Skipping</a> ahead a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1000.684s">Like,</a> how are they going to handle these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1004.026s">You</a> know, they have extensive experience working together already, which leads me to believe that they already have this process in their minds of how they're going to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1017.557s">And</a> so I think it is actually very advantageous to take a firm that's really rooted in kind of the programming and analysis and then a firm that's really rooted in <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1029.814s">really</a> good design and bringing them together to create one super team. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1034.538s">Thanks,</a> Marissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1039.461s">Will,</a> is there anybody online who's got their hand up?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1082.02s">Thanks,</a> Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1085.722s">Is</a> anybody else online? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1094.499s">Anybody</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1096.48s">Brian?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1119.353s">So</a> for those of you online, the comment was that they're like sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1123.943s">prime</a> example for us is still a work in progress, and it's not yet complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1129.526s">So</a> we don't know how it turned out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1167.849s">Is</a> that typical, Matt and Jen? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1170.13s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about what is typical in terms of like how teams get put together?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1232.42s">Sometimes</a> they have in-house experience, so they look to themselves for those categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1237.102s">Sometimes</a> that makes it a little less clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1244.552s">example.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1245.212s">So</a> every question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1245.732s">So</a> it sounds like the teams will not necessarily look at because of how they come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1250.934s">Other</a> not advantageous things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1369.035s">What</a> we think of as vocational in Massachusetts is quite different than what vocational looks like in other places in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1375.867s">Can</a> you respond to that from a programming perspective? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1391.249s">Yes,</a> and I think that we're in a unique situation where we are a comprehensive high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1396.67s">We're</a> not a single vocational school, so all of our programs are Chapter 74, which means that there are requirements and regulations pertaining to content that we provide our students, the number of hours that they have in shop, as well as their academics, and then the number of hours that they are doing in the industry fields, whatever that may be, particular to the shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1421.26s">And</a> I know that we are to expand our programming and that some of the vocational programming standards have recently been increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1432.022s">A</a> lot of what I would just say that like from the lens of me reviewing a lot of these proposals would be like looking at that experience that a firm does have with the CTE programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1449.11s">that</a> is aligned and parallel to Medford, not a standalone CTE school, but one that's comprehensive, that at this time has full Chapter 74 shops, and one sort of space that is unique and brings with it a lot of flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1473.496s">Do</a> you need more detail? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1474.496s">No,</a> I'm good, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1476.037s">I</a> just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1477.879s">not</a> being in that world understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1480.441s">Is</a> it the same everywhere or is it different? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1483.784s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1484.644s">I</a> also would say that maybe also for me, I do not have a lot of MSBA experience coming into this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1495.073s">So</a> I think for someone like me reading these proposals, I found it very difficult to get a true understanding from the visuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1511.019s">on</a> the clarity of the image, the detail or lack of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1517.785s">It</a> was really hard for me to get a true understanding as to what the vision was for the proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1546.874s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1570.942s">Questions?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1571.402s">Libby?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1571.702s">I</a> think I'd ask just how frequently do they expect to be physically present in Boston for those who are not local? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1577.464s">So</a> are they flying in or doing remote meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1580.744s">Just</a> how often are they here in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1587.846s">That's</a> right, this was the team that was not terribly local, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1591.247s">Yeah,</a> Libby's local. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1592.347s">DLR</a> has some of them are local in Boston, but some are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1599.618s">What</a> other questions would we have for DLR? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1601.64s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1641.224s">So</a> for those of you at home wanting some more information on their cluster design concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1649.81s">Other</a> questions for DLR? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1664.816s">I'm</a> going to talk about Perkinsville next. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1679.804s">What</a> did we like about Perkinsville? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1687.768s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1790.937s">Overall,</a> I think the students are very clear, the graphics are very clear, and this gives me hope for and faith for our team, for how we move forward as a student community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1811.948s">And</a> I just think that there's some very clarity in the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1817.232s">they</a> actually are going to be able to work on our project of splitting wood in Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1821.175s">And</a> so some of the work I think is done both, but the team doing the work in the database is our project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1827.059s">Thanks,</a> Lori. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1832.844s">I</a> also like the idea that we take into account interdisciplinary learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1838.708s">That's</a> not just CTE, but <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1863.257s">So,</a> for those of you online so far, we, we've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1867.438s">The</a> likes include experience working with left field that Salem high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1873.299s">Is</a> ongoing and ahead of us that they took a stab at a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1879.609s">That</a> they're prioritizing community space, outdoor learning, geothermal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1884.292s">Messaging</a> was quite clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1887.674s">They</a> are not splitting their team with other projects like Salem and they are focused on interdisciplinary learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1896.338s">Just</a> so that you, in case you all were having a hard time hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1901.621s">Also.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1917.81s">Yeah,</a> when when we were we were doing the tour, there were lots of questions about those kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1926.384s">And</a> we really tried to paint a picture for everybody who is here that <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1931.442s">There</a> are some interesting spaces in this building that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1934.624s">We</a> should be looking at to say, is this worth preserving or. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1940.067s">Is</a> it not for some reason, but that that was 1 of the spaces we talked about wanting explicitly to be able to evaluate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1949.853s">Does</a> it stay does it goes what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1953.515s">That</a> also included the gym because it's quite big. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1964.623s">Well,</a> in terms of how they were trying to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1971.306s">Hey,</a> what was less advantageous.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2042.788s">And</a> their team also didn't seem to have lots of vocational experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2049.951s">Am</a> I remembering that correctly?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2087.606s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2088.226s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2088.486s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2088.887s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2091.027s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2091.347s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2091.628s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2091.908s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2092.228s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2121.663s">I</a> mean, not the same things, obviously, but like the same, just like not the same stuff that you don't necessarily need in a regular classroom, like that type of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2137.571s">This</a> one, their experience spans beyond public schools and beyond high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2143.855s">And</a> while it might, I have a similar question to you, <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2158.052s">strictly</a> educational spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2163.113s">To</a> me, I would be very curious to see how does that experience match up to what we need here in Medford with a very unique site and the possibilities of being able to do something <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2188.91s">Other</a> things we thought were less advantageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2192.272s">Okay,</a> what questions do you have for this firm? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2214.564s">Share</a> questions for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2219.977s">renovating</a> Jibsville, CTE, or anything else for that matter, to all the ones that experience some sort of solar, whether that's solar, public parking lot, buildings, to the components of whatever project we choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2241.367s">Other</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2283.397s">Other</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2287.018s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2297.162s">Two</a> down, two to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2300.122s">I'm</a> going to do AI3 next. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2302.623s">Happens</a> to be one right in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2313.669s">OK,</a> what did we find advantageous about AI3?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2529.666s">I</a> would say what I think is very advantageous about AI3 is that, as you mentioned previously, during the tour, I felt like this proposal captured a lot of what we have said in our profile, as well as what's mentioned on the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2548.453s">So</a> they were very specific to call out some details about how we want to make sure we have a collaborative space for teachers and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2559.981s">how</a> different options for how the learning environment can be staffed while maintaining some of these spaces and how they can be creative to Aaron's point about using the scope of our land. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2574.725s">I</a> just felt like they were listening and really specifically targeting their examples to the specifics of it, right down to even like the community outreach and some of the local <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2589.793s">The</a> events going to, I just, I just probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2594.274s">For</a> those of you online, I'm going to give you a quick rundown of what has been said if you all can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2601.716s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2602.136s">Thumbs</a> up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2604.176s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2606.256s">So,</a> here's the list that I've captured. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2608.017s">They've</a> done 60 projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2611.418s">They</a> have an in house CTE expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2614.418s">They</a> had creative ideas around underground parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2618.858s">At</a> a separate aquatic center, they've identified bids that are under budget, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2627.764s">Their</a> aesthetic design appeals to more than 1 person in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2632.908s">They,</a> they sort of worked with our on the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2638.331s">Idea</a> rather than trying to flatten it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2642.394s">As</a> well as the founder being directly involved in the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2650.545s">So,</a> hopefully less tension and more cohesion on the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2654.847s">They</a> have worked with left field before. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2658.288s">The</a> Watertown building that's set to open in the spring is a net zero building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2662.27s">And</a> that they were very clearly listening to the tour and the kinds of things that we were talking about that were important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2672.034s">Like</a> an expedited timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2673.634s">And</a> the. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2678.98s">overall</a> their, you know, clear commitment to public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2684.447s">So</a> that's what's been going on here in case you all have been having a hard time hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2689.573s">Are</a> there any likes from the group on the phone that you wanted to share? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2703.695s">I</a> see a comment from Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2705.676s">They</a> have a strong focus on integrating CTE in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2708.977s">Thanks,</a> Maria.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2727.344s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2728.804s">I</a> will grab those out at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2732.74s">Um,</a> were there things that we saw about this presentation that were. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2736.803s">Not</a> advantageous or such. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2745.128s">Fairly</a> diverse and diversifying and. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2748.811s">The</a> people on the team, I didn't see very much diversity in the group, which is always a concern to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2757.617s">Obviously.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2765.006s">Other</a> things that were not advantageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2797.818s">This</a> is a little bit personal, but I think just compared to other firms, their designs just feel a little bit leaning towards an online-free design. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2806.18s">I</a> think it's something that was over-elevated towards, I know, not higher education, but you know, 9 through 12, as opposed to younger children.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2821.523s">Flash</a> that out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2824.946s">Colors,</a> just materials, chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2827.867s">When</a> you get to high school level, it's just a personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2834.348s">And</a> sometimes things skew a little bit too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2837.109s">Fun</a> and silly, and that's better for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2842.49s">Other,</a> not advantageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2851.707s">For</a> those of you on the phone, the two that came up is that the team is not very diverse in its composition, and then that the design leans towards younger children rather than towards young adults and almost adults, nearly adults, which gives me a little bit of a heart attack personally with two kids in this building now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2875.944s">Okay,</a> what questions would we have for AI? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2884.835s">I</a> have a question just to say, maybe the way they structure their team, but they're a person they call project manager, so they have 25% of their time available for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2892.458s">Now</a> they have other people that have more, so it might just be that that person isn't doing the same manager job that someone else is, but I just wanted to be very clear about this requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2901.021s">If</a> someone's looking at 25%, that means that those tasks are being done by someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2908.144s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2908.244s">Other</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3016.977s">thing</a> that this other vendor did and tell us about sort of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3021.5s">So</a> I think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3023.721s">Yeah,</a> they might and they might not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3024.982s">I</a> mean, there's, there's many reasons to rule things out on the site, like, you know, in terms of timing, landscape, ledge, and all the other things that could be going on that they just may have some <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3043.657s">There</a> are questions for, were we talking about AI3? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3047.22s">I</a> had a question that was for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3050.302s">And</a> it was basically, nobody in any of their thoughts thought about addressing the entry, the traffic entry, everybody just making it one driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3063.131s">I</a> know that that was like a big thing that we all talked about already. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3067.414s">So</a> I'd like a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3078.746s">It</a> was like a lot to take all of this in and be like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3083.748s">Now,</a> which one am I in?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3085.729s">And</a> all the pieces and parts were hard to keep track of.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3112.297s">Yeah,</a> yeah, I mean, they all are being on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3120.821s">Oh,</a> so just like one way for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3123.623s">Everybody</a> wants to get into the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3127.025s">But</a> I think the like, road coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3131.127s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3133.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3134.829s">The</a> other questions about AI is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3141.968s">And</a> number four, SMMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3143.469s">What</a> did we like?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3178.138s">It</a> felt like a really cohesive proposal, like all of the parts were cohesive with the other parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3208.897s">I</a> hope the choice of agency is smart because that's what our master plan would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3216.701s">It's</a> a landscape architect, but for what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3219.662s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3260.912s">I</a> think the other side of that for someone like me, who doesn't have an architect background, an engineering, design background, I was wanting just a little bit more detail as to where this is headed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3276.882s">So</a> I guess that's a double-edged sword, I would say.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3304.313s">Their</a> likes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3304.754s">I</a> like that they had a lot of disabled projects at a wide range of price points.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3393.657s">Okay,</a> on to things that are less advantageous.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3574.477s">For</a> advantages, they have done 3 CTE programs very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3579.278s">They've</a> got whole hog on solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3582.519s">They</a> have the largest in-house team. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3587.18s">Their</a> proposal was cohesive from beginning to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3591.042s">They</a> do have some sub consultants who were involved in Bedford's comprehensive plan, so they would have a connection to Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3598.003s">Their</a> concept seemed very open-ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3600.664s">They</a> had a wide range of projects in terms of price points, so that <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3605.708s">And</a> then on the dislike side, so far, we have some questions about, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3625.189s">that.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3625.99s">And</a> then that they are simultaneously doing Wakefield and Lexington at different phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3632.574s">But</a> there are shared resources in this proposed team that also are working on Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3638.358s">And</a> Lexington is going to be a monster of a project based on what it's a very, very large high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3647.225s">Lexington.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3647.825s">Yes,</a> they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3649.606s">They</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3650.667s">They</a> did put a visual in their proposal about <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3655.418s">I</a> think trying to tell us that the timing, the phasing of our project versus Lexington was different. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3661.243s">I</a> think that's what this visual was trying to tell us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3664.225s">I</a> actually had some questions much like Luke about doesn't this sound like it's longer? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3670.47s">So</a> I think that visual just probably needs some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3677.516s">Anything</a> from the folks online? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3679.178s">I</a> see another hand.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3849.909s">We'll</a> get a chance after this first part of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3856.383s">We're</a> asked to open for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3878.222s">questions</a> are going to be asked across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3887.187s">So</a> it won't be specific to one proposal or one architect, those blank questions in relation to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3897.731s">Let</a> me follow up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3898.812s">You</a> said, so I know originally, please correct me, the thought was we'd get a bunch <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3908.037s">do</a> you think that is so narrow for you to purview or exactly what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3913.823s">Right,</a> right, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3914.483s">It'll</a> be the three voices on the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3921.37s">So</a> they will decide if they want to be right, they might go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3925.514s">If</a> I want to see it all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3958.504s">there</a> will be a ranking with all of the MP numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3961.626s">And</a> at that point, if they see there's two better run runners, and the other one starts ranking so far below, they might just pick two, or everybody has the same field ranking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4017.886s">that</a> it takes to put into the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4021.969s">But</a> I think what this is saying, my chart, is the proposed design, body carbon is 20% less than the typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4028.354s">So</a> it's saying that the body carbon reduction is 20%.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4036.219s">But</a> that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4037.4s">It's</a> through use of sustainable materials, like certified wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4042.023s">I</a> guess I was confused by the proposed design. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4059.207s">Okay,</a> other questions that we would want to ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4070.557s">And</a> then I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4072.559s">Are</a> there other questions that we feel like.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4116.761s">My</a> biggest thing that I do is about storage and places to put supplies and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4150.416s">So</a> are there any questions online about either SMMA or maybe the field overall? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4162.123s">Questions</a> you'd want to be asking everybody?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4208.992s">Sorry,</a> I'm going to miss this, but how is parking heat forecasted? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4213.876s">Is</a> there anything in your design that would change the parking heat? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4223.283s">The</a> question was from a parking heat perspective, is that a formula or how is that determined and how does that integrate into your design? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4234.932s">How</a> does that get determined on these projects?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4345.618s">Sorry,</a> energy code. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4346.458s">It's</a> been something I'll make sure their energy is clear and they're ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4351.0s">So,</a> or if they need an extra consultant to help them navigate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4355.783s">It's</a> pretty ambitious. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4358.864s">I</a> think that's about it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4360.665s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4378.442s">Um,</a> so the 1st designer selection panel meeting is next week, Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4385.184s">And</a> we will know once the meeting is over what our finalists are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4392.125s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4396.967s">And</a> so we will let you all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4399.147s">What</a> the outcome of that meeting is so that you're aware of what's coming next. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4410.374s">6,</a> we will interview and then we will know during that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4415.924s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4434.489s">You</a> do, probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4437.43s">We</a> can collect a list if there's anybody who would like to participate because they usually ask us in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4447.534s">So</a> we'll send out an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4449.434s">I</a> did have one thing.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=221.459s">Motion</a> to enter executive session by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=223.961s">Seconded</a> by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=227.384s">Member</a> Ruseau, if you can call the roll.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=242.076s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=243.657s">Six</a> in the affirmative, seven, six, seven in the affirmative, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=247.62s">Zero</a> in the negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=249.902s">We</a> will resume after executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=253.145s">Thanks</a> everyone.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4684.276s">Yeah,</a> as I'm reading the letter from Cummings, it sort of infers that there's a report that we filed <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4696.376s">an</a> impact report, and they're asking for us to reflect on variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4700.938s">So</a> I think lifting restrictions is vague, and it probably means something specific that accompanied the letter in some way, or that there's some change in reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4712.063s">So</a> I think we just want to be clear on what those changes are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4741.433s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4742.533s">Can</a> I just ask one other quick question about the scholarship? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4751.359s">from</a> Steve McCarthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4754.762s">This</a> letter doesn't say that it's an expectation that it's set up as an endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4761.747s">So</a> in other words, like being sort of corned off in an interest bearing account. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4766.61s">And</a> I know that we've had issues with other similar <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4772.533s">awards</a> like this, so I just was hoping that we could just check into and be clear on whether that needs to be established that way from the outset or if it's just a straight <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4784.615s">amount</a> of money that will be like worked down over the course of the 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4790.419s">So</a> 10 times 500. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4791.38s">I</a> think that's what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=4793.542s">But</a> I would just like to be clear because we have some other situations that did not appear to get set up quite as as the grant as the donation intended.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6748.816s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6750.196s">These</a> folks will replace Dr. Cushing as a voting member and Dr. Talbot will take Joan Bowen's place who was previously a non-voting member and we elevated her to a voting member when we <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6765.141s">elevated</a> Dr Galusi and removed Dr Edward Benson from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6768.943s">So</a> there's one non-voting spot, which we are asking Dr Talbot to take on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6777.546s">And</a> so this committee has to vote, and then we'll send that to the MSBA, and they'll have to accept those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=6783.448s">But</a> that is usually pretty straightforward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7616.119s">do</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7616.88s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7617.46s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7618.961s">Yes,</a> over this summer, I met with some Medford residents and met with the president of the city council and some folks that are from organizations that provide this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7630.27s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7632.312s">The</a> way that this whole process works is we have this, the council first has to say yes we're adopting the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7640.202s">And</a> then once the council does that, under the law, then we have to the superintendent can like bring a contract forward we can approve that contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7651.895s">and</a> then it can be put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7654.237s">The</a> law does not require the sum of the steps that I have outlined that I think are important around like collaboration across city government and with the chief of police to think about sort of ticket revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7666.464s">But</a> to the question about who pays for this, Medford is a community that's been designated by one vendor in particular, but I assume by many as a, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7679.631s">a</a> city where the violators will essentially fund the whole cost of the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7686.52s">So</a> essentially, they will put these stop arm cameras on the buses for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7693.42s">they</a> will take a piece of the violation revenue that gets issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7699.525s">And</a> in an event where there are no violations for a month, they eat that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7705.068s">And</a> it's sort of a numbers game, like that's not happening in very small communities, but the sort of dynamics of Medford, the number of students, the number of buses, the number of roads, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7716.716s">the</a> size of the city, all of that makes us a candidate for this violator funded protocol that they are pursuing with many communities like Peabody and Salem and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7727.319s">So</a> over time, what happens, the way the process works is the camera <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7736.074s">takes</a> a picture of you in the middle of a moving violation three times, like front, middle, back or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7742.196s">So</a> it's like, it's you, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7744.497s">So</a> they can tell who the car is and what the light is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7748.119s">This</a> organization will then do like a first level culling of all of the footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7756.565s">and</a> pull out anything that is like, you know, blurry image, not, you know, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7762.271s">So</a> they'll pull all of those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7763.892s">All</a> of that's then transmitted to the police department where they will review the footage, they will issue the citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7768.937s">So</a> the police department, and I know that there have been some meetings with the chief of police as well, the police department will issue the citations just like they would, you know, any moving citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7779.107s">This</a> is not a citation like if you get a ticket, it's a fine and it could down the line prevent you from like renewing your license. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7787.052s">But</a> it is not going to be tagged as a moving violation on your insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7792.455s">But</a> that ticket revenue comes back to the city into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7797.518s">So</a> part of my ask is that we sort of cordon off that funding so that we are using it to <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7806.163s">continue</a> to improve safety for our students that are riding buses and walking, frankly, and think about how do we how do we leverage this, this funding to hear from the community, via all of these different players being involved to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7822.878s">do</a> some things that will improve pedestrian and bus rider safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7827.759s">So</a> that is something that I'm requesting in this but it is like separate from what is required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7833.321s">So</a> this ask is just to say to the council that we agree that we want to do this so that they can adopt the statute and then it would it'll come back to us for like execution of the of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7848.264s">I</a> do have a video I can send to all of you after the meeting which I just received <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7853.045s">But</a> I think overall, like there's a lot of, you know, having a vendor do this, first of all, they're going to maintain the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7860.709s">If</a> the cameras stop working, they will replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7863.029s">If</a> we get new buses, they will retrofit the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7865.49s">You</a> know, they'll pull them off one bus, put them on another bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7868.152s">So,</a> and then they take a portion of the revenue for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7872.593s">I</a> forget what the exact numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7874.134s">I</a> don't have them handy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7875.134s">But</a> there is no cost to Medford to do this, but the ticket revenue does come to Medford.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7899.144s">Yeah,</a> they did have a lot of good information, which they're more than happy to come join us at the next meeting if the superintendent wants to move forward with them as a vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7911.154s">And</a> they had a lot of information about sort of what happens over time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7915.477s">There's</a> lots of moving violations, and then they do sort of plateau. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7918.619s">But</a> he pointed out that we are, you know, minting new drivers every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7923.823s">My</a> daughter's in driver's ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7926.445s">So,</a> you know, there's new drivers on the road all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7929.307s">Medford,</a> one of the things he talked a lot about was that Medford is a cut-through city for many communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7934.791s">So</a> you can't get to the highway unless you come through Medford if you live in certain communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7940.274s">And</a> those are those roads where it's particularly challenging for students to cross safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7946.356s">So</a> I thought all of this, there was just a lot of net positive for us and for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7953.899s">And</a> if we stop having revenue because there are no more moving violations, that is also a win because that means people aren't passing school buses when they should not be and endangering students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7966.743s">there</a> seems like there's only wins in this, which is exciting to be able to choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7971.047s">So</a> yeah, they're happy to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7974.329s">They</a> offered to come tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7975.31s">And</a> I said, since this is like the first time we're going to talk about this, and then the council will have to do their thing, and then we'll have to come back around, that it might be more appropriate for them to come next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7984.238s">But</a> they're very excited about Medford and partnering to make our streets safer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8134.251s">I</a> did bring my notebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8135.991s">They</a> did a three month pilot in Peabody, and there were 977 violations and in Salem there were 942 in a three month pilot so those pilots are very recent because the law just passed sort of paving the way for all of this to happen in a more cohesive way, but they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8157.336s">that</a> there are 300 cars hit school buses last year in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8163.018s">They</a> also did describe that they are actively working in many other states who already have legislation around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8170.42s">So</a> they are not a new organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8173.561s">There's</a> just new access here in Massachusetts, if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8178.542s">And</a> then the cost that they will extract <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8185.135s">from</a> the total revenue is, I believe it's $250 per bus per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8191.359s">They</a> did also note that they can put cameras on special education vehicles as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8197.542s">However,</a> if those special education vehicles transporting students leave Medford, the cameras are not able to be used outside of the city limits of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8208.528s">So</a> they would only be capturing <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8211.87s">things</a> happening yeah in districts in district roads um and um it's a 250 ticket and they find that when you get a ticket you do not usually get a second ticket but if there are some people who do um so it's yeah it's not um an inexpensive <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8234.078s">ticket,</a> but they do see over time that like in sort of year one, there'll be the most tickets and then it will plateau and sort of level out to be something sort of consistent after that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8275.97s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8276.19s">The</a> camera does not record anything going on inside the bus.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8309.707s">They</a> are on an approved vendor list, so that is not a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8313.531s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8314.412s">There</a> are other companies that do portions of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8319.637s">I've</a> not sort of looked into them in tons of detail, but my understanding is <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8326.403s">part</a> of what this organization in particular is offering is the curation right so they're like maintaining the cameras they're previewing the footage they're calling out all the stuff that's junk so that when it gets to the police department here in Medford it's a it's an easier <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8344.873s">lift</a> for Medford to go ahead and issue those citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8347.975s">So</a> there is a level of like services that they're providing in addition to all the camera maintenance, all the installs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8356.541s">So</a> you can buy cameras with lots of different people, but then you'd have to have the manpower to do the editing and the reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8362.486s">So</a> their technology obviously is serving them up what is useful, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8367.03s">Like</a> if the arm comes out and nothing happens, there's still footage and their technology is like weeding all of that out on our behalf.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8392.719s">I</a> don't believe that's possible just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8396.12s">They</a> did talk about, perhaps you could send a warning without an actual citation, and that they were more than willing to explore all of that with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8409.464s">But</a> every city has its own like piece of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8414.446s">Because</a> some cities like ours have sort of the luxury of having being violated or funded our neighboring communities probably do not in for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8425.971s">So</a> I think some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8428.276s">will</a> maybe come together over time, but probably not right at the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8433.378s">But</a> the implementation, they're eager, and they're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8436.659s">And</a> we did not ask about the specific timeline, because we weren't sure what it was going to take to get through these steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=8442.822s">But</a> they seemed to feel good about things moving quickly.<h2><a href="../2025-08-14_R1mdipx9dPE/2025-08-14_R1mdipx9dPE.html">08.13.2025 SC Executive Session</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=796.722s">Luke,</a> I was just trying to call on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=799.283s">Matt,</a> Luke has a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=800.484s">Do</a> you think you could pause for a couple of questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=805.826s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=806.766s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=876.47s">And</a> in fact, um, when we went through this with, um, the OPM selection, the advice we got from our, uh, city solicitor was that all of those things could be made available once the contract was executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=891.215s">Um,</a> so there, while they are public records, they're not <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=896.38s">for</a> consumption during the selection process in that broad way that they would otherwise be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=903.283s">So</a> we immediately got lots of requests for people who did not get selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=908.205s">And</a> the guidance from the city solicitor was that they have to wait until the contract is executed and then we'll provide those requested documents to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=916.788s">And</a> that's exactly what we did.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=923.191s">Does</a> anyone else have questions before we continue?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=969.764s">Any</a> other questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1213.015s">Am</a> I correct that the MSBA is pretty prescriptive about what must be included in the proposal, just like they are with the RFS for OPMs? <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1223.083s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1223.944s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1224.725s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1225.425s">So</a> I think the structure in general, the structure of the proposals will look somewhat similar because they're required to complete the same set of documents, and I think you'll <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1238.632s">Sort</a> of quickly find the pieces of the proposal that speak to you and it may or may not be what the prescribed attachments are and they weren't for me certainly in the RFS review process for the OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1253.036s">So</a> I think it's good to just take them in for what they are when we receive them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1261.358s">So</a> unless people have specific questions, I don't think we need to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1266.16s">Any</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1355.71s">I</a> think we have one question from Luke.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1573.085s">So</a> I can answer that we have a building committee scheduled in the timeframe between August 27th and the designer selection panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1582.891s">I'm</a> not exactly remembering the date, but there is 1 scheduled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1589.385s">September.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1590.706s">And</a> it was scheduled that way so that the entire committee could provide their insight and perspective to the members of the DSP. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1601.915s">Unless</a> this team feels differently, that that should not be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1605.777s">That</a> was what we were planning on for the next building committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1611.182s">September</a> 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1612.523s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1626.298s">So,</a> before we move on, is there anybody who feels like we should not proceed in that fashion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1717.958s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1719.639s">The</a> MSBA does not want the left field team telling us what we should pick. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1727.764s">So</a> they're here to help guide our process, but it is our process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1795.257s">Yeah,</a> and I think we also have a very well-represented committee with lots of different strengths and interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1808.185s">And</a> so I don't think everyone needs to evaluate every proposal on all the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1815.247s">But</a> I'll pick on Tracy for just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1818.249s">I'm</a> expecting Tracy to tell us what he thinks about all things performing arts, because that is his background, and his passion, and the things that he's good at. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1831.598s">And</a> one of the reasons his application was so appealing to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1835.18s">So</a> I think everyone's going to bring a different set of criteria to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1840.744s">And</a> I think when we talk about what impressed us about people, <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1845.007s">What</a> didn't seem like it was sufficient in our next meeting, I think we'll hear, you know, lots of different perspectives from lots of different people that will help us be as prepared as possible to be 3 of 13 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1860.322s">So</a> we have a big job to do to, like, represent Medford amongst a bunch of people who. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1869.428s">Certainly</a> have done this more than we have, but are not don't live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1873.252s">And,</a> you know, aren't the ones that will receive this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1876.996s">So</a> I think all the all that feedback, the better in our next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1894.992s">I'm</a> just saying that, like, we don't need we don't need everybody, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1899.775s">Going</a> through all the, like, my new shut and the nitty gritty, like, left field is going to handle the qualifying things. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1906.48s">And</a> if there are things that you're particularly passionate about, that's what we want to hear from this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1912.525s">We</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1914.172s">And</a> if you have the time and inclination to go through every part of the proposal, that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1920.214s">But</a> just everyone has a different amount of ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1924.995s">So</a> we can, but I think that I just don't want people to be discouraged from putting their like piece, you know, their piece of their interest into the conversation if they don't have time to review everything, which is just kind of, you know, it's going to be September and back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1942.82s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1943.598s">We</a> should prepare for that, too.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=1980.962s">Yeah,</a> exactly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2308.092s">Are</a> there any questions from the committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2384.198s">Yep,</a> much better.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2754.216s">Matt,</a> you're correct that the finance committee at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2758.258s">Talked</a> about several sites that did not make it into our final package and this was 1 of them where it was discussed and rolled out because of the, like, multiple business, the multiple building project need the, you know, the traffic patterns that would be exacerbated in that area, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2776.564s">So</a> that 1 was not in contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2778.765s">And</a> your analysis is supporting that that would not be super viable for us to consider going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2785.387s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2830.249s">Before</a> you go on, I think Luke has another question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2954.063s">The</a> other thing that's important to know about our square footage currently is that 1395 is high school students only. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2964.109s">It</a> is not Kids Corner, it's not the MFN, it's not the administrative offices, and it is not the preschool expansion that was written into our <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2976.112s">bid</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2976.712s">So</a> all of those, so 1395 in terms of number of students and the associated square footage, that's one portion of the square footage that comprises what currently happens in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2989.317s">So</a> I think we still, there's still a lot of work to do for us to sort of grapple with like how, what, how many square feet are we building here? <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=2996.58s">Cause</a> there's a lot of other parts that are not in that 1395 plus the administrative offices, Luke, plus the Medford family network. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3006.442s">Um,</a> and those are all things that will have to go somewhere eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3012.849s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3014.451s">Okay,</a> Matt, do you want to keep going?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3128.631s">That</a> is true.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3288.863s">Not</a> seeing any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3295.579s">If</a> you all take a look at your agenda, we brought this back around in this meeting, because our June meeting, we talked about potentially removing Medford square and Columbus park as options to sort of reduce the scope of what the feasibility study will be looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3318.22s">And</a> if you remember back to the June meeting, we talked about wanting to do this exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3324.882s">Thank</a> you, Matt for doing such a thorough job to make sure that, you know, inevitably when people have questions that there is a place we can point them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3334.825s">So</a> we can certainly make this available on our website, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3338.385s">But</a> I did want to circle back around the potential motion is written out on the. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3345.235s">on</a> the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3347.218s">If</a> anybody would like to make that motion now, I would be happy to entertain it, but that's up to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/AhbnPsYYkrc&t=3356.391s">Mayor?</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9671.03s">Hi,</a> my name is Anna Meyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9672.811s">I</a> live at 6 Douglas Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9675.933s">I</a> am so grateful to the Medford residents who helped write this ordinance and especially to President Bears for his work over the last eight months in making sure that this ordinance is as clear as possible <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9687.498s">is</a> aligned with Massachusetts state law and is in the best interests of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9692.181s">I've</a> spoken in favor of this ordinance before, and so I'm going to try to keep my comments brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9697.664s">But</a> fundamentally, the world that I want to be a part of and one that I try to work towards every day is one that values the lives of children everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9705.69s">and</a> is trying to create a safer and healthier world from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9710.055s">I</a> believe this is a powerful moment to reimagine the kind of community that we want to create and be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9716.181s">I</a> think this ordinance speaks to aligning our values, because the way that we spend our money is political. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9722.508s">If</a> there are companies that meet the standard of this ordinance, meaning that they make their profit from fossil fuels and the city can't invest in them anymore, I think that's the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9730.311s">The</a> way that we invest our money can put pressure on companies to stop profiting from fossil fuels and other harmful measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9737.27s">I'm</a> especially proud of the way that this ordinance will ensure that Medford is not and will not be invested in detention centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9744.014s">I</a> work in immigration advocacy, and I know that in talking to so many community members in Medford, how shocked they were to watch Masks, agent of the state, kidnap Tufts graduate student Ramesa Ozturk earlier this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9757.783s">I</a> know so many of my neighbors have felt overwhelmed and helpless. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9760.664s">and</a> helpless in the face of this cruelty. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9763.146s">And</a> I think that this is such a powerful moment to get to say and take a stand that Medford does not stand for this violence, and also will not benefit from the <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9776.814s">will</a> not profit or in any way benefit from these detention centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9780.296s">On</a> Sunday, I rallied with Jewish community members, including some from Medford outside of the ICE office in Burlington, because they object to the weaponization of anti-Semitism that justify these kidnappings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9790.781s">I'm</a> also a high school history teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9792.722s">I</a> am alarmed to see that ICE is also detaining high school students, including Marcelo Gomez da Silva, who was taken to that ICE facility in Burlington, where we know that people are sleeping on concrete floors, eating crackers for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9806.789s">We</a> know where Mesa Ozturk was taken to a facility where she was not given adequate food and medical treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9811.472s">And</a> I'm so proud that this ordinance will affirm that Medford tax dollars will not be invested in those systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9816.476s">I'm</a> also proud of the way this ordinance speaks to the way in which these systems are interconnected. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9820.699s">I've</a> heard some speakers say tonight they want to divest from fossil fuel, but they're hesitant to divest from Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9825.422s">The</a> strength of this ordinance is that it shows us how these values are interconnected. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9828.704s">IDF</a> bombing has destroyed fresh drinking water on farmland in Gaza and contributed significantly to carbon pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9834.668s">to</a> protect the environment, needs to stop the ruthless bombing and starvation in Gaza, and divesting from companies that profit from fossil fuel and weapons will do both of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=9843.091s">I'm</a> so moved by all my community members who have spoken tonight in favor of creating this world together. <a

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10067.601s">Hi,</a> my name is Anna Meyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10069.342s">I</a> live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10073.905s">I</a> teach US history, and I really appreciate the ability to every year look at the course of US history. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10080.27s">And</a> I think that fundamentally, we have to understand that our economy was started by stealing land, by exploiting labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10087.595s">And</a> it's only then been shaped by continued ecological extraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10093.038s">and</a> the industry of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10094.319s">It</a> blows my mind every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10095.5s">The</a> US economy spent more money on World War II than it had in the previous however many years of its history combined and then doubled. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10103.164s">This</a> country is built on war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10105.425s">And</a> I think it's really easy to feel hopeless about that as our president starts wars with that congressional approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10113.509s">I</a> think that so often so much feels out of our control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10116.971s">And</a> I am so grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10120.092s">for</a> working on this ordinance, because I think that it is a moment of calling back local control and saying that there is local money in Medford that are invested in corporations, specifically there's money invested in Lockheed Martin and Chevron that are doing harm in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10137.576s">And</a> I think this is a moment of imagining what an economy is like and what a community is like when our money is invested where our values are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10145.697s">Specifically,</a> I want to talk about immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10148.499s">I</a> also work as an advocate for immigrants in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10152.64s">I</a> want to call specific attention to the section of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10156.702s">That</a> would mean that Med for Money is not investing in detention centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10160.664s">I'm</a> specifically concerned about the students, college students, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10164.686s">High</a> school students are being kidnapped off the street and increasingly brought to for profit detention centers, where they're kept without due process where they're kept without access to the medical needs that they have they're being legitimately discriminated against. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10177.85s">And</a> I think that it would really. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10180.271s">And</a> I would also just name like specifically in Medford like people are kidnapped off the street last weekend and taken to an ice jail. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10185.573s">in</a> Burlington where we know people are being kept on floors, they're sleeping there, given Mylar blankets or eating crackers for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10193.459s">This</a> is not where we want Medford's money to be invested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10196.881s">And</a> I appreciate people have already raised concerns tonight about the logistics of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10201.125s">And</a> I appreciate that I cannot speak to all of the specifics of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10205.808s">But</a> I think even though it's complicated, there's really good work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10209.911s">And</a> I would urge city councilors to take it on as <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10214.254s">an</a> act of good faith that it is worth this work to be doing, especially as a way of inspiring other cities and towns of looking carefully at their investments and making sure that they're invested in the things that stand for those city's values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10225.862s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-18_yGcuIBQZTjc/2025-06-18_yGcuIBQZTjc.html">06.18.2025 Last Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=71.294s">I</a> am, can you hear me?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1378.229s">Sorry,</a> I'm just not finding the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1380.13s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1380.69s">I'll</a> relocate myself before the meeting's over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1385.071s">I</a> know we had talked, it may have been like a year or two ago now, about the declining enrollment in CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1391.633s">And</a> I wondered if you could talk to us about the number of students participating this year versus years past.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1444.543s">And</a> so what's the plan to not just say it's because we lost an advisor, but to replenish the numbers of the students participating?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1486.897s">So</a> the advisors are all unpaid? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1489.798s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1526.315s">So</a> we don't have an advisor for the high school yet next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1529.017s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1533.06s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1534.641s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1535.001s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1683.3s">I</a> was just like digging through the recently done teacher's contract and this is one of the stipends that I believe sits outside of the teacher's contract because it is paid via a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1694.925s">Is</a> that correct, Dr. Glucy? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1697.786s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1699.587s">So</a> I guess maybe a programming note for CCSR is that we have dramatically shifted <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1707.593s">I</a> think for the better the stipends that we are offering both for athletics and for extracurriculars and. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1716.221s">Perhaps</a> the CCSR team may want to look at what we did as a model for what we believe is needed for the kind of support and dedication that we expect of advisors, because it is a lot of work, particularly for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1731.732s">And</a> one of the things we did in the contract, which is available on our website, is we introduced a tier structure to the academic <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1741.369s">Um,</a> and extracurricular stipends that sort of talk about, like, the intensiveness of the activity so that there's some. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1749.542s">Like,</a> I'll say tearing for lack of a better word of the kinds of clubs and activities and what they require. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1756.673s">So</a> that may be a good place to look to say where does this fit and is the current set of stipends enough or is there somewhere else in the CCSR budget that we could pull from to make those positions more appealing, especially as we have shifted the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1772.828s">So</a> that number may. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1775.39s">I</a> think used to probably be well in excess of what we were offering for many of our extracurriculars. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1781.651s">And</a> it just may no longer be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1783.131s">So</a> we may need to take a look at that and figure out grant-wise where funding can come from to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1816.577s">Yeah,</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1817.537s">And</a> I would welcome a funding proposal or a recommendation or a request that we feel like would address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1826.202s">So</a> maybe we can take that up in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1828.283s">But</a> I think this is where, as the person who is the main stipend holder and knows the most about the grant and the funding available, we would welcome your recommendation about what is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1843.45s">and</a> perhaps there are other people in the community who might be willing to fund something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1847.191s">But</a> I think a recommendation from you would be very impactful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1854.494s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2249.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2249.841s">I</a> finally found the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2253.345s">So</a> I do recall at a school committee conference at 1 point in time that there were electrification programs out there that did require school districts to take ownership of the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2265.497s">And</a> then there was, like, a lease out of the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2268.3s">So</a> it wasn't necessarily like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2270.442s">A</a> contract issue, particularly, but it was like, we would own the buses and essentially lease them out to whoever is driving the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2279.136s">So</a> I think there's any number of ways that the electrification piece of this could happen and. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2285.866s">Obviously,</a> there's a lot of costs associated with the electrification of buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2289.449s">So</a> I'm sort of inclined to ask us to send this to subcommittee now so that when you're ready for that media discussion, like there's a place for that discussion to happen that can be dedicated to this, because obviously there's a lot of planning involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2305.123s">So</a> I'm sort of thinking about that, and I'm happy to make a motion to do that if my colleagues don't have other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2311.228s">But</a> I also... <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2313.51s">In</a> reading this report, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2319.173s">So</a> the bid, we would be entering into a three-year contract, and there would be options to extend that contract for one-year terms for a total of five years possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2330.457s">But</a> those are at our option at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2332.678s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2335.78s">And</a> we also only got one bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2339.902s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2345.18s">And</a> I just think I'm not really expecting that we have a big, huge audience here tonight on the last day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2351.782s">But</a> I think that's important to say out loud as much as we can, particularly on the heels of the year where we had to ask Eastern Bus to come visit us at school committee because they did not have enough drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2365.346s">So</a> our options are extraordinarily limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2370.228s">It's</a> not just a problem here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2372.008s">It's</a> a problem across the state that the Mass Association of School Committees has asked the legislature to take up in terms of increasing competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2380.471s">So</a> there's a lot going on in that space that does sort of limit our choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2387.692s">But</a> I am happy to see that we were really thoughtful in how we put this bid out so that we have options, including things like late buses, including things like add alternates for <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2399.936s">electrification,</a> et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2401.458s">So</a> I think we have a lot of options to leverage this contract in the bid that will serve us well for the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2409.647s">So</a> I'm also happy and I will make a motion now to accept the recommendation to approve the contract as described.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2490.192s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to refer the electrification of school buses and the report being prepared for the fall to the strategic and capital planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2501.158s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2837.875s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2839.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2840.956s">This</a> survey that you did, how did it, what were the results? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2844.618s">Like</a> how many people said, what percentage of respondents said, I would do this version if it was available versus people who said I would not do this version if it was available. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2856.203s">What</a> were the results?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2912.587s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2913.568s">Okay,</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2916.31s">That's</a> helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2917.739s">And</a> I do know that lots of people had feedback about that survey in terms of the nature of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2924.265s">And</a> I'm hopeful that the Afterschool Task Force can help us just get a little bit more precise on some of those communications before they go out in the future so that we're not causing agita. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2937.437s">We</a> were intending to ask a very simple question, and people got <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2941.14s">pretty</a> wrapped up around like, if I answer this the wrong way, am I going to lose my spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2946.79s">Which</a> was not our intention at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2948.413s">I</a> know that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2949.314s">So</a> I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2952.544s">I</a> do think I agree with Member Ruseau about the very, very low price. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2959.45s">And</a> I think one of the things we have to consider is that when we're offering this shorter version, there is stuff that is still just as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2970.259s">There's</a> just as much management. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2974.343s">There's</a> just as much payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2975.804s">Now</a> we have people who will be late. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2980.923s">Necessarily</a> like easy so easy to say it's 1 3rd of the work because there is still like, there's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2989.368s">Sort</a> of the fixed aspect of what this is going to look like to be able to support this program, which is like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=2996.653s">Adding</a> a layer of complication, I still think it's like a really good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3001.157s">I</a> just would like to see the price go up to be like, instead of just an even 3rd, like, I would, I would personally like to see it be about half of what full option is. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3013.513s">Because</a> I think there's a tremendous amount of work that is going to have to be done to manage this separate strand. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3023.078s">It's</a> not going to be completely seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3026.16s">And</a> I think we just need to account for that in terms of what our infrastructure is going to require to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3376.624s">How</a> many more students do we anticipate being able to admit under with this additional strand?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3442.178s">So</a> are you saying it's like an extra 26 kids per building? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3448.323s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3466.378s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3468.54s">But</a> this program will allow us to make a pretty big jump of 25-ish kids.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3502.722s">And</a> I think my other question is, this is a five-day option. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3507.709s">We're</a> not splitting that hair further to say there's two-day options and three-day options and four-day options, but this is just a five-day option. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3514.858s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3584.87s">I'm</a> comfortable with that as long as it's not like the complete Wild West times two, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3590.615s">I</a> think that's something that we're not ready for. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3594.898s">So</a> I think that feels perfectly fine to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3598.02s">I</a> think just circling back to the cost, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3602.836s">If</a> you all remember, the other thing we have really committed to is rapidly expanding our program after years of not making much progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3613.947s">So</a> I think what we will need administratively to make that happen is very unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3619.732s">And</a> we're going to layer on top of that this new strand. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3623.875s">So</a> I think we should be conservative in terms of what it takes to make sure we do this well, rather than come up short, where we then have criticism that the program would have, could have, should have done something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3638.806s">And</a> if we find that all of that comes together very seamlessly, I think then we have the option next year to say, we're not going to increase that rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3648.173s">But</a> I think if we come in too low, we will own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3654.679s">And</a> all of the criticism that comes with short-changing the operational need, potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3660.104s">So</a> I'm going to make a motion that the daily rate be $15 for this till 4 PM option. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3666.21s">And</a> yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4749.807s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4754.047s">I</a> really like the lease option, particularly because it also includes maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4760.032s">And</a> we know that we haven't always done such a great job when it comes to maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4765.595s">And</a> I think those fillable water stations are a really good example of us not doing maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4771.48s">The</a> filters are clogged. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4773.921s">My</a> kids come home all the time and say those don't work anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4777.103s">There's</a> a sign over them that says don't use. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4781.945s">All</a> of that goes away with this model, which I think is super intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4787.589s">Noel,</a> I did have one other question, which was, is this being funded out of the food service budget, or is this being funded out of the operating budget?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4834.506s">And</a> that's the plan for these pieces, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4838.933s">And</a> so the budget can handle this expense, is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4842.675s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4848.818s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=4849.858s">I</a> will make a motion to approve the five-year lease and defer to my colleagues.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5090.046s">Mayor,</a> I can give a brief summary of the administrator's contract, if that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5095.788s">That'd</a> be great, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5099.067s">We</a> met in executive session and did take a vote to ratify the contract, but in just going through the notes, we didn't report that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5111.195s">So</a> we do need to take a vote here on the floor according to our attorney and just by way of what that contract is. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5120.281s">It's</a> a 3-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5123.743s">In</a> FY25, the increase is 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5124.283s">In</a> FY26, it's 2.5% plus a 0.75% wage adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5126.545s">And</a> the same in FY27, 2.5% plus a 0.75% wage adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5128.486s">And</a> that is because <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5143.013s">With</a> the sort of big and big changes to the teacher salaries, we were at risk of our administrative positions no longer being very attractive. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5154.928s">So</a> we had to make some adjustments there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5157.611s">This</a> contract also. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5160.195s">made</a> some changes, did not make any changes to their longevity, but did make some changes to the wage schedules around their advanced degrees, which they have in their contract really in lieu of steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5176.275s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5178.698s">Although</a> longevity did change by $100 per contract year, which was very modest. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5183.902s">And</a> there were a couple of big things that came out of this, one of which was that their work year will be increased by two days in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5198.172s">So</a> part of their increase is because they will be working more. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5202.475s">And</a> our stipends, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5206.217s">We</a> had some short term stipends to support some of the schedule work as well as some continuing stipends that will continue to be part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5216.102s">And</a> then the, the final piece was that the director of English language. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5224.309s">uh,</a> learners, um, what would no longer be part of the unit, given the changing nature of that role and the alignment of that role more to our director of pupil services than to the work that's being done in that unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5238.413s">Um,</a> so that's like a quick recap and, um, attorney Greenspan suggested that we, um, take a vote in public to, um, acknowledge, um, that and, uh, be able to execute the full conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5253.658s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5277.042s">Just</a> like we did in the teacher's contract, there is a per day adjustment, which is in addition to the COLAs.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5362.257s">Mayor,</a> can I just clarify, did we, that vote was just about the administrator's contract or it was about all three? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5369.84s">Just</a> the administrators, I'm seeing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=5374.822s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6093.428s">My</a> house is not on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6096.549s">There</a> is a pie that might have been on fire, but it's all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6100.13s">And</a> we're all good here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6103.271s">But</a> I did want to say that I think threading the needle between valuing the employees that you have and rewarding people for doing hard work and stepping up and <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6117.511s">What</a> looks like transparency by posting positions is a needle to be threaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6122.854s">I</a> don't think there's one answer to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6125.775s">I</a> think when you get in the habit of posting positions, when you know who's right for the job, it diminishes the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6132.458s">And</a> it leads to what we see in Medford Public Schools, where everyone is just convinced that the job is posted as a cover to give somebody's family member <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6142.603s">a</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6143.283s">So</a> I think it's not, to me, it's a very gray area in terms of hiring and leading. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6149.425s">And</a> I just want to offer that every time I talk to somebody about how positions are posted, they're like, the feedback that I hear is, well, that's just done so that there's cover to give somebody a job that they don't deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6164.19s">And</a> I think we've worked really hard to change that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6167.831s">And</a> I appreciate that it's not perfect all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6171.692s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6486.066s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6486.667s">Wait,</a> wait, wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6487.707s">Can</a> I ask a question first? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6491.009s">I</a> just, oh, sorry, to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6492.789s">Yes,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6495.011s">Just</a> like, wait, that's not what I meant.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6500.093s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6550.436s">I</a> was just hoping somebody could give us some background on this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6553.739s">Like,</a> did it exist before? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6555.82s">Is</a> it changing in some way? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6557.442s">Like,</a> what is the, like, backstory of it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6695.801s">Thank</a> you for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6700.451s">I</a> think my other question, so I have another question, which is, who provided input to this policy as it's currently drafted?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6771.738s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6772.478s">I,</a> I agree that it is very thoughtful in terms of laying out best practice, but I think there are some policy questions that need to be answered that we're not going to answer tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6786.287s">And</a> some of the things on my mind are that we are imposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6792.582s">Requirements</a> on people that are not really required to follow our policy, like, and I think everyone in good spirit wants to obviously work collaboratively together, but to write a policy where we can't really govern enforcement is challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6810.148s">I</a> would also be very interested to hear from some of our athletic coaches, because they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6817.267s">They</a> have a very unique perspective on this and the other thing that is on my mind is when we talk about the responsibilities of various people in this process, like, there are, we have labor bargaining agreements and job descriptions for all of these roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6834.837s">And</a> so I do think we need to take some time to say whether what we have outlined here sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6841.301s">Is</a> in conflict in some way, because there may be some bargaining issues that come out of this that we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6849.008s">To</a> do, and I, I appreciate the best practice guide, but I am, I felt like the policy part of it got a little bit lost in the sauce because this is so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6862.018s">So,</a> I am wondering if there is sort of a. A different way to put this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6870.105s">So</a> those are I'll defer to my colleagues, but as somebody with a life threatening allergy, I appreciate the thoughtfulness here, but I would personally like to see the policy guidance be. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6884.831s">Maybe</a> more precise and potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6889.353s">more</a> targeted at different educational levels, because I think what happens and what we would expect in an elementary school and what happens and what we would expect in a high school could be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6901.395s">And</a> I just would want to have that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6903.115s">So</a> I do have some questions about how can we make this more clear and concise from a policy perspective, and how do we let that work in tandem with the best practices that are here and not run afoul of our union contracts and all of those other things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7941.09s">Um,</a> yeah, and I think when we talk about this in subcommittee, I would want to make sure that we're inviting people in because. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7948.235s">I,</a> I watched this happen in real time where Avery threw down the hammer about allergies and the reaction from the PTO was like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7961.584s">What</a> we're just trying to do a good thing here and now you're you have, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7966.417s">at</a> the very last minute you have ruined this plan and we have no alternative and there's no help for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7972.227s">So</a> I just don't want this policy to become a reason for PTOs to feel <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7979.857s">like</a> they should disengage because I don't think we want that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7982.878s">And</a> I don't think that's the spirit or the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7986.038s">So</a> I do want the Rules and Policy Committee to invite coaches and PTOs in particular to talk through, like, what are the things that, like, what are the rules of engagement? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7998.66s">Because</a> if we're talking about just the school day, then a bake sale is probably not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8002.501s">But</a> this, as written, talks about how bake sales should happen <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8007.822s">And</a> that generally is outside of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8009.923s">So</a> I just want their heads at the table so that we can collaborate on something that doesn't feel like we're imposing something that is insurmountable on them because I don't think this is insurmountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8024.49s">But</a> I think if you were handed a 20 something page policy like <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8029.125s">it</a> would be real easy to sort of feel overwhelmed by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8032.468s">And</a> I just don't want that to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8033.749s">So</a> I think we can have some thoughtful discussion in subcommittee to make sure that this policy doesn't become a scapegoat on its own, because that's nobody's intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8043.957s">And</a> I think they will have real problems of practice to bring to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8049.922s">And</a> a lot of, I think, good can come of that conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8121.519s">I</a> would just ask that we make sure we're not running afoul of our union contracts and changes in working condition and particularly tread lightly with our PTOs so that we don't create a problem for the subcommittee to have to unwind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8364.265s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8366.047s">I</a> did have, I had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8369.509s">I</a> don't think we can really answer them tonight, but there were a number of things listed in here around costs and fundraising associated with field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8379.195s">And</a> I know that we have a pending item in the rules and policy subcommittee that is related around district reimbursement of, let's call it like, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8396.419s">next</a> level events like championship events or like finals kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8400.8s">Like</a> I made the playoffs kinds of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8405.021s">And</a> we, I know the rules and policy subcommittee meeting had to postpone that meeting in part because of my schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8413.263s">So</a> my apologies, but I feel like it would be wise for us to review this and the fundraising aspects of this policy, like at the same time, as we're talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8425.599s">funding</a> and fundraising for field trips, essentially, is what they boil down to, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8431.28s">And</a> just a couple of things that flagged, again, were around PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8436.081s">And,</a> like, for example, it says, under no circumstances should private cash transfer applications be utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8442.142s">Well,</a> our PTOs have, like, legitimate setups in, like, Venmo and other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8449.304s">So</a> if we're saying they can't do that, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8452.242s">then</a> that's like a consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8453.843s">I</a> think we just need to play out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8456.004s">Um,</a> so I do think there are some like fundraising, um, components of this policy that I want to spend a little bit more time on. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8463.667s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that this also go to the rules and policy subcommittee for, um, review before it comes back.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8672.824s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8709.773s">I</a> mean, as I read this, I don't think any of this applies or is relevant anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8718.215s">And</a> I think the whole thing could be rescinded in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8721.198s">So</a> I would just make a motion to rescind this policy and be done with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8725.723s">We've</a> done so much work to IKF. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8727.686s">There's</a> nothing here that needs to be integrated in any way that I can see, because I think we've more than covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8736.595s">And</a> frankly, we haven't been using this policy in probably forever anyway.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9542.426s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9544.732s">A</a> couple things, I think 1 of the things that members I was talking about is we got an update on the H back projects at the McGlynn and the Andrews and related to those 2 projects upgrades have to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9559.456s">And</a> so the settling of the Plaza in the front are upgrades that will be made in tandem with those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9568.098s">And</a> they're slated, I believe, for this summer, so we should be able to take care of that immediate issue that you were citing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9574.921s">But</a> the other thing that came up in the course of that conversation was that there was a much bigger list of ADA issues outlined and. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9583.085s">there</a> were certain things like moving sinks an inch that the team that is working on the HVAC project was going to apply for variances for. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9592.873s">So</a> certainly I think we could ask to get a copy of what that recommendation was or what those variances were so that we understand what's happening in those two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9602.08s">I</a> think the report, Mayor, that you're talking about, was that the one that was like wildly complicated to submit <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9610.842s">Yes,</a> okay, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9612.583s">I'm</a> glad we got it in this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9614.083s">Yes,</a> we got it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9615.984s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9618.165s">But</a> that certainly will help and sort of open the door for work in some of our other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9625.528s">The</a> other thing that we talked about when we were talking about the list of variances for McGlynn and Andrews is when we decide what those variances are, we need to catalog those things in our <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9639.834s">Our</a> ticketing system so that if for some reason we have to replace a sink, that we replace it in the new compliant way versus the way we've always done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9652.118s">And</a> so there is a maintenance buildings and grounds ongoing tail that can hopefully, and in a much lower cost way, remediate those things as we are doing other maintenance related items to those <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9664.942s">wherever</a> those variances might sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9666.602s">Like,</a> if you have to put in a new door, can you make it an inch wider? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9670.563s">Kind</a> of question that I think we need our teams to be asking themselves when they're handling things that seem routine, given the state of how things have changed with the ADA. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9682.366s">So</a> I think that's an important question and an ask for our buildings and grounds and our facilities team. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9689.222s">And</a> then the last thing I'll say is that we have been doing some facilities assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9693.246s">I</a> think that's the other thing that we have been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9696.869s">And</a> I believe those reports are coming back and there probably are any number of things already cataloged in that assessment that would outline this, but we can check on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9707.959s">So</a> we may not have to do something new to get those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9712.884s">what</a> we may need to do is like prioritize those things into our capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9718.428s">But</a> we can check, I can check, Jerry was just mentioning it to me today about what, about that those reports were starting to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9726.013s">So</a> we may just want to think about that as another place where some of this data may already exist.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10323.672s">That</a> I'll do my best.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10429.509s">Just</a> quickly, I'm totally flexible on the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10432.431s">Like</a> if you need more time than this, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10434.612s">I</a> just, there's been a lot going on and I think we saw like several really lackluster versions of this report a year or so ago at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10446.798s">And</a> it just struck me that, like, A, that this trying to get on a school year schedule of, like, reporting for the school year made a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10456.606s">And</a> my particular interest is when we are talking about things happening at different levels that we are actually having conversation about things that are happening differently in different school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10468.775s">And</a> I think there's, I've heard people say our suspensions are back to where they were when we started all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10475.621s">which</a> I think, you know, I don't think anyone's, like, lying about that necessarily, but I think that data needs to be, like, proved out. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10486.47s">So</a> I would like for us to have a discussion on what those facts are rather than, like, the anecdotal, like, it seems like a lot of kids are getting suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10496.098s">So</a> I just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10497.899s">Um,</a> like, lay this out and specifically point out that, like, the, the big difference I see, and what I'm looking for out of this is that we are going to look at and compare by school and by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10510.973s">What's</a> happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10511.613s">Because</a> if there are like, hot spots or flashes of. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10515.597s">something</a> really discrepant happening, that is a conversation that we should be having from a policy perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10523.202s">So</a> I'm hoping that October 31st makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10528.106s">But</a> if you need more time, I'm totally open to that, too.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10631.97s">I</a> don't think so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10643.603s">I'll</a> double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10644.964s">I'm</a> not planning to be at a meeting on Monday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10646.805s">So</a> maybe I just don't know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10688.882s">Just</a> the overfilling burned, but I think the pie was rescued. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10695.077s">What</a> kind of pie is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10697.122s">Strawberry</a> rhubarb. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10700.309s">Sounds</a> good.<h2><a href="../2025-06-11_VUGwCJcKl8M/2025-06-11_VUGwCJcKl8M.html">FE&C SubCommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=121.724s">All</a> right, I'm going to read the meeting agenda.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=137.376s">I'm</a> going to start reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=138.057s">Dr.</a> Lucy is signing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=139.378s">She's</a> sitting right next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=140.438s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=142.58s">Where</a> did I put it? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=147.603s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=147.983s">Okay,</a> please be advised that on Wednesday, June 11th at 530, there'll be a family and community engagement subcommittee meeting held through participation via zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=160.616s">This</a> meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=161.837s">The</a> meeting can be viewed live on Medford public schools, YouTube channel through Medford community media on your local cable, which is Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=171.381s">98</a> or 22 and Verizon 4543 or 47 since the meeting will be held remotely participants can log in by using the following link or call in number meeting ID for zoom is 97829828875. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=187.285s">Questions</a> or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=194.475s">and</a> you must include the following, your first and last name, your Medford street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=200.237s">So</a> I will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=202.277s">Member</a> Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=203.397s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=204.938s">Member</a> Intoppa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=207.439s">And</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=209.639s">Hi,</a> that's me. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=211.0s">Three</a> present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=213.78s">Okay,</a> so I will say that many of the people on this call have a hard stop at 6.30 because we have a school building committee meeting right after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=224.143s">because</a> there just aren't enough hours in the month of June, apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=228.305s">But</a> we are here because Member Reinfeld sent forth and received approval for a resolution that says, be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communication Subcommittee will need to discuss protocols for family-facing communications around after-school enrollment and academic transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=246.852s">This</a> meeting will include the director of communications as well as relevant programs, program directors and school leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=253.939s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=255.695s">Um,</a> what we wanted to do was start with a discussion of, like, our current protocols and just so that we can sort of hear what the district is currently doing across these different transition points. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=270.068s">Um,</a> and then see if there's any public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=274.472s">Oh,</a> there you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=275.212s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=275.493s">I</a> just hung up on myself and then talk about, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=280.995s">Suggestions</a> for next steps and communication plans that might smooth out some of these transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=287.823s">So,</a> before I continue member, I felt, did you have anything else you wanted to say to lead us off?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=391.944s">So,</a> on the hit parade of transitions to discuss, the first one from a current protocol perspective is kindergarten registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=401.666s">And</a> I know there's been a lot of change in how we communicate about kindergarten in the last, like, handful of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=408.467s">That</a> warms my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=409.348s">So,</a> I was hoping somebody could maybe start with kindergarten registration, and then we can just, like, run down the list of, like, current practice.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=563.197s">And</a> how much earlier are you seeing the numbers come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=566.624s">Like,</a> do you have like a comparison?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=974.47s">Is</a> there like a one page like here's what you can expect for the year kind of document that we could like <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=985.26s">give</a> to the particularly the local preschools at the beginning of the year so that there's like a timeline like here's when you should think about registering your kid and here's like when there will be an open house so that people aren't like bombarding the school like I want to come take a tour right like I'm just thinking about like the active marketing that happens particularly from the charter schools to get kids into their pipeline in kindergarten <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1013.117s">And</a> even though we're starting in November, like, there are definitely families starting before November to try to understand what their options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1023.661s">So</a> if there was a way for us to, like, give them a, like, one-page roadmap of, like, here's what happens in the next year on your way to Medford Public Schools, and it's just this easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1037.242s">With</a> a little bit of information that helps people feel good, like, could something like that obviously could go on our website and it can go on our social media pages and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1046.207s">But</a> could something like that also be useful to hand to the preschool so they can pass them out to their kids so that parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1057.357s">can</a> just like be prepared, like, oh, I have to register my kid and I can do that starting in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1062.899s">Cause</a> there's always somebody who's like, when do I register my kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1065.599s">Or</a> when is the first day for kindergarten? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1068.62s">Or</a> like, is there an open house? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1070.801s">And</a> like, you know, all those dates, those dates all exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1073.502s">Like,</a> well, you know, well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1075.542s">So</a> I think that would be sort of an interesting experiment too, to just try to create like a one page of like, here's what it looks like.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1115.421s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1115.681s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1116.822s">That's</a> that's an easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1118.863s">I</a> don't see a whole slew of community members on, but does anybody else have anything they want to add before we move on from kindergarten?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1139.555s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1140.176s">After</a> school enrollment and lottery.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1300.904s">And</a> I think, you know, I'd be interested in what the task force has to say to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1304.685s">And</a> maybe we can simply defer to them on after school for this, the purposes of this meeting, but maybe like, you know, again, like a one pager, like, here's how after school works, which I know it does change all the time, but the same kind of thing, like, here's the lottery, here's how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1321.932s">Because,</a> you know, we've had, I've had people say, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1326.932s">well,</a> they don't tell me where I am in the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1328.954s">And</a> I'm like, well, that's because we asked them not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1334.098s">And</a> that's because people were badgering our staff who have to take care of kids and we needed them to be able to focus on taking care of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1342.746s">So</a> I think there's, you know, a lot of like transition happening there, but maybe something like in a one page kind of format, again, like pretty early in the game so that if anyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1353.952s">whenever</a> you sort of think like, oh my God, I have to find afterschool for my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1358.494s">Like</a> there's some like simple way to understand how the process works would probably be very helpful, but I totally defer to what the task force has to say about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1371.32s">All</a> right, well, why don't we move on to transition from elementary to middle school?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1774.99s">For</a> middle school, yeah, I mean, I think again, like, something early in the year that says. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1781.832s">You</a> have a fifth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1783.213s">That's</a> great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1784.675s">There's</a> all kinds of things that are going to happen between now and the time they transition to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1789.379s">And</a> this is what you can expect from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1793.103s">Again,</a> I think if parents are thinking about going elsewhere for middle school, they're thinking about that in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1801.49s">And</a> the first opportunity to go see our middle schools officially is like May. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1807.134s">So</a> I think, you know, when you were saying you give a lot of individual tours, I guess my other question is, is there a way to have some sort of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1817.168s">Combined</a> tour night between the 2 schools where you talk about, like, middle school in a general way, the curriculum, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1829.376s">So</a> that people who are interested in that piece of it early, like, October ish. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1836.873s">have</a> a place to go to get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1838.895s">And</a> maybe some of those, you know, families that you are entertaining on an individualized basis might even appreciate coming to something like that because they're likely to know other people in the community with kids their age, even if they don't go to school with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1854.807s">And</a> if you show up and your friends are there and they're like, oh yeah, you know, my oldest went to this school or whatever, like there's some like cross-pollination that could be productive there that <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1866.796s">I</a> think maybe would be very helpful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1871.454s">I</a> do remember world language being, like, basically the only choice, right, that you have on the way into middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1880.921s">And</a> I don't remember really learning about it, and this may have changed because it's been a couple of years, but, like, I don't remember learning about, like, did you get your choice or not until, like, schedules came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1893.792s">Is</a> that still the case? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1895.473s">And</a> do you get a lot of questions about that outside of, like, when the schedule comes out?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1948.712s">Yeah,</a> I think that's well, my kids were on the front end of the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1954.216s">So</a> we weren't the very first lottery class, but we were pretty early in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1961.481s">And</a> those meetings were packed because it was new. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1964.603s">And</a> now it's what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1966.864s">So</a> I think it's a completely different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1969.666s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1970.006s">I'm</a> not even sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1970.786s">I</a> think like a meeting about the lottery, if we can message it more proactively, is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1977.768s">Like</a> if you're going to have a meeting about middle school, like I would have a meeting about middle school, not about the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1985.05s">And</a> if you're going to talk about the lottery, you should just make people aware that if they watch the lottery, there's like nothing to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1990.971s">Because</a> I think people think there's something to see and they think they're going to learn <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1995.112s">on</a> screen where their kid is going, and none of that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=1998.355s">And</a> so you just watch a bunch of people, like, passing papers around, and it's, like, sort of the craziest half hour of television of the day, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2007.923s">So</a> it's just like, it had—things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2011.586s">Like,</a> that has settled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2012.847s">That</a> is a process that people are familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2014.808s">So</a> I think we can embrace that and not necessarily have to keep having those meetings that people seem not as interested in anymore.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2043.957s">So</a> even if there could be something in the fall, and maybe then there's a Zoom, you probably could hit up a bunch of different parents and a bunch of different questions with a similar program.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2185.887s">All</a> right, moving right along, middle to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2191.091s">So</a> you have two middle to high school parents here with you today.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2479.521s">I</a> feel like you've been here a lot longer than that, Marta. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2481.902s">I</a> know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2487.386s">So</a> I will say that there's a million missed opportunities in the open house. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2493.549s">So</a> I've been to several of them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2496.331s">And</a> I think the vocational teams do a really great job of showcasing their students and their programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2507.938s">And</a> so any parent that is like wandering into any of those places is getting like a pretty lovely experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2516.922s">But</a> if you come with questions about academics, like your takeaway is this is not the place for my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2525.025s">It's</a> really lackluster on the academic side. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2528.046s">And</a> I know that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2531.496s">it's</a> easier to be excited to see something, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2534.899s">Like</a> here's this thing that the kids built, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2539.103s">Like</a> here's this car that they're fixing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2542.326s">Here's</a> this web, like the, the vocational side of, um, the house has like all the benefits in the world of having tangible things that people can see and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2556.701s">Touch</a> and feel in some cases, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2559.402s">That</a> makes that experience really engaging, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2564.805s">There</a> we aren't the 1st school to have an open house about academics and we can certainly do better than we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2572.749s">I</a> mean, a few years ago, I'm happy to share that email with you, but a few years ago, after Lila went through it, I sent a. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2579.975s">really</a> scathing email about how mortified I was at the experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2586.68s">And</a> it's fine, like, it wasn't the end of the world, but it was like, there were just so many opportunities where we just didn't put our best foot forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2596.166s">And</a> that was before your time, Marta. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2597.867s">So,</a> but I imagine like there's some good nuggets in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2603.111s">And</a> I think it's the first, that is like the timing is just right for parents who are thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2608.878s">You</a> know, where they want to send their kid to high school and, like, we've just got this, like, golden opportunity and then we basically give everyone a map and tell them to go wander a giant building.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2643.172s">True.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2679.981s">I</a> thought, I could be wrong because negotiations were <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2684.235s">wild</a> and crazy, but I did think that something shifted in the night event. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2692.164s">But</a> I'll go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2693.345s">We're</a> moving forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2698.491s">I</a> think it was on the 10th, but I don't know where we landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2702.095s">Yeah,</a> it was definitely discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2705.582s">Hotly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2706.562s">At</a> various points of time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2732.394s">Yeah,</a> and I think there's amazing things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2735.562s">everywhere,</a> world language, everywhere in the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2739.143s">There's</a> so many amazing things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2741.584s">It's</a> just so unfortunate that we don't get to really show that off to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2746.265s">So</a> I think that's a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2748.606s">And</a> then I definitely would say, I still don't know what's going on with Lucas's schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2754.708s">He</a> came home and told me he picked something. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2756.388s">And</a> I was like, why did you pick that? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2757.729s">He's</a> like, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2759.469s">And</a> I'm still completely unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2762.651s">Is</a> there another round of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2765.954s">Is</a> there not another round of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2767.455s">So</a> I completely support the idea of kids having a front row seat to how this is supposed to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2776.901s">But</a> I think we need to tell parents that that is what's happening proactively. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2781.584s">Again,</a> here's the roadmap to going to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2784.426s">This</a> is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2786.188s">You're</a> going to get to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2788.496s">this</a> is how it gets finalized, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2792.417s">Here's</a> the dates and all those good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2794.138s">Like</a> same thing, like what is that pathway that you can expect from us? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2797.639s">But</a> from a scheduling perspective, I'm still personally like very unclear if his schedule is done or not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2806.782s">Yeah,</a> I would echo that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2981.466s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2983.167s">And</a> I will say like the messaging from the high school has never been like entirely on point. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2990.211s">Like</a> when it, what I remember when Lila was going from eighth to ninth grade was <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2996.207s">You</a> have to make these selections. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2997.588s">You</a> have to make all these selections. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=2999.009s">You</a> have to make your course selections. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3001.05s">And</a> in the choices of anything, it was her choices were like, are you going in honors or CP? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3008.916s">That</a> was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3009.436s">Because</a> her year, everyone did the CTE. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3012.659s">So</a> you weren't choosing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3015.22s">You</a> weren't choosing to go to gym or health. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3017.522s">You</a> were literally choosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3019.457s">like</a> which version of the required class you were taking which was fine but I was like it was billed as like you have to make all of these selections and this is really important and I was like there's not <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3032.421s">you're</a> making it sound like there's choices here and there aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3034.921s">So</a> I do think if the high school has the parent advisory council or whatever they're called, there just might be some people willing to help pre-read some of these things to say, does this hit what parents are asking about right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3053.145s">Because</a> I feel like particularly around these transition points, it's really easy to get <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3061.322s">stuck</a> in, like, on thinking everyone knows your language when they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3065.303s">Like,</a> because not only do they not speak school, but they also don't speak high school because they only have a middle schooler. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3070.105s">So</a> I think particularly in that transition, there might be some opportunity to ask people to help with that messaging in advance in some way that could just settle it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3081.528s">And</a> I also think, Marta, if you want <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3086.757s">help</a> or support from families around, like, the course selection night or open house in terms of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3094.361s">Like,</a> there's—I could think of, like, five or six people who would be more than happy to, like, have a meeting so that you're hearing that perspective from more than just me and Erica and John, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3107.206s">But</a> that's also a possibility because I think there's plenty of parents that would be willing to help.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3204.004s">Yeah,</a> if you if there's folks that you want to chat with, just I'm happy to send some people your way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3212.755s">And</a> then the last thing on our list was end of year school happenings and events.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3638.942s">Yeah,</a> perfectly fair.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3664.699s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3665.493s">Okay,</a> I think we made it to the end of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3668.715s">Thank</a> you all for indulging.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3676.879s">We</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3678.0s">Are</a> there any other comments from the group? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3684.483s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3689.385s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3693.28s">And</a> also adjourned by a member and Tapa seconded by a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3695.948s">I'll</a> call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3697.212s">Um,</a> Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3698.776s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3699.198s">John</a> and Tapa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3701.444s">Erica</a> Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3702.467s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3702.728s">3</a> in the affirmative 0 on the negative meeting is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3705.777s">We'll</a> see you all.<h2><a href="../2025-06-11_eVGy96zbLTU/2025-06-11_eVGy96zbLTU.html">MCHSBC Full Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=0.771s">while</a> blocking off and keeping students safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2.693s">So</a> I would say student safety isn't really the concern when we're preparing sites because that is a given across all of our sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=15.14s">There</a> might be a little more planning that goes into the logistics of the phasing to make sure that everything works well and goes smoothly during construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=28.748s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=30.176s">That,</a> and I just want to be clear that we can also put together kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=36.058s">You</a> know, we can put together this in frozen ponds about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=40.319s">You</a> know, looking at these sites and the advantages and disadvantages if that is helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=46.501s">But</a> I don't think that there is that trade off with student safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=50.862s">1</a> way or the other.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=98.268s">And</a> it's just in Medford Square, when we made this, like, sort of decision to put it into the conversation, and RFP hadn't yet been released for the city on parcel, it now has, project's been awarded, there's a whole, like, revitalization plan happening that is, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=116.607s">you</a> know, that train is moving down the track faster than our study is able to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=121.331s">So</a> that is another consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=123.513s">So</a> I think Medford Square is like not an option anymore for that reason.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=149.172s">Yes,</a> that's absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=151.613s">And</a> I will say, I think what left, especially for Columbus Park, this site right that we're on right now is almost 30 acres. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=158.556s">Columbus</a> Park was five acres, just for, you know, in perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=193.998s">We</a> certainly do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=196.1s">The</a> meeting, the meeting was reported that we had at that time and it was, it is available on the YouTube channel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=204.467s">So</a> if people want to go back and watch that meeting, they certainly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=207.049s">I'm</a> going to take a couple of questions from Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=211.713s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=262.167s">Yes,</a> I would say that by taking the other options off the table, especially if they don't seem as viable, we are able to take more time to study more options on this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=275.423s">The</a> MSBA requires us to at least study a code upgrade only. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=279.965s">Renovation,</a> we'll have renovation addition options and we'll have a full new construction so that there will be a number of options on this site that will be studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=290.269s">So</a> that it's not just us putting, not just the project team saying this is your one solution on this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=297.332s">That</a> is the process that MSBA takes you through to make sure that you have looked at all of the options.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=399.18s">Is</a> that, is that something that the left field team may be able to help us with, like from a like, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=405.81s">sort</a> of roughed all kind of assessment to say like really, you know, if we look at these sites and we can, we can point you to the direction of that meeting that was recorded and some of those sites it certainly I'm sure Director Hunt would be happy to chat with you, but even just some sort of a chart of like, here's all the sites that are like even possible and here's the Bedford and here's what they, here's what they look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=433.419s">And,</a> you know, from your <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=435.311s">Perspective,</a> are they viable? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=436.652s">Yes</a> or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=437.813s">So</a> that when we rule them out, like, we're, we're doing that with a record of a recommendation of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=444.558s">Is</a> that helpful? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=446.019s">And</a> by the spoiler, we're going to have a little bit of free time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=448.661s">So</a> you might be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=451.843s">Without</a> really changing the trajectory of the rest of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=455.826s">Absolutely,</a> we would love to do that and I think that would be a really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=460.55s">Good</a> thing to do to your point of. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=462.871s">Proving</a> to the community that these are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=465.83s">Options</a> that we looked at, but we'll have actual reasons to back up why they don't work and it'll be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=471.954s">It'll</a> be in a document that provided pointed to, especially when you guys do come to a consensus on a single option. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=479.358s">A</a> lot of people at that point will ask, well, what about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=482.14s">What</a> about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=482.6s">What</a> it will have? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=483.861s">The</a> process laid out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=615.416s">I</a> think that's maybe another point about this site and a different site that would be worth understanding for all of us, that if we were to use a different site, how would that affect the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=630.665s">Absolutely,</a> so the MSBA, there are certain spaces and certain guidelines of space allotment in spaces that the MSBA deems eligible costs, which means they will participate in funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=647.652s">They</a> will not participate in funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=650.273s">An</a> option, if you do stay on this site, is to renovate the whole area and separate that portion of the building and <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=658.989s">you</a> know, create maybe a mostly new building with that as a renovated portion so that the cost of keeping the pool isn't as significant as building a new pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=670.357s">You</a> could, you do have the option to, to build a new pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=675.501s">It</a> would completely be on the City of Bedford's dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=679.484s">But,</a> and that's something that you'd have to work through, especially with the community to make sure they understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=684.247s">You</a> can renovate with, as part of the.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=734.754s">Dr.</a> Cushing, did you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=736.214s">I</a> thought I saw Dr. Cushing's hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=737.615s">I</a> just didn't want to distract.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=742.843s">Did</a> you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=744.485s">No,</a> more just having worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=751.71s">We</a> lost you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=754.232s">Oh,</a> are we literally losing? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=757.794s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=758.775s">Now</a> that he's speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=760.996s">He'll</a> be back.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=827.768s">I</a> was going to say, it's a field house. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=831.229s">They</a> allow up to 12,000 square feet for a high school for gyms, but that would be a conversation and we'll get into it in a little bit, but we're going to be working on an educational plan for the school and laying out spaces that are required, programs that use those spaces and usage rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=851.873s">is</a> all going to kind of factor into having that discussion with the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=855.414s">Another</a> option, like the pool, if it's in good shape to keep, it might be worth renovating instead of building new in that case. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=864.817s">We'll</a> take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=865.517s">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=866.518s">As</a> someone who didn't go to this high school, are the pool locker rooms separate from the field house locker rooms, or are they shared? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=871.699s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=872.099s">So</a> in theory, because I'm thinking from my knowledge of Durfee, if you were to renovate the pool, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=880.493s">Like</a> would it, you could then make a multi-use locker room, like so you're not then like paying for it, like renovating the pool and paying for a new pool locker room, like in theory, is that something that could happen?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=955.465s">So,</a> so I guess I think that's a good question for just for us to understand, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=960.892s">if</a> we were to ask you all to help us build that chart, whatever it is, chart, one pager, like I've talked about a lot of one pagers today, so I'll just call it that for lack of a better term. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=971.579s">But</a> if we were to do that, is that in the scope of your current services as our OPM? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=977.463s">Yes,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1014.143s">Yes,</a> we did have that conversation, but we did have that conversation so I think that would be a great meeting to go rewatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1022.413s">Director</a> Hunt was really insightful about that while Columbus Park is not unlike this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1032.998s">It</a> does, it could move the school to an economically disadvantaged area and provide access to people who lack that access to our high school today on foot, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1045.624s">So</a> there is value to looking at that site from that perspective, but it is one sixth the size of this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1053.028s">If</a> we would be making real trade-offs, pool, playing fields, we'd probably have like a five-story high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1061.151s">There</a> would be no parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1062.915s">all</a> the things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1063.795s">So</a> I think it is a good, we had that, we actually did have a detailed conversation about like, where are those places? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1072.179s">That's</a> why we talked about like the Andrews-McLinton complex, because that could serve that purpose, but the complexities of that, and frankly, the cost of doing a swap is like exponentially like outside of this VA is going to entertain for reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1092.227s">So</a> that <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1093.163s">made</a> it sort of not on the list, but to your point, like we know what those sites are that the community talks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1100.145s">So</a> I don't think it would be that hard for them to put together something that just provides those talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1107.548s">So</a> when people say, but did you ever consider like, yes, we, we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1111.969s">And</a> we did that multiple steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1113.51s">We</a> did that as a group a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1115.811s">We</a> did it when we signed off unanimously on our education profile, we're going to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1120.686s">Here,</a> but what we're not going to do is a design study that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1124.268s">Spends</a> money, putting a building together on a property that is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1128.952s">So</a> I feel like this is this is part of why we have an. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1132.854s">Use</a> our services to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1134.956s">That</a> might make sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1153.887s">Medford</a> does not have lots of free space. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1156.188s">So</a> there were very few options essentially that would like there's very few pieces of big swaths of property that Medford has. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1166.911s">So</a> there's just only a handful of choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1169.671s">So</a> that's sort of how it was identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1173.612s">And</a> sort of similarly, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1176.475s">Medford</a> Square being fairly undeveloped right now is how it got identified and certainly there's huge value from a planners perspective and Alicia talks a lot about this meeting like there's huge value from a planner's perspective to putting a high school like near the middle of the city right like there's just tons of economic advantage to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1198.398s">However,</a> there's a lot of economic advantage to the current proposal that is like moving forward too. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1203.282s">So</a> again, like the timing of saying that's part of why we put Medford Square on the list because it is the middle, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1210.548s">Like</a> for all intents and purposes of the city, it would increase access to lots of people, but you would be trading or playing fields on profit and all those other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1221.596s">The</a> city has moved forward in sort of a different direction since then, which is just sort of what happens <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1227.14s">When</a> there's, you know, these press are a bit longer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1231.321s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1257.11s">Well,</a> just scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1258.191s">Yeah,</a> that's good.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1273.383s">They're</a> listening to our meeting right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1344.126s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1345.769s">It</a> was a very cursory discussion of like, what even are the places that are big enough for us to entertain?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1363.363s">So</a> if you were taking that away, you would be taking away space from the Mistletoe.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1436.013s">Well,</a> I think that is a simplistic view of the space because education has changed dramatically since the 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1444.979s">And</a> our vocational spaces have <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1447.773s">ignorantly</a> different space requirements than classrooms do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1451.175s">So</a> I can't wait actually to find out how big the high school should be, because I think there's a lot of opinions about how the building's going to be half the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1461.38s">And</a> I think there will be facts about that soon enough.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1497.12s">That</a> is definitely going to be something that is considered, especially when the architect is brought on, because they will be able to analyze what spaces you have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1505.923s">How</a> that, how that applies against that guidelines and see how much space you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1512.304s">And</a> then obviously discussions with the school on what spaces would be to stay in a phased construction situation like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1521.167s">In</a> theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1522.23s">very</a> possible to move kids around a building and either renovate or tear it down and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1529.492s">That's</a> all going to be something that we discuss during the logistics and phasing discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1535.194s">Definitely</a> later in the project, but we'll have a better idea of what's going on about what your space looks like versus what you should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1545.058s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1546.878s">One</a> last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1549.639s">I</a> promised we would take till 830.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1589.649s">So</a> I think I'm hearing that we might want to make a motion to request that OPM do a simple analysis of available properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1599.331s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1600.252s">Is</a> there somebody who wants to make that motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1608.333s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1608.633s">And</a> is there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1609.574s">Seconded</a> by Libby. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1612.454s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1613.775s">Well,</a> I'll call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1614.675s">Jenny</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1615.275s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1615.736s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1625.2s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1626.66s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1627.821s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1630.322s">Brian</a> Dorsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1631.222s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1632.163s">Brian</a> Hilliard. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1633.203s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1633.944s">Tracy</a> King. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1635.364s">Emily</a> Lazzaro said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1638.686s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1640.142s">No,</a> this is about to continue looking at other spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1643.623s">To</a> have left field do a cursory look at the other spaces available and create a chart for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1690.813s">and</a> the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1692.114s">So</a> yes to both. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1694.036s">Nicole</a> Morell.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1696.519s">15</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1717.332s">It</a> was a motion to do a peer review of available spaces at that part.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1747.431s">Okay,</a> moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1748.532s">So</a> the left field team has an update for us about the designer selection panel and the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1755.498s">So</a> we did officially get the green light to bring left field on board, we've signed the contract, all that was done in record time, thanks to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1769.089s">And</a> we're like, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1772.307s">eager</a> and ready to go, and we have some updates about what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1775.529s">So</a> I'm going to turn it over into the left field.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1858.248s">So</a> their designer selection panels until the end of September were completely full. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1864.891s">We</a> didn't tell them that if anything changes to let us know, we'll be ready to move at a moment's notice, but they do not foresee that happening.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1989.386s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1990.727s">So</a> as Matt summarized, we are <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1995.894s">looking</a> to move full speed ahead with that educational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=1999.336s">So</a> that, to bring everybody up to speed, what that is, the educational program is really, it's what the design of your building is based on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2008.46s">So</a> it is a layout of what programs you have now, or once the schools are officially combined their schedules next year, it'll lay out that program, and then also the future hopes and goals for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2026.283s">And</a> that is what the designer will take and they'll tell you how many spaces you need to achieve those goals and keep those programs or expand programs, add programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2036.89s">So</a> we're going to start working with Dr. Glucy and your team and try to get a good draft of that going by the time we have the designer on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2047.257s">I</a> would say 95% of it should be complete by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2051.32s">We've</a> sent over some today, I've sent over some <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2055.135s">Yes,</a> it's very long email. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2058.079s">So</a> yeah, wait, Jen. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2062.446s">Some</a> examples from other schools, from similar schools, from other MSBA projects of ours that have <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2070.738s">Received</a> praise, so things to look out for things to consider when we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2076.502s">Putting</a> together and the district's putting together the plan for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2081.105s">The</a> 1st draft of that is due with that 1st, January submission, the PDP, the preliminary design program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2088.87s">That</a> that point, the school committee will have signed off and then this group will sign off as it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2094.954s">Is</a> part of the package that goes to the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2099.648s">And</a> then that's, again, just a draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2102.709s">So</a> at that point, you'll still have the whole next phase, the preferred schematic report phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2109.192s">As</a> you're narrowing down to a single preferred solution for the building, you'll have time to edit that plan based on feedback we've heard from the NSBA at that point, based on things that the OPM, the design team, everybody is taking a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2126.319s">So</a> there will be time to edit it, <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2128.237s">until</a> next June, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2130.998s">But</a> we're starting the process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2132.199s">I</a> think we can make some really good headway on it between now and bringing the design team on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2136.46s">Handing</a> that to them will save a ton of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2138.721s">And</a> I think that we're going to hit the ground running. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2144.284s">Yeah,</a> we want to keep things moving.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2187.812s">And</a> just for all of you to know that has proposed meeting scheduled for us for the next year so that we can have a standing schedule and. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2199.881s">I</a> will pass this off to to Lisa to ask her to schedule calendar holds for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2207.337s">In</a> general, we try to stick to Monday night, but like, every holiday is on Monday and we have school committee to 2 meetings a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2216.72s">So</a> on the on those weeks where we had to have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2220.722s">Um,</a> or those months where we had to have a meeting and there wasn't a Monday, it's generally like a Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2225.984s">So</a> that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2227.104s">Roughly</a> what we're going to try to hold to, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2230.565s">I</a> will ask Lisa to send this full list out to you all as well as a list of. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2237.095s">a</a> calendar, a list of calendars.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2451.779s">I</a> could just add to that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2453.199s">We'll</a> talk about the makeup of the designer selection panel, because the group that has the ultimate say is unfortunately not this group here at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2464.081s">There</a> is a designer selection panel that is mostly made up of MSBA and state designated committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2472.255s">We</a> will have 3 people at that scene and then the ranking happens with all that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2478.941s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2479.801s">I've</a> seen things where there is the 1st, 3 ranked. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2484.245s">Highest</a> usually the last to do the 2nd, 2nd meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2490.03s">And</a> then the 4th is like a far drop off based on where the conversation is headed with the DSP and all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2499.078s">It</a> really does vary, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2501.3s">But</a> it won't just be this group, unfortunately.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2529.819s">We</a> will have lots of meetings with everyone to make sure that we're reviewing and what's important and things that this group finds important that should be brought forth to the larger DSP committees so that they hear some of the local thoughts and concerns from the review. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2557.098s">Will</a> you be part of that DSP process like in the room?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2565.664s">It's</a> being recorded, I can't see.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2642.629s">So</a> they choose 10 people, but they're not from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2646.233s">They're</a> just from wherever they are, so there are a standing committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2654.56s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2654.78s">So</a> it's they do they have the 10 people and they have 13 and we get. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2661.826s">Oh,</a> yeah, that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2663.147s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2663.847s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2664.668s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2666.209s">There's</a> just so many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2668.271s">But</a> they have 13 that are appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2670.112s">There</a> are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2671.494s">Architects,</a> engineers, people in the building industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2676.13s">MSBA</a> folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2677.371s">What</a> makes them not choose people that they're friends with? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2679.812s">This</a> is so frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2681.152s">What</a> makes them not choose people?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2684.094s">I</a> can't fight this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2687.535s">This</a> is the way the game is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2690.376s">But</a> I think the point, their goal from an MSBA perspective is that there are people in industry weighing in on, practically speaking, what needs to happen in these design studies because <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2704.168s">they</a> have a really prescriptive way that they want case design studies completed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2709.072s">So,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2843.958s">And</a> I will say, uh, the reason they have the FAIR, the superintendent school committee member on <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2850.203s">as</a> the three members, they really do listen, they do listen to the community and the concerns of those three members. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2858.928s">And</a> I think that making sure that the concerns, the thoughts are really prepared in advance and unified, and make sure that they really hear what the desires of your community are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2930.407s">We</a> can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2931.548s">We</a> can attend somebody else's DSV. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2933.368s">Oh,</a> we should do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2934.769s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=2987.214s">Any</a> questions about the DSD?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3162.725s">Oh,</a> in the RFS, if that's what you mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3165.946s">We</a> haven't recast that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3167.887s">It's</a> like on the to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3169.087s">We</a> can send it to you as soon as we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3172.109s">And</a> you're welcome to join us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3174.369s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3187.371s">Other</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3201.175s">Yes,</a> we can flag those. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3204.996s">So</a> far, we haven't had a war problem, but this is a marathon, not a sprint.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3209.617s">Without</a> any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3216.143s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3218.145s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3274.33s">That's</a> a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3275.451s">I</a> think one thought that I have is that that's like a September thing, because I think we will lack engagement in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3285.035s">But</a> I would be curious what you all think about that time, whether you think there would be significant engagement in summer for community meetings.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3658.985s">So</a> Linda, maybe you and Will can connect because Will has been maintaining our site so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3666.667s">And</a> then perhaps can work with Will for like another iteration of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3672.628s">Maybe</a> we can look at that at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3676.369s">And</a> then we can sort of tell you what we think and what we think will resonate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3681.445s">have</a> to do it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3682.166s">Can</a> I? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3682.546s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3683.347s">Does</a> that work well?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3731.089s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3732.53s">We</a> can look at the district calendar and figure out like, where is there some space?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3787.92s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3788.1s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3793.164s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3796.723s">by</a> Emily, seconded by Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3802.548s">I</a> will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3804.049s">Jenny</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3804.649s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eVGy96zbLTU&t=3805.03s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4486.595s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4488.075s">I</a> think this creates a lot of options which as you know like that's part of what we've been trying to do with this all of this schedule change is to is to open up the kind of options that students really have time to explore and <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4503.38s">get</a> the academic support that they need along the way and the prior schedule just didn't allow for that across many different kinds of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4512.785s">I</a> am really happy that we are sort of holding to our commitment to health education. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4518.767s">I</a> certainly think we have room to do the same in middle school and sort of look at the rigor around our middle school curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4528.592s">in</a> many regards, but I think providing this kind of flexibility at the high school level is really important because that's really where there is so much opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4537.638s">And</a> I think providing programming like athletic statistics and athletic training, like there's plenty of students who would really embrace that and it would back up the math teaching that is going on in the building as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4550.267s">So</a> I think opening up the electives in general, <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4555.878s">is</a> just it's new and it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4557.8s">But</a> I think there's so many possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4560.023s">And</a> I think especially when you can capture the attention of students in a thing that they're already passionate about, like you have so much more opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4569.713s">So</a> I'm really glad to hear about all of the elective offerings that this is allowing us to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4576.46s">because</a> there is there are only so many hours in the day and they're really there are only so many teachers in the building and so creating some ways for us to be a little bit more creative is super important and exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4587.743s">So</a> thank you for doing all this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4589.884s">I</a> know it's like at the very last minute, but I think students starting next year will be really appreciative of the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4598.547s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5041.805s">Member</a> Ruseau, I think, was first.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5119.829s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5124.142s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5125.923s">Thank</a> you for this reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5128.045s">I</a> think I just want to highlight some of the top line of this, which one is that the city increased its allocation to Medford Public Schools to 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5139.213s">So</a> thank you to the mayor for the hard work that I and the sweat that I think it took to get there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5149.04s">You</a> are very pushy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5155.548s">Yeah,</a> thank you very much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5157.849s">I</a> think it's super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5159.13s">But</a> you know, one of the things that if you look in the in the weeds of this, one of the things I'm most excited about is Miss Cabral from the high school has been talking about the need to create an alternative program at Medford High for two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5174.038s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5174.907s">Among</a> all of the things that have happened since we approved the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5179.893s">We</a> also collectively found funding for her to get that started and that will be really really critical particularly for some of our freshmen is is my understanding as they come up to the high school from the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5193.268s">to</a> have increased academic support so that they can graduate on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5198.57s">And</a> I think that's a huge, it's a huge deal to be able to have this space to create this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5204.512s">And</a> I know that that wasn't, you know, that wasn't in the budget when we started so adding that sort of made things slightly worse in terms of reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5214.535s">but</a> we were able to to get there through any number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5218.217s">We'll</a> talk in just a few minutes about the MEEP line items as well because that came up and well that's I think next on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5228.323s">But</a> I'm just really happy that we were able to have a budget year without fanfare and I <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5235.087s">do</a> want to thank everybody who supported questions seven and eight because that is why we were able to have a budget without fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5242.989s">For</a> those people who may be listening at home, I think the other important thing about the stabilization funds that we're talking about is those stabilization funds are being put into place because there are things that we will pay for in FY26 that <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5257.893s">got</a> going in some way, shape or form in FY 25, which is the reason we have to hold the money over. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5263.279s">We</a> also are continuing to negotiate with our bargaining partners, including the nurses and the paras and our maintenance team and our cafeteria staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5276.054s">And</a> who am I missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5280.234s">next</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5281.755s">So</a> there's still like four or five, four unions or so that we are working diligently with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5286.936s">We</a> had meetings earlier today with one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5289.997s">And</a> so all of that unknown means in all likelihood, those funds are going to need to be expended in FY26 instead of FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5297.92s">So</a> the stabilization fund that will <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5300.341s">go</a> before the council to be created will just allow us the flexibility to do that without creating another crisis next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5308.887s">So</a> I think all of this is sort of thank you to the sound fiscal management that's happening at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5316.371s">I</a> know it's a constant <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5319.373s">constantly</a> moving pile of quicksand when you look at the budget and the number of people and who, who is where and who's retiring and who's needs to come in and who you know how all of this fits together so I just think like you both have done a really really nice job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5337.203s">And</a> when we can boil down a meeting in June to one page, that's clear as day what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5343.205s">Like</a> we have made so many considerable strides in our finance office. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5347.586s">Like</a> I'm really, really impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5349.407s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5351.788s">And</a> I would make a motion to approve the budget as amended.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5491.698s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5492.798s">We</a> did have a subcommittee meeting a few light years ago now, but actually on May 20th, <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5503.386s">And</a> during that meeting, Dr. Pelosi shared a presentation with us that provided all of this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5509.331s">It</a> was linked in your packets for anybody who wants to take a deeper dive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5515.095s">And</a> we talked a little bit about the data and what the data was telling us across all of our elementary schools in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5522.601s">And</a> we talked to, had a really interesting conversation about potential solutions, all of which, <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5531.309s">are</a> longer term than the immediate need that we have to make sure that we have space to welcome students in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5540.064s">Dr.</a> Galusi also let us know that <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5544.805s">there</a> will be a detailed space study happening in the district this summer to really sort of map out and lay out like our plan as we go forward when we look at our enrollment trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5557.034s">So</a> now that we are looking at our enrollment trends in a formal way every year, it makes sense to say what, you know, how far into the future does this <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5566.882s">particular</a> plan hold and what are the possible solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5571.003s">So</a> that will be happening this year, this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5575.504s">But</a> we did make a couple of motions in subcommittee that I think that we should read out here and vote on as a larger committee because the Roberts right now is full and the question becomes like what do we do in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5596.61s">alleviate</a> that issue for August because the space study is not going to have those kinds of magical answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5604.935s">So,</a> we had some public participation from members of the Roberts community as well as some of our other elementary communities and there were a couple of motions that came out of the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5616.262s">So,</a> one was a motion to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5624.987s">and</a> that was unanimously agreed to be voted out to this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5631.448s">Creating</a> that space, so the Missittuck has space for those two classrooms, but creating two classrooms worth of space at the Roberts is pretty pivotal to what comes next, which was to request two additional FTEs at the Roberts to account for some of the bigger bubble classrooms that we have and there's <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5651.872s">like</a> more bubbles there on a continuous basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5655.334s">So</a> they're probably not bubbles anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5657.396s">They</a> probably just started like sort of the way things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5660.758s">But</a> those FTE counts were also in the budget that we just approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5666.621s">So</a> that these have been accounted for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5670.406s">That</a> also passed unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5672.506s">And</a> then there was a third motion as amended to create a strategic space planning task force of staff and caregivers once the space utilization study is completed by the HMFH architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5686.929s">And</a> that also passed unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5688.79s">So</a> I think the space study is going to be really important so that we know what options we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5695.832s">but</a> then the real work will begin in terms of what does that mean in terms of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5700.955s">So</a> having a task force of sorts of staff and caregivers to be part of that process as it unfolds in the late summer and early fall was another recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5713.483s">So</a> I think we should take a vote on those three and we can do it all together or we can do them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5721.328s">We</a> should do them separate, okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5755.527s">So</a> do you want me to read the motions? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5758.149s">That</a> would be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5759.55s">Okay,</a> sure.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8gpW9hN9Tuo&t=226.871s">Dr.</a> Cushing, I was asked for my Google credentials when I signed in, and I'm wondering if there's a problem with the link that we need to fix before we get started.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8gpW9hN9Tuo&t=259.26s">So</a> if somebody wants to join the meeting and they don't have a Google account, can they not join?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=544.665s">Dr.</a> Blue Sea, can I just clarify real quick before you move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=547.427s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=548.068s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=548.228s">Do</a> you want me to go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=549.569s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=550.229s">No,</a> I don't think that matters tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=552.871s">But</a> the difference between what Salem Street and some of the other developments is that Salem Street is not actually a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=564.16s">Salem</a> Street is a zoning effort to allow projects in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=569.804s">So</a> there is no project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=573.043s">That</a> I'm aware of that is, like, in the same kind of development phase that, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=580.47s">Projects</a> in Medford square are with the new announcement of the project there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=586.797s">That's</a> a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=587.918s">It</a> has a number of units. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=591.181s">Salem</a> street is not that Salem street is zoning that allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=597.782s">Owners</a> of property to do things to their property that that is the only thing that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=603.844s">That</a> zoning effort is happening across the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=607.445s">Actually,</a> it is not just Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=610.206s">Um,</a> there is, there are rezoning efforts happening city wide, and they are being looked at neighborhood to neighborhood, but none of those efforts equals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=620.369s">A</a> project in the same way that, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=623.05s">The</a> project on the Fellsway is a project with a number of units, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=626.673s">So</a> not to say that that can't come, but that is one of the key differences in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=633.357s">And</a> I think that can get sort of muddled in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=637.9s">So</a> I just wanted to clarify that before we moved on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=652.144s">Yeah,</a> and I think the other thing that we may want to share eventually is some of the rationale around the enrollment study that we just finished for Medford high. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=663.995s">And</a> there was a lot of discussion there about. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=668.017s">what</a> housing development really does to student enrollment and the data does not show that it changes student enrollment in any drastic way with a few exceptions in terms of the types of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=681.385s">Um,</a> and so we can make that available, um, as well in a little bit more of a connected way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=689.431s">Um,</a> because that, that enrollment study I thought was like enlightening and interesting in terms of like what we were, <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=697.038s">How</a> they looked at our enrollment and how we had to do some digging in a couple of places where we felt like specific plans developments were going to do something different to our enrollment than we were, than the sort of normal numbers would bare metal.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=1661.55s">So,</a> did you have a question I see your hand up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2324.88s">Your</a> keyboard arrow do it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2942.85s">I</a> think, you know, as I've been looking at this list as well, like, the other thing that sort of strikes me that is a conundrum is when you look at the placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2952.594s">Of</a> relative to the placement of all the other schools geographically. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2959.345s">It</a> does create a challenge because it's in the corner of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2964.648s">So</a> there's, there's not a 360 degree realm around the talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2971.111s">There's</a> just like, you know, sort of half of that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2973.812s">There's</a> 180 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2976.31s">Of</a> houses available, and I'm not a space planning expert, nor am I a redistricting expert, but I've looked at the maps several times and just sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2988.364s">Gotten</a> to the conclusion that, like, we would have to pick kids up next to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=2994.21s">and</a> send them to the Missituk or we'd have to pick them up next door to the Brooks and send them to the Missituk because there's no other way you could like scoop up another 150 kids because of the placement of that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3008.764s">And</a> it does make me wonder whether the placement of that school does mean it shouldn't <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3017.959s">Be</a> used quite the same way as the other schools that have, like, an actual radius around them in terms of, like, pulling students into a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3027.028s">That's</a> not too too far away so that we can have more walkers to school and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3033.235s">Which</a> I think is valuable for all kinds of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3036.538s">So</a> I've often thought about, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3039.661s">What</a> could be actually, like, the early didn't sort of come to my mind, but I was really thinking, like, we've invested all this money in the McGlynn playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3051.047s">Could</a> the McGlynn become a much bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3054.009s">Elementary</a> school and the take on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3058.022s">something</a> else like a 5-6 or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3061.904s">So</a> I do think this like study would be a really important place to sort of get some additional data about where we go from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3074.049s">The</a> other concern that I have though is like what do we need to do for August to alleviate what's happening at the Roberts? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3085.013s">Like</a> do we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3088.488s">Ask</a> incoming kindergarten parents if there are volunteers to be redistricted over to miss a tuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3095.513s">Like,</a> how do we, it just seems like there is 610 students is too many students for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3101.317s">So</a> what. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3103.638s">What</a> do we need to do in the short term? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3107.501s">I</a> think is my question that could alleviate the right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3223.426s">And</a> do you have a sense for like, and maybe this is a next step, like if we relocated the MEEP, <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3230.59s">Programs.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3232.492s">How</a> big could the kindergarten class get before like, we have to ring the bell again at like, could could you take if you relocated those 2 classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3242.241s">Could</a> you take a 5th class at the next year?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3262.353s">No,</a> I think that's what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3263.674s">If</a> you don't have those two MEEP classes, could you add a section knowing how the rest of your sections in the other grades are going to fall out? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3278.014s">We</a> needed 6 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3281.677s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3355.542s">So,</a> if we move those to meet classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3359.245s">You</a> can have the right number of classrooms 1 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3366.369s">And</a> you could again support 5 kindergartens if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3371.372s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3372.653s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3373.294s">That</a> I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3375.783s">With</a> additional with the additional right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3379.905s">So,</a> my next question is whether the additional staff that the Roberts needs are in the budget yet, or if we need to, you know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3388.85s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3389.53s">Okay,</a> so we have to find a way to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3395.033s">2</a> additional 2.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3417.884s">And</a> does the budget include five kindergarten or four? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3423.068s">Five.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3424.029s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3424.769s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3425.87s">So</a> it's net two extra that we need to find a home for in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3431.215s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3432.316s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3434.014s">Um,</a> the, so the space study, my other question, um, is whether the space, the space that he only basically is going to give us the data of like, here's what you could consider doing with this space. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3446.4s">Like,</a> they're not going to engage in like the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3452.763s">Conversation</a> that's for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3455.925s">It</a> is a member.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3558.57s">If</a> not, I can give a brief update. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3561.592s">I</a> mean, what. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3563.155s">Because</a> we currently have some early childhood programming in the high school and because previously it was all there, there is a willingness on the part of the MSBA to allow that to be in scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3577.058s">So</a> it is in scope to explore a universal-ish pre-K model. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3588.96s">That</a> could be housed in the new building, whatever that new building looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3594.765s">The,</a> the reimbursement structures a little bit different on the Pre K side than it is on the typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3602.692s">Uh,</a> like, 9 to 12 side, but there is reimbursement there particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3606.975s">I</a> think and it will change, of course, as the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3610.247s">Assuming</a> the state continues to push on the idea of universal pre-K and prioritize and spend accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3617.831s">So</a> I think of this effort as something that we have to do to create some slack in the system to get us to that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3631.498s">And</a> then potentially be able to extract from this <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3637.373s">bigger</a> picture, the pre-K and put it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3641.595s">So</a> we should sort of be thinking about that when we're thinking about solutions so that we're not like yo-yoing, so to speak, back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3652.861s">But</a> I think until we have the data about what's possible, you know, that will be tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3658.384s">Like,</a> again, in my mind, like, I sort of feel like put 5-6 at the Missittuck and <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3667.513s">Let</a> the fact that it is that it doesn't have a radius around it and it's in the corner of the city not matter because everyone's going to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3677.193s">versus</a> trying to maintain it as the same as the other elementary schools, who knows if that's actually possible or feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3686.02s">So</a> I look forward to the study results so that we then can say, OK, with all of this, what really do we have to do and when? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3697.71s">And</a> frankly, how does it line up with what will happen at the high school and particularly as the feasibility study there advances? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3707.424s">the</a> pre-K piece comes into focus.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3942.37s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3943.03s">Remember,</a> I felt I have some thoughts about next steps, but before we do that, I did want to find out if there was anybody who has joined us who had a question or a comment for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3957.878s">And</a> you can just use the raise hand feature and we will be able to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3980.965s">Just</a> wanted to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3982.526s">Kroll</a> and Mr. DiClemente for being here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3988.75s">I</a> know it's a full day and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=3992.233s">So</a> thank you for being here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4012.221s">I</a> do see a lot of parents who I know have lots of things to say, generally speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4019.845s">So</a> are you sure there's nothing you want to add to the conversation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4034.951s">We</a> have a hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4037.012s">Christina</a> McGordy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4038.973s">I</a> am going to <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4041.542s">Mute</a> you, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4047.165s">Hi,</a> I think that worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4049.066s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4049.546s">And</a> can you give me your name and address for the record?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4188.255s">And</a> thank you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4190.137s">I</a> think what I heard, and maybe Dr can confirm is that to meet classes, then we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4198.783s">We</a> would not have a need to also relocate kind of partners this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4203.226s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4204.347s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4291.537s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4292.858s">I</a> see Rebecca Gutland with a hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4296.8s">Rebecca,</a> can you unmute or do you need me to do it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4318.071s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4501.681s">Thank</a> you, Rebecca. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4504.563s">Anybody</a> else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4736.821s">Else</a> other questions comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4749.229s">Christina.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4839.744s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4840.465s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4844.12s">And</a> obviously, Mr. Sherman Hudson will be involved in all of those conversations in terms of what happens in her building. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4851.228s">So,</a> but I think, you know, I do think it's very interesting, like, to just point out that what people think of as, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4859.877s">A</a> thing that happens in their school and how it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4865.224s">Would</a> be different or change, like, chances are that change is happening, like, every single day somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4871.248s">Like,</a> you know, Rebecca said, oh, I go to 2 stem nights and I was like, we didn't have stem night. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4876.892s">So</a> there's just all kinds of differences across the schools that get operationalized and really, really different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4883.096s">So</a> the good news is we're not creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4887.271s">New</a> things that we haven't done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4889.213s">It's</a> just that we have to look in buildings different than perhaps we're used to, like, solving like, building based problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4896.298s">And</a> so I think that's good because we have done this in kindergarten in many places for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4903.584s">Years</a> now, and I will say, I get a lot of emails about a lot of things and the lack of a bathroom in a kindergarten is 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4910.469s">I</a> have not received so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4912.996s">Um,</a> I'll take that as a win, but I think it's good that we have a lot of options across, um, you know, across the. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4922.945s">The</a> district to learn from, um, so that's great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4958.761s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4960.922s">All</a> of these things are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4963.042s">It's</a> all change and you have to work your way through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4968.725s">You</a> know, in whatever way it is needed, so it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4973.05s">I</a> just, I'm, I'm glad that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4975.452s">The</a> principles are not, like, also having to be space planners in their spare time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4979.817s">Like,</a> they can talk to each other and hear about how they, how these things have been operationalized real time, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=4988.158s">I</a> have a few thoughts in terms of next steps around what we might report out to the school committee and just so that they have a sense of what we talked about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5001.57s">So</a> there may need to be a brief presentation at our next school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5009.798s">And</a> I was thinking that we might want to report out this committee recommending that those need classes move recommending that the budget addition of 2 occur and then potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5026.012s">The</a> formation of some sort of caregiver team that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5033.521s">will</a> work with us on the space, I don't know what to call it, the strategic space planning team or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5042.608s">Namely,</a> maybe a small group of people who can help support community engagement, which will have to start to happen in the fall once that initial study is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5056.478s">Those</a> were the three things I was thinking about in terms of what comes next. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5063.047s">And</a> I don't know if my colleagues agree with that and want to make motion so that we can vote those out or have other thoughts.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5084.616s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5088.757s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5090.722s">The</a> first motion is to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the miss a tuck starting in August of 2025 by members.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5283.662s">Okay,</a> so we have a motion to recommend that these two MEEP classrooms move from the Roberts to the Misituc starting in August 2025 by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5301.19s">So</a> I'll call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5302.17s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5304.851s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5305.852s">Yes,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5307.41s">Yes,</a> yes, 3, 0, motion passes the 2nd motion by members. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5314.791s">So,</a> was to request the addition of 2 to the Robert school budget beginning in August of 2025 is there a 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5327.133s">2nd,</a> so the motion is by members. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5331.634s">So,</a> seconded by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/9fui-IqEKvo&t=5334.515s">So,</a> I'll call the role members.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=661.34s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=662.6s">I</a> just also wanted to say that we were introduced to Andrew and basic through some of the folks who I hope will join us on the after school task force at some point in the near future, because they did a whole bunch of data collection and identified basic as an organization who's been able to do some things that we have long struggled to do here in Medford, including like essentially eliminating their waitlist but also <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=690.055s">radically</a> changing the the type of programming that has happened, or that is available to students in his in those districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=699.787s">So,</a> the Dr. Galusi and I had a preliminary conversation with him just to understand, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=708.75s">the</a> sort of what really was happening in those other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=712.592s">And</a> that's sort of where this consultancy unfolded from because I think, you know, he would have been very happy to come here and do the same thing that he has done successfully in other districts, which is to take this off our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=725.42s">But</a> that has some downsides here that, you know, in our conversations we identified as like maybe not in Medford's collective best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=732.865s">But</a> one of the things that I appreciated about the conversation was not just, and he didn't just have ideas of like what, of how we could do things differently and make a different impact, but instead he could cite specifically how he did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=749.176s">And</a> he seemed to have, and does have a really <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=752.639s">keen</a> eye towards implementation, which I think is something district wide that we have always struggled with, not just an after school but across the board so you know in in the conversation with him we sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=765.136s">try,</a> you know, try to just understand what that program was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=769.458s">And</a> then had some conversation about like, how do we basically have the best of both worlds, which is this program still belongs to us, but also like, it's expanded in the way that Andrew has been successful in doing in both Belmont and Maynard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=784.263s">And</a> so this consultancy conversation came up in that context. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=790.586s">I</a> just wanted to thank the folks in the room who are maybe on zoom or maybe here with us tonight that have that so graciously introduced us to Andrew and this model, because it really sort of changed, in my opinion, changed the conversation that we're having about after school and finally has like provided some ability for us to break through what has been like just a complete log jam for a really long time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2040.053s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2041.574s">I</a> just wanted to also add, as I was listening to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2045.578s">I</a> think one of the things that Andrew described like I think really actually when I spoke to him for the first time is there's just a huge spectrum of what after school means based on the particular program that you're talking about, and he, you know, he sort of said it goes from like <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2063.615s">warehouse</a> to like highly curated, focused curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2068.576s">And</a> I think we're somewhere in the middle of all of that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2072.878s">But</a> I think part of what intrigued me about this full time staff is, he's not just he's not simply saying, I'm just going to pay you like you work full time, even though you work part time, like that is not his model. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2084.041s">But</a> instead, his model is, I have people who are creating curriculum, and who are <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2089.422s">curating</a> the experience that improves the, like the quality of the program for part of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2096.348s">And</a> then the other part of the day, their feet on the ground and with kids doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2101.633s">So</a> it's a, there's like sort of a two hat role in there that we don't have today in that same way that I'm excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2109.62s">The</a> thing that excites me is like, once we can get past this hump of, you know, our intractable wait list, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2116.586s">We</a> actually have an opportunity to start to say, how do we plug the needs of our students into this model in some meaningful way so if we have kids who need specific help with homework, how can we create that we have kids who need executive function support, how can we create. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2135.135s">structures</a> within this program to deal with that, not just for the kids who are like, quote, lucky enough to get a spot, but that there's enough spots that if you need that kind of support, you can have it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2147.921s">And</a> so I think it sort of, to me, it opens the door possibility beyond just like, do we have enough spaces for kids who need it to how do we extend the day in a different way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2160.827s">In</a> those particular ways that are meaningful based on what specific kids need, which we don't do right now we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2169.673s">And</a> thinking about that as a possibility in the next like handful of years is like a really like to me a really big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2179.723s">also</a> really appreciated Andrew's willingness to talk about this like consultancy model because that is financially not as advantageous for him and his organization as just taking our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2194.57s">But</a> losing $2 million a year in revenue was just not something that any of us felt like was in the district's best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2200.993s">So</a> I do think there's a financial model where all of this levels out and <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2206.856s">we</a> can invest, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2208.297s">And</a> so I think creating this, this mechanism to be able to invest in increasing the quality of the programming is really exciting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2218.782s">And</a> I would love nothing more than to be able to tell parents who are emailing me about after school that we have solved it after all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2225.885s">So</a> I'm excited about that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2228.847s">But</a> mostly like just being able to really think beyond what we have done here, I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2235.03s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2236.424s">I'm</a> really grateful that we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2239.167s">pulling</a> the communication piece into this in a more formal way and saying to our communications director, like, we want you to be doing this communication piece because it's really high stakes for families and it's really an add on to what we do as a district or what our mission is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2258.264s">But</a> it's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2259.445s">So</a> I feel like it just has never gotten the attention it needs and deserves, the communication around this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2267.355s">and</a> we can fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2268.735s">So</a> I'm excited about that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2272.676s">And</a> I'm happy to make a motion to approve this recommendation so that the district can proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2278.058s">I</a> think time is wasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2279.498s">So</a> I will defer to my colleagues if they have other questions and certainly folks in the audience who I believe may have come to speak, but I would like to put a motion on the table to approve this plan to move forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2378.842s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2379.363s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2381.748s">I</a> did just have a question and it's gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2384.753s">I</a> will let you know when it comes back.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2432.939s">Sure,</a> remember Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2434.6s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2435.761s">My,</a> my question is whether before the end of this school year we will see staff rate staff increases for their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2449.527s">as</a> we normally do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2450.569s">I</a> know last year we just had like a weird snafu and I think that got left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2456.016s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're not leaving that behind again. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2458.76s">No,</a> we're not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2461.484s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3877.196s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3880.222s">So</a> I can maybe give you my take on some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3884.426s">So</a> I think just to clarify, students are in the CTE rotation for one period a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3890.211s">So</a> it takes two periods to get all of the students through, but they go once out of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3897.517s">So</a> what they do now is, so it's different because it's a six-day schedule instead of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3904.763s">So</a> they have two blocks, and they go <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3909.178s">four</a> blocks to a CTE rotation and then two to phys ed or health and they swap. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3915.002s">So,</a> when you look forward, they're only going to do that one so I do understand like the reduction of that causing some trouble with getting through the health curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3926.63s">So</a> when I, but when I was thinking about this, I was hoping we could find flexibility in a bunch of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3933.714s">So</a> one is in scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3936.576s">The</a> other is in some of these independent study options, which I think create options for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3941.498s">I</a> think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3943.059s">But</a> I was also, I also think we need to think about flexibility in our graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3948.682s">So</a> this doesn't fundamentally change that we are expecting four years of PE and four years of, or three years of health. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3957.393s">That's</a> great, but it is well in excess of what the state requires us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3962.575s">And</a> so I think one of the things that I would like to see us consider is to require perhaps something like three years of PE and two years of health and one additional year of PE or health, your choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3977.842s">So</a> if we're talking about electives, I think that's great because it can give students an opportunity to go deeper into something they're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3987.287s">If</a> you're taking an elective, you should get to take an elective of the thing that you want, not an elective within this particular bucket because it's a graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=3995.594s">So</a> as I was reading this and digesting this, there's some pieces of this I really like. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4001.239s">There</a> are some pieces of it that I think we could go further in terms of creating flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4008.125s">And</a> I think the other thing that we could consider is that the two years, the two periods of PE, which would be health one, let's just call health one for the sake of simplicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4020.497s">There's</a> no reason that could not happen freshman year we now have seven periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4025.342s">You</a> can take four core subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4026.842s">You</a> can take a language. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4027.823s">You</a> can take a rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4029.063s">And</a> all the eighth graders are like, what do I do with this seventh period? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4033.744s">And</a> they're just like sort of picking electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4035.744s">There's</a> no reason why that slot can't be used for health. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4040.005s">So</a> I don't think it has to necessarily delay health in order to move to some more flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4047.787s">But</a> I think it could be a choice, like if students <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4051.61s">No,</a> they have to take two years and there's something else pressing or urgent that they want to do that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4057.896s">But</a> I think part of creating flexibility should also be us revisiting what we are requiring for graduation if we want to create access and interest like <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4066.882s">Maybe</a> you want to be a nutritionist or a public health professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4071.826s">And</a> so you want to take five electives in health. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4074.889s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4076.43s">But</a> if you have no desire to do any of those things, maybe your elective time would be better spent doing something musical or doing something technology oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4085.217s">So</a> I think this continues to preserve this idea that we must have all of this stuff in health and PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4093.003s">And</a> I think the truth is we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4096.226s">I</a> would like to see us amend this further so that we are creating real flexibility in a bunch of different ways for students, because I think that's what's best for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4108.571s">And</a> I know that that's probably not what's best for the schedule right now, because I can appreciate the amount of work being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4116.054s">But</a> there is no reason why you couldn't use that seventh block, which, by the way, the eighth graders have no idea what to do with anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4125.085s">for</a> the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4126.417s">to</a> cover health elective if they want to do it on that seventh block. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4133.783s">You</a> know, everybody's got a different interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4135.524s">Some</a> kids are not interested in CTE, then they definitely could take health, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4139.727s">They're</a> not interested in that kind of a rotation, then they definitely could take health. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4143.831s">So</a> I think there are some other ways for us to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4147.814s">I</a> would be happy to amend this recommendation if that's what we wanna do tonight, or if we feel like we're not ready for that, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4154.986s">But</a> my amendment would be that we are amending the graduation requirements to require three years of PE, two years of health, and one additional year at your choice, PE or health, which could include all of these independent study options, which I think are wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4171.252s">So</a> I'm happy to make that amendment officially. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4173.453s">And</a> if we're not ready for that, I'm fine with that too.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4726.464s">No,</a> I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4727.004s">No,</a> go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4728.085s">So,</a> um. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4731.008s">Great</a> member. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4731.928s">So</a> it's going to read it for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4752.185s">And</a> Mayor member Graham, I think what I would ideally like to see is there's like maybe some tightening up of the language that could be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4764.636s">So</a> maybe we see what this would look like both in the graduation requirements policy, as well as like what <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4772.203s">what</a> this offering would be and look like for students um you know like at the next meeting or something so that there's because we just did a lot of changes and I want to make sure there's something cohesive that we all agree is the spirit of what we're saying um when we say we're going to amend this recommendation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4840.933s">I</a> think that would allow flexibility, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4844.475s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5331.336s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5331.716s">I</a> just had two suggestions on this job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5336.539s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5338.22s">One</a> is under instructional technology leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5343.624s">The</a> very last bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5345.625s">Instead</a> of saying directly supervise the network administrator, I would just recommend that we say the district's senior it leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5353.89s">Because</a> right now, that is a network administrator, but that is likely not to be the senior person in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5361.995s">So</a> I just wanted to be clear that it's all yours, whoever this person is, and that the senior leadership of IT, as that department evolves, will report into this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5376.444s">And</a> then my other suggestion is under operational infrastructure and cross functional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5383.208s">I</a> would like to see this person be responsible for full implementation and optimization of our operations hero platform, which has been rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5396.156s">and</a> needs attention to really start to produce the kinds of benefits that we want to see from a facilities, maintenance, security perspective across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5409.321s">And</a> moving from that, like trying to get out of the backlog of being reactionary and into a proactive maintenance space. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5418.804s">So</a> just to very specifically talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5423.024s">that</a> full implement implementation and optimization.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6555.022s">Yes,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6556.424s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6558.83s">Transfer</a> number two, the comment says this budget transfer will cover the taxes and the number of employees given unemployment, which was larger than the budgeted amount of FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6568.296s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6570.178s">Can</a> you clarify which part is larger, the taxes or the number of employees given unemployment or both?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6586.923s">I</a> guess I just wasn't thinking that there was a huge number of unemployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6593.015s">folks?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6594.075s">Is</a> it is it more that there's a bigger number of employees that are contributing to our taxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6600.338s">I</a> just want to make sure I'm clear about the narrative of like, higher than expected unemployed staff.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6676.165s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6676.545s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6677.526s">That</a> helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6677.986s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6678.767s">I'm</a> all set.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7490.273s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7490.653s">I</a> guess two comments or questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7495.557s">One</a> is, when we communicate about this, can we tighten up the communication that previously went out about this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7505.406s">Because</a> that communication generated more questions than <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7510.85s">answers.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7511.992s">And</a> I think this is like sort of late in the game so I think addressing questions like, what if I already registered for summer fun camp and I want to do this instead is that allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7520.463s">I</a> think we just need to like contextualize that this is, this is an academic offering that <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7527.733s">we</a> are providing sort of based on the availability of this grant and that is part of why this is happening at this point in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7537.14s">So</a> if we could just make sure that communication is really tight and clear so we don't create confusion or an idea that this is a better camp than summer fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7548.608s">I</a> think they are different and they're intended to be so but I think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7552.568s">articulate</a> that when we communicate about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7555.312s">So</a> that would be one request. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7557.535s">And</a> the other request I have is that as we start working on <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7562.41s">slushing</a> out the work that we're going to do with basic around after school is that we get a cohesive out of school time program put together, where we can think about things like could both of these things have happened in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7579.067s">I</a> know right this year that's not possible for all the reasons which is fine because of the HVAC project but are there, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7587.021s">What</a> should a portfolio of summer programs look like that would maybe support some of the costs around the academic enrichment or additional academic support? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7601.165s">Can</a> these programs start to fund that for us so we are less reliant on grants and more reliant on a self-funding program that can do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7609.827s">So</a> that's like a next year thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7611.328s">But</a> as we talk about after school and what's possible, I would also like some of these programs to be a little bit less like haphazard around the district and a little bit more cohesive.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7740.951s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7741.511s">I</a> was just curious, is this a replace? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7744.394s">I'm</a> not sure where this came from or who suggested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7748.177s">Is</a> it a replacement? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7749.157s">What's</a> changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7749.978s">If</a> that would be helpful.<h2><a href="../2025-05-12_Gg7MfqcnomU/2025-05-12_Gg7MfqcnomU.html">MHCSBC Full Meeting - May 12, 2025</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=298.983s">And</a> Lisa Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=301.286s">Okay,</a> so we have 12 present, three absent, so we have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=311.037s">I</a> wanted to start by welcoming Lisa Miller to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=314.942s">Lisa</a> is one of our vocational teachers here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=319.311s">As</a> you all may remember from the last time we met, Larry Brown resigned from the committee, had sort of done his year, which is what he committed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=330.559s">And</a> we asked, the school committee asked that Marta identify another teacher who could adequately represent the vocational side of the house, which is sort of the role that Larry was playing in that interim space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=344.828s">And</a> she identified Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=345.688s">So</a> Lisa, welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=346.789s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=347.449s">We're</a> excited to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=349.057s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=350.578s">OK,</a> the next item on the agenda is our consent agenda, which includes approval of meeting minutes from January 23, which was a communications and community engagement subcommittee, and February 24, which was a full committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=367.147s">Is</a> there a motion to approve the minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=369.648s">Sorry,</a> a motion to approve the consent agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=372.17s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=373.23s">By</a> Tracy Keene, seconded by Lindy Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=376.468s">Okay,</a> I'll call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=377.629s">Jenny</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=378.77s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=381.172s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=382.773s">Dr.</a> Palusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=383.734s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=384.475s">Dr.</a> Cushing.

<a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=509.341s">So</a> they graciously agreed to be here on their own dime at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=513.803s">So</a> thank you left field team for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=516.544s">And</a> then once the MSBA approves, the city can execute the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=523.527s">So</a> what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=525.727s">It</a> means that between now and then, we have already gotten record requests from bidders who wanna know how could I improve <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=535.68s">You</a> know, how could I improve the competitiveness of my proposal and all those things? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=539.642s">All</a> of that has to wait until the contract is signed, which will happen in mid-June. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=545.906s">I've</a> had a couple of UL requests, some of those documents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=549.929s">And</a> we have to sort of apply the same logic in terms of responding to those requests, is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=557.594s">But</a> the elected team does have a presentation to share with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=563.44s">that</a> you'll get a copy of that to take home with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=566.901s">Hello,</a> hello, hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=572.342s">So</a> I just want to stop right there before I introduce the left field team. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=576.763s">Are</a> there any questions about where we are in the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=580.864s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=582.865s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=585.025s">I</a> still feel like we're in the paperwork phase of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=603.931s">Yeah,</a> no, that's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=605.592s">So</a> we had to, by last week, submit a full package of information to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=612.557s">And</a> then from there, the MSBA reviews the package. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=616.079s">They'll</a> respond to us with questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=617.9s">I</a> actually got a document, and there was a sentence that was like two choppy half sentences, and they asked me to consolidate them, so I did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=626.326s">So</a> there's some back and forth that we'll do as they're vetting the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=630.561s">And</a> then once they- It's at the Museum of Science. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=637.142s">Once</a> everything is in order, it goes to the OPM selection panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=642.484s">That</a> panel reviews the submission and takes a vote to either agree with our recommendation or to, I guess they could send us back to the drawing board if for some reason they felt like something was out of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=669.98s">It's</a> not a board meeting, but it is a scheduled, I believe, public meeting that happens once a month, if I remember correctly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=682.685s">June</a> 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=684.426s">Yeah,</a> June 2nd, we are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=688.008s">They</a> take a limited number of communities each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=693.09s">This</a> is where their process is easy to understand, but kind of rigid at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=699.972s">But</a> we got into the queue because what we did in February was approve the RFS even ahead of the invitation to the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=709.675s">That</a> meant we were right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=711.895s">I</a> submitted all of the paperwork the next day, and we were able to get into the queue for June. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=717.43s">So</a> that sort of speed and turnaround talk, we'll come back to that when we get to the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=724.896s">But</a> until we can get our team on board, it's just all of us in a room with some paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=731.401s">And</a> the real exciting stuff happens when you can get the actual experts in the room to start thinking about what does this look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=738.986s">So</a> I'm going to stop talking and invite the left field team to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=743.13s">So</a> Jim Rogers is the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=746.66s">of</a> left field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=748.221s">And</a> then Matt and Linda will be our day to day people on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=753.242s">They</a> come with a much bigger team. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=755.843s">Some</a> folks had vacations and different things to to deal with, but I'm going to turn it over to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=761.465s">I</a> just want you all to know it was absolutely unanimous that left field was the right partner for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=816.11s">So</a> that was Dr. Cushing, Dr. Gluzman, Dr. Brown, myself, Paul, Fiona, and John. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=827.656s">So</a> we spent a lot of time together in the last class. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=837.313s">And</a> if you want to come stand roughly in this space, Peter can point the camera at you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=1413.915s">And</a> then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=1415.297s">Do</a> you want to move it over that way so that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2146.236s">Yeah,</a> and I will say just by way of some color commentary, that was true of every player that made it to the finalist list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2158.941s">The</a> folks that didn't make it to the finalist list often were much smaller or didn't have as much high school experience, which was what weighted them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2168.964s">But</a> everyone who came and presented had a pretty comparable story in terms of staffing approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2175.868s">timing</a> and all of that good stuff.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2438.168s">Can</a> you just hold your question till we get to the RFS review? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2442.79s">It</a> is like, there's not a lot of like wiggle room in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2446.892s">Like</a> it's a template. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2448.012s">You</a> cannot change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2449.333s">If</a> you change it, they will ask you to change it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2453.054s">So</a> it's not as complex as it sounds to get it out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2457.616s">It's</a> really about like, can we get <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2460.115s">in</a> the queue with MSBA for the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2463.378s">But</a> we can talk about that as soon as left field is done with this part of the presentation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3397.635s">selection</a> committee had to sit through but.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3441.449s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3444.127s">If</a> there are no more questions, the other thing that we did want to talk a little bit about tonight was the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3450.949s">So</a> assuming all goes well on June 2nd and we execute the contract, the next step is to bring the architects into the mix, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3461.952s">So</a> that we can really begin the study work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3465.233s">And</a> if you recall, what we did with the RFS for the OPM back in February is we looked at the redlined copy <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3474.522s">There</a> were some suggestions made by this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3477.384s">There</a> was a vote to approve as amended, and then that went over to the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3485.668s">They</a> weighed in, we finalized it, and it went out the door, and here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3490.31s">So</a> the idea that the selection team was pushing as we were having conversations with potential partners, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3502.14s">was</a> how can we accelerate to the point where we actually get to do the work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3507.965s">How</a> do we get to the point where we get to do the feasibility study? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3511.508s">And</a> so I joked with actually all of the finalists that it's like my fleeting wish that my <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3519.807s">Sandra</a> graduates in 2029 sees the inside of something new before he leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3525.615s">So,</a> and everyone laughed, but I think they also knew I was serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3531.422s">And</a> I think for all of us, particularly those people who have kids in this building now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3537.349s">Every</a> day is like one day that we shouldn't have to wait, you know, we don't want to have to wait anymore right so the question in my mind is how do we accelerate this process as best we can, so that we can spend time in the part of the process where time needs to be spent, which is going to be this design, this design phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3556.117s">So</a> I did ask left field to give us a like most aggressive path scenario to getting the designer on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3566.402s">So</a> I'm going to let them talk a little bit about the process, because it's quite different than what we just did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3572.304s">There's</a> some similarities, but the selection process is quite different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3575.786s">So</a> do you want to take it away, and then we can talk about questions about the draft at RFS that we sent out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3849.674s">And</a> I think one of the things that wasn't immediately clear to me about how different this is, is this panel of 13, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3857.861s">will</a> pick our designer and we have three seats at that table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3863.582s">The</a> other 10 seats are MSBA seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3867.923s">So</a> people who don't live in Medford have no connection to us, but obviously have connections in the industry and are representatives of MSBA because they will play a significant financial role in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3882.836s">they</a> will have more votes than Medford does and who the designer ultimately is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3889.098s">So,</a> and I think the other thing that wasn't clear to me necessarily like at the beginning because it is like a complete departure from what we just did, is that those three seats <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3900.062s">for</a> Medford are the mayor, the superintendent, and one designee from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3905.364s">So</a> that is how the team gets formed from Medford's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3910.847s">And</a> then they are participants in this broader panel of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=3916.629s">And</a> the panel makes the decision about who our designer will ultimately be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4107.767s">So</a> you're welcome to attend even if Medford is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4111.208s">There's</a> no input though.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4113.829s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4115.829s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4825.01s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4827.651s">Any</a> other questions about anything you've heard so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4833.481s">So</a> you all should have received the marked up copy of <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4838.575s">the</a> RFS that we ultimately need to prepare to send to MSBA to get that designer selection out on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4849.578s">A</a> couple of notes about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4852.998s">As</a> Linda said, there's very little opportunity to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4857.279s">And</a> if you change something, they will tell you to change it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4862.24s">But</a> any place that <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4865.571s">was</a> for us to infuse information about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4869.753s">All</a> of that information is practically identical to what was published in our RFS to hire the OPM, which has already been vetted and approved by the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4881.199s">So</a> this came together so quickly because Matt is dedicated to our project, but also because he had lots of good material to work with to actually sort of infuse <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4894.306s">the</a> Medford specifics into this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4896.627s">So</a> having said all of that, changes are welcome, as long as you're not asking me to change something that MSBA doesn't allow us to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4906.19s">But</a> I did want to ask this group, as you review this, do you have questions or things you would like to see us tweak in here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4916.313s">And</a> or are you ready to take a vote to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4921.455s">So</a> first questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4989.368s">So</a> we allowed the OPMs three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4993.111s">So</a> we provided the same quick timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4997.033s">and</a> we had 10 respondents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5000.457s">I</a> believe there were probably some architects in the like ether during our <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5007.555s">during</a> our tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5008.456s">I</a> don't know who they were, but they're already here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5012.959s">They're</a> watching our meetings and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5016.242s">And</a> when I told the MSBA that we had 10 respondents, they were like, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5021.626s">So</a> that even seemed like a lot of interest to what they typically see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5027.351s">So</a> I think the three weeks <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5029.695s">didn't</a> harm us in the OPM selection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5033.256s">So</a> that's like the data point I can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5036.438s">But</a> you all might have some other data to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5039.599s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5365.62s">And</a> Luke, based on your same question from the last RFS, I had a conversation with MSBA about that range, and we talked about the intention being that we don't know what this project exactly is, whether we're staying here, whether we're renovating, whether we're building something completely new, and so the range, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5386.757s">was</a> intended to reflect sort of our willingness and openness to hear what the options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5394.963s">And</a> the MSBA was completely satisfied with that answer and we moved right along. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5400.167s">So</a> I don't think that designers and, like you all saw that same number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5406.051s">I</a> hope that's what it said to you, but that certainly was the impression of everybody who came through the tour was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5413.877s">Yeah,</a> there's a lot of things that could happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5416.699s">That's</a> partly why it's so desirable, based on what people are telling us in these in the walkthroughs, like people are <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5425.62s">salivating</a> over this project because there's like something for literally everybody like, oh, if you like a tight site, we've got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5433.305s">If</a> you like a site that's surrounded by wetlands, we've got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5437.107s">Like</a> if you are like a logistics moving expert, this is the place for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5442.69s">Like</a> there's just something really, and you know, we have one egress. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5446.412s">We</a> have all these things that are like really appealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5448.974s">So</a> I think that that didn't, you know, we didn't get a single question about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5464.56s">I</a> think the question is, why would we do that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5471.523s">Sticker</a> shock to who?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5479.125s">We</a> aren't asking for tax increases right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5596.7s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5606.748s">The</a> motion is to change the language in the RFS so that the upper number in the RFS is $400 million instead of $600 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5616.997s">It's</a> just about what is being published in the RFS.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=5661.117s">So</a> that's about the same as our design enrollment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6214.826s">So</a> there is a motion on the floor, but there is not a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6218.848s">Is</a> there a second?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6225.158s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6225.399s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6225.699s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6225.919s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6226.119s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6226.339s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6226.62s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6226.84s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6227.04s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6227.901s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6228.161s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6228.481s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6228.781s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6229.021s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6229.222s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6229.502s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6230.042s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6230.923s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6231.283s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6231.483s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6231.743s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6231.984s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6233.104s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6234.045s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6234.626s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6234.886s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6235.486s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6236.247s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6237.207s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6237.568s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6237.888s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6238.208s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6238.488s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6238.769s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6239.149s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6240.85s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6241.17s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6241.371s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6241.571s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6242.752s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6242.992s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6243.592s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6244.233s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6244.493s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6244.833s">I'm</a> sorry.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6348.196s">So</a> this is just about the RFS to get the designer on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6352.781s">Our</a> communications team will help us with that, but we should not be saying this project will cost $600 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6359.509s">That's</a> not the intention of that number at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6363.294s">And</a> so we can certainly, you know, people have questions about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6366.536s">We</a> can certainly publish some FAQs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6368.717s">This</a> is, this is just part of the process, and it's a very, very early part of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6376.1s">Are</a> there any other questions, comments, thoughts about the RFS, Bill?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6390.587s">So</a> we'll align that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6391.708s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6398.203s">And</a> these represent like the fastest possible scenario, which will be contingent on whether MSBA has space for us in those timelines and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6410.632s">So</a> that timeline could change based on their feedback as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6415.756s">Are</a> there other changes to the RFS? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6420.74s">Is</a> there a motion to approve the RFS as amended? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6425.352s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6426.493s">By</a> Dr. Galusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6427.613s">Is</a> there a second?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6499.658s">That</a> is a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6502.822s">I</a> don't know the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6504.383s">Maybe</a> our left field friends can help us with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6507.086s">Can</a> you give us a sense of what we should expect as a team in terms of meeting going forward?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6666.199s">The</a> school committee votes on that, is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6668.501s">That's</a> correct, the school committee, not the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6671.242s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6702.302s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6702.962s">And</a> if the school committee needs to take action, I can give you- We will follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=6706.583s">We'll</a> be okay in June, so we'll be good there.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=477.693s">I</a> don't know if this is actually a question for you, but I was curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=483.375s">Number</a> six, the budget transfer will cover the need for sound system repair at the McGlynn Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=491.398s">Does</a> that bring it to full function? <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=494.639s">Because</a> I hear a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=497.431s">commentary</a> from families that that sound system is quite bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=501.973s">So</a> does this like fix it, fix it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=504.255s">Or</a> is this like a small minor thing?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=522.26s">And</a> I won't hold you to this number, but do you have any idea, like in a ballpark, is it like 5,000, is it 50,000, is it something in the middle?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=534.265s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=535.566s">I</a> have had people interested in what it would take to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=539.968s">So</a> that's why I'm asking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=595.445s">OK,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=596.225s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=597.827s">And</a> motion to approve the budget transfers.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=689.959s">to</a> one question and maybe one comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=694.16s">So</a> this year, what we did was we put a third date in June on the calendar so that there's space on the calendar for what may need to happen, which we would then cancel if we don't need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=709.163s">And</a> I was wondering if we should do the same for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=712.823s">I</a> just know when we get to the end of the year, it is impossible to <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=717.842s">wedge</a> things into the calendar versus like if it's there, we know what we can plan for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=722.566s">So</a> I was wondering if we could amend this to add June 15th if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=729.13s">And</a> I think it's fine to say if necessary, but that we might want that and thank ourselves in the, our future selves might thank us if we put it on the calendar now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=743.261s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=745.297s">And</a> then the other question I had was whether these dates line up with our budget process policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=754.607s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=755.248s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=755.588s">They</a> absolutely do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=756.489s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=759.913s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=760.374s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=790.981s">to</a> give this committee a quick update on where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=793.704s">So</a> we have been working since our invitation to the feasibility study to secure what is called an owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=804.156s">And</a> that process started with having to take some boilerplate documents, <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=812.325s">infuse</a> our Medford specific things and then go through all of the procurement hoops that are required by both the city's procurement team and the MSBA to push out a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=825.411s">So</a> we put out what they call an RFS, which is a request for services. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=829.594s">And</a> we did a walkthrough at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=831.935s">We</a> had a good attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=832.895s">There</a> were like 15 or 20 people there from various organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=837.117s">walking</a> through just to get a feel for the building itself and get to hear some information from us, although it was not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=846.403s">And</a> then they were asked to submit their proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=851.271s">And</a> we received 10 proposals, which everyone says, wow, it sounds like that's actually a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=858.158s">Like</a> everybody, yes, apparently it's very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=860.78s">And</a> people even on the tour were just so interested in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=867.307s">Like</a> this is a very desirable project in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=871.711s">And</a> I think it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=873.092s">It</a> has something for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=874.593s">If</a> you like space challenges, we've got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=877.734s">If</a> you like having to not disrupt vocational programs, we've got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=884.436s">There's</a> something for everyone in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=886.376s">So</a> from the perspective of people who do this for a living, I think it's a very desirable project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=894.459s">So</a> we got 10 RFSs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=897.12s">Last</a> week, the OPM selection subcommittee met with three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=903.622s">And</a> we met each of them on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=907.725s">So</a> it was a very long day on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=911.567s">The</a> ultimate winner of that evaluation process was unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=921.452s">We</a> had three really good options, but one just sort of stood a little head and shoulders above the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=929.496s">Um,</a> their name is left field. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=931.857s">They</a> are OPMs by trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=933.537s">So</a> there's lots of organizations out there that do OPM services and they do other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=938.338s">I</a> believe left field is just an OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=940.679s">That's</a> what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=941.979s">This</a> is their passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=943.039s">Um,</a> they will bring a team to Medford, um, upon like sort of all these final steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=949.621s">Um,</a> but our recommendation to MSBA is that we'll work with left field. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=953.542s">So</a> we're, um, working through the final, um, back and forth on the contract negotiation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=960.124s">The</a> building committee will meet next Monday, and actually get to meet the team from left field. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=966.249s">So</a> if anybody, it's an open meeting so if people would like to join us they're welcome to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=970.433s">And</a> then all our paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=973.816s">I</a> think it's six, and we're still trying to look, find a location because the bistro. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=979.927s">is</a> booked. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=980.708s">So,</a> but by Wednesday of this week, we will have to submit our recommendation and our request to work with left field to MSBA, along with a whole slew of other paperwork to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=999.556s">outline</a> the process that we went through and turn over all the documentation that they require. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1004.579s">And</a> that deadline will put us on track for going to what they call the OPM selection panel in early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1014.906s">I</a> believe it's June 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1017.587s">And</a> at that meeting, presuming that MSBA is in agreement with our selection, they will give us the green light. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1025.932s">We</a> will execute the contract and we will <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1028.814s">begin</a> work immediately, very immediately, to bring on the designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1035.261s">So</a> that is the architect who will actually do the feasibility study and grapple with all of the cool, interesting, really challenging things that will go into making decisions about what the future of the building looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1051.416s">So</a> that's really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1053.658s">When</a> we met with all three vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1057.96s">I</a> opened with saying that I am hopeful that my eighth grader sees the inside of something new before he graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1066.904s">So</a> I think they understand our urgency quite clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1069.466s">And</a> even, we were able to have a lot of dialogue with all of the bidders but with left hand specifically to really impress upon them, just how overdue this is in Medford and that we're very aware that every day that we wait means this will cost more. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1088.095s">So</a> they are already thinking about how to accelerate the work that has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1095.758s">Some</a> of it can't be accelerated, but where we can accelerate things like paperwork and getting through gates, we're ready to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1105.922s">And</a> they were just all for the energy that we imparted on them about what we are trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1112.184s">So</a> it was exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1114.065s">The</a> team is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1116.986s">They</a> provide a project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1119.767s">There's</a> actually two on our project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1121.648s">One</a> is more communications and engagement focused, and the other is more construction focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1128.472s">They</a> seem like a very good team. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1129.733s">They</a> have a lot of nice energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1131.614s">There's</a> an educational consultant who was the principal of a vocational school, maybe a superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1137.637s">I</a> can't remember, superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1141.019s">Along</a> with another, you know, any other number of credentials I think she was a special educator to start like she's sort of got lots and lots of good history behind her to help advise from an educational planning perspective, which is an important part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1158.174s">And</a> then there's, you know, we got to meet the people who will be on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1162.478s">when</a> there's construction going on, you know, and everybody just really knew their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1167.08s">So</a> it was really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1168.72s">And</a> if you all would like to join us on Monday, you can meet them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1175.823s">So</a> our next thing is to work with, to get through this gate and then work with left field to issue a similar request for services for the designer, which is the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1189.848s">That</a> selection process is quite different than what we've just done, so we'll learn more about that as we go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1227.923s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1229.024s">The</a> big thing is to get the designer on board, because they need to be part of those engaged discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1237.851s">So</a> my goal would be that we use the summer for what I would call paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1243.035s">It's</a> more than paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1243.796s">But</a> for the not engaging part of this process, but to fill out the team, get that designer on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1253.504s">If</a> we can line up to the gates and stages that are <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1257.751s">outlined</a> with MSBA so that come September, we're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1261.532s">So</a> in the early fall, we wanna be ready to be having those kinds of community conversations that can't happen until the designer's on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1269.914s">So</a> the OPM will be very involved in that, but they can't do it without the designer because then we would just have to redo it and that would cost more money.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1281.457s">We</a> do, and they had, <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1283.719s">They</a> had already like watched all of those meetings, of course, and they knew that we had a website they had already seen it so they're ready to bolster like on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1294.556s">The</a> other thing that I appreciated that they talked a lot about is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1298.662s">community</a> engagement now is not just about hearing whether people want to pool or don't want to pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1305.143s">That's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1306.783s">But</a> it's also important for the community engagement to start now so that we are building community interest in the project in the lead up to what will be a debt exclusion vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1317.425s">So</a> they're very tuned in to the fact that they play a really, really important role in helping us tell this story again and again and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1327.687s">in</a> all kinds of different ways in the lead up to what ultimately will be a really big ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1333.369s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1338.911s">I</a> just want to thank the selection team who accommodated my awful schedule last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1343.932s">And</a> it was a very, very long day on Wednesday, but we got it done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1405.574s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1406.174s">I</a> would like to nominate Russo to be our delegate. <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1409.375s">He</a> loves this activity so much.<h2><a href="../2025-04-14_Q8tZvOlAobY/2025-04-14_Q8tZvOlAobY.html">Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=299.034s">And</a> the presentation has been updated with the corrected rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=304.597s">So</a> if you all can take a look at the screens rather than your handout, that's probably the most accurate picture at this moment.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=529.803s">And</a> member Reinfeld, I do know that last year, I believe last year was the first year that we started doing chargeback to certain revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=539.426s">And</a> this was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=540.807s">This</a> was one of the accounts that already has sort of ingested a chargeback model. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=547.729s">So</a> yeah, and for that point, Kids Corner is as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=550.87s">Terrific,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=553.391s">Member</a> Ruseau.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1172.858s">Member</a> Reinfeld, if I could potentially offer a friendly amendment to this motion, I think it is certainly well time to do this, and we've sort of been dancing around it for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1187.171s">I</a> do wonder if bringing this data back to this committee will, like in this sort of broader sense, will <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1197.199s">necessitate</a> us having to send it somewhere else anyway, because there's a lot of work to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1201.74s">And</a> our subcommittees are intended to be working committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1205.301s">So</a> I did have a suggestion, if you are interested, that this be referred to the strategic planning subcommittee, where some of these community-based conversations can be had in advance of all this information coming back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1221.685s">Because</a> we typically have a really <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1223.825s">ambitious</a> agenda and don't have time to dig in in those kinds of ways on the floor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1228.891s">So</a> that was just my suggestion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1299.247s">So</a> I think the question is like, can you bring the short-term solution here without that larger conversation around the long-term? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1309.115s">Is</a> that the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1309.775s">That</a> is the question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1397.699s">Okay,</a> so there is a motion on the floor as amended that this data will go to the strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1410.265s">Motion</a> by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1411.685s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1412.005s">Is</a> there a second by Member Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1414.095s">roll</a> call please.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5671.765s">I</a> really want that kindergarten class to be fixed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5682.463s">And</a> I guess the other thing worth mentioning is with this list of changes that we're not going to pursue at this time like I do think the director of facilities and the to be assistant director of facilities needs to have that list so that the next time we get a deal on toilet paper and somebody comes to install <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5704.695s">you</a> know, new containers for toilet paper that we're, like, hawking them to do it right and in compliance every single time we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5715.057s">Like,</a> I know from time to time, the maintenance team has to rebuild a bathroom for a variety of reasons, and if they have to do it anyway, they should be doing it in a way that sort of brings us to where we, you know, where we want to be, because those things are small, but they matter to people who need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5734.102s">um</a> I just want to make sure that it's on it it doesn't like go in the project file and go in a filing cabinet and instead it is very in a very real way still on our radar um as we move forward beyond this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5750.526s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2058.691s">So</a> would it be possible then for in the budget list to show us <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2067.163s">You</a> know, like I'm looking at school committees sort of a bad example but central office office of the superintendent, it says eight so for FY 20 sorry six. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2074.868s">We're</a> planning have six people for FY 26, would it be possible to like add a column there to say for FY 25, it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2082.673s">six,</a> or it was eight, or it was 10, or some way to be able to see that, like department to department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2089.236s">Okay,</a> that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2091.577s">I</a> did also notice, or actually a resident pointed out to me that at the Brooks and the Missittuck, there appear to be two Nexus teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2099.081s">Is</a> that correct versus just one?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2126.159s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2127.039s">It</a> looks like there's two at the Brooks, two at the Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2131.941s">I</a> see one at Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2134.281s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2137.127s">trying</a> to find the McGlynn number to see if there was one there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2140.128s">So</a> there just may be a misclassification there, potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2145.369s">Oh,</a> here's McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2149.83s">One.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2150.21s">So</a> there's something strange at Brooks and Miss Suttuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2156.091s">There,</a> if you could check into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2158.951s">And</a> then the other thing that I think would be helpful for us to be able to see on this <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2168.11s">on</a> this page or something like it, this like overall department is for the upcoming budget year of this number, like how much is staff and how much is everything else?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2073.533s">Thank</a> you, so I just wanted to add a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2077.801s">So</a> Monday night, our budget hearing is simply to frame our request to the municipal budget right to the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2085.316s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2086.277s">This</a> is where we're saying to everyone, including the council and the mayor, and I know you're here, but this is what we believe that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2096.763s">That</a> 5.5% increase is actually not different than what our increase was outlined in Chapter 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2107.668s">So</a> when I looked at the Chapter 70 numbers, <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2111.33s">They</a> outlined that our portion would be going up by 5.5% or something like roughly there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2119.236s">So</a> that number is consistent with even what the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2123.619s">Outlined</a> that our number would look like right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2128.522s">It's</a> more complicated than that, but I think directionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2132.685s">That</a> number is not like, sort of out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2137.937s">The</a> budget process that we've laid out has another step later in probably May and into June to get to full reconciliation of what the municipal government is able to provide, which may require changes to what we outline and approve as our request, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2161.701s">So</a> this is our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2163.382s">There's</a> a step two that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2166.054s">If</a> our request is different than what the city ultimately can provide based on what the mayor recommends based on what the council proves, then we have to take another vote to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2175.46s">Like,</a> a balanced budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2178.522s">The</a> other thing that I'll mention, because we do have so many new members is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2182.304s">Anytime</a> that we are in active negotiations with the teachers union in particular, this time in the budget is as uncertain as it can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2194.768s">Because</a> out of our 800-ish staff, almost 500 of them sit in the teachers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2202.411s">So</a> without clarity on that just yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2207.484s">Um,</a> there's a lot of uncertainty that between now and June, hopefully fingers crossed, we will, like, get to certainty on and, like, put, you know, have a path forward that will allow us to refine this number with facts instead of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2221.753s">You</a> know, just like we heard from Bob last night, like, we're planning, but these numbers are sort of always changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2227.597s">So</a> I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2229.99s">When</a> I remember going through this process a few years back, where we were at the end of a teacher contract, it was the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2237.892s">Sort</a> of way, I'm certain feeling about, like, what was going to happen and where it was going to land. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2243.993s">So,</a> I guess, like, overall, I just want to make sure that the people who are listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2249.554s">Understand</a> that a, this is a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2252.813s">B,</a> there is a reconciliation process, and C, the uncertainty that Jerry's having to deal with right now is likely to continue to change between requests and balanced budget and come into focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2273.267s">So</a> all of that to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2277.67s">Thank</a> you, Jerry, for putting this together, because it allows us to see what the totality of the situation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2284.473s">And</a> I think for a really, really long time, the school committee never got to see what the totality of the situation was and it led to things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2295.097s">Underfunded</a> maintenance budgets chronically that we're now trying to peel out of so. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2300.232s">This,</a> I don't I don't think this is a, like, a wild budget in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2305.536s">And</a> I also don't think that it's like a final, like, catastrophic. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2312.241s">Number,</a> I just think, like, this is where we are in the process and. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2318.142s">I'm</a> glad that we're talking in plain language about what we believe that the district needs to serve students because that is a piece that was so missing for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2328.548s">And</a> now we can together make the decisions that we need to make between now and the end of June to get where we need to go and to get to that balanced budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2339.273s">I</a> just want to say thanks to Jerry he did a really great job, especially with like all the uncertainty that exists for us right now and it's not it's not just the teachers contract we have five contracts renewing on July one so there's a lot there's a lot of moving parts that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2357.63s">He</a> can't his crystal balls probably is broken his mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2361.611s">So</a> it's really hard to know, like, where all of those things will land, but we're trying to work through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2367.893s">So</a> I just wanted to lay that out there, both from a process perspective and from a, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2373.435s">Yes,</a> this is uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2375.116s">Yes,</a> this looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2376.716s">Maybe</a> alarming, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2379.697s">I,</a> I do think, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2382.54s">It's</a> like the right place to be in March, which is, by the way, earlier than we've ever been in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2387.161s">So</a> all things considered, like, I'm calling tonight a win, even if it's not like a perfect slam dunk, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2395.923s">Like,</a> I think we're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2398.924s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-19_Aod_AldxCno/2025-03-19_Aod_AldxCno.html">Joint Meeting of the Medford City Council and Medford School Committee to Discuss FY 26 Budget</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4001.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4001.981s">Are</a> there any other questions from the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4007.758s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you, Director Dickinson and Nina for obliging us and helping put this meeting together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4016.58s">I</a> think it's really important that we all hear a picture of what the city's finances are, so I'm really glad that we're here doing this, creating a space to talk plainly about the plain numbers, even though there's lots of them, so that when people have questions, there's a place that we can point them to to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4038.065s">We</a> collectively, as the elected officials in Medford, are proactively asking for this information and getting this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4044.869s">And</a> to President Bears' point, there's an incredible amount of accounting and detail that has to be provided in the spirit of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4054.835s">So</a> I think that's always really important to reinforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4057.797s">So</a> I'm just glad that we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4059.838s">I'm</a> glad that it's only been about an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4062.32s">And</a> I just wanted to say thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4080.154s">We</a> do have to adjourn twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4081.915s">So</a> there's a motion from the school committee to adjourn by Mr. Sorry, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4185.743s">So</a> the school committee has a motion to adjourn by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4188.825s">Is</a> there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4190.477s">seconded</a> by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4192.878s">Member</a> Ruseau, can you call the roll?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4208.285s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4211.747s">Six</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4213.288s">The</a> motion passes.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=67.394s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=67.975s">Can</a> you hear me?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=299.997s">Yes,</a> there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=300.997s">Dr.</a> Cushing, this language that you've shared with me, I'm just going to pop in the chat.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=307.979s">And</a> I'm happy to read it out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=309.379s">But</a> I think the other piece of context for all of this, just so that if anybody else is listening besides the committee that's sort of been through all this with us, when we looked at the capital plan, which we approved back in December, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=326.231s">December,</a> I believe it was December in that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=330.393s">We</a> made recommendations to pursue these accelerated repair applications when the window opened, because at that time, what we did know is this window is open again for the 1st time in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=346.68s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=347.22s">I</a> think it was open last year, potentially, but was closed to us when we would have needed to use it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=356.404s">Um,</a> the McGlynn Andrews project, and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=361.227s">The</a> is doing a lot to try to combat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=364.689s">Like,</a> the sort of skyrocketing cost of construction across all of their projects, which is what led to them freezing this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=372.875s">So</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=374.216s">seems</a> like it's the first program to freeze when something happens that is unexpected and I'm glad that we have this window open that we might be successful with one or multiple of these projects because at best if everything goes as planned this will not come around again for two years which means we would not know an answer for three years which means we're probably looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=403.507s">5</a> years from now that, like, these things would be repaired and replaced and I am really worried based on what I hear about the. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=412.732s">Things</a> like the roofs and the HVACs from the process that we've been going through with McGlynn and doing these many assessments to figure out how to submit these applications that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=424.057s">sometime</a> between now and five years from now like we are going to be looking at all of these projects as non-optional projects so um i i know dr cushing has been like really hustling to get this done in collaboration with some of the team that is working on mclenny andrews um and just sort of trying to position us to take advantage of a potential grant so thank you dr cushing for <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=451.132s">Um,</a> for doing that, and I will, I'll read this and I will also pop it in the chat.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=486.152s">Thank</a> you, which made it really easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=488.412s">So</a> I didn't have to come up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=491.453s">So</a> I will make a motion that reads having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford school committee of the city of Medford in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances has voted to authorize a superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts school building authority, the statement of interest form dated March, 2025 for the Roberts elementary school <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=516.621s">located</a> at, what is the exact address? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=522.703s">35</a> Court Street, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=523.863s">I</a> think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=526.784s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=528.684s">Court</a> Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=535.646s">02155,</a> which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which the application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=544.219s">Priority</a> 5 replacement, renovation or modern modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=556.166s">This</a> work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=564.951s">In</a> particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=572.878s">The</a> roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness, and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=592.294s">or</a> commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=601.88s">And</a> here it comes in the chat.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=636.612s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=638.913s">It</a> is in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=640.254s">So</a> what I just read, we can share with you if that works.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=666.854s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=698.129s">Yeah,</a> it's the same exact resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=700.871s">You</a> can read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=702.844s">Having</a> convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=708.409s">Prior</a> to the submission closing date, the city council of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=713.593s">Sorry,</a> this is the wrong 1. hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=716.255s">I'm</a> in the wrong place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=717.336s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=721.239s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=730.188s">At</a> the Medford School Committee of the city of Medford, in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances, has voted to authorize the superintendent to submit the Massachusetts School Building Authority Statement of Interest Form dated March 2025 for the Mississauga Elementary School, 37 Hicks Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=745.693s">02155,</a> which describes and explains the following deficiencies and priority categories for which an application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=754.476s">Priority</a> five is replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=759.138s">including</a> the roof, which is approaching 25 years old, and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=764.6s">The</a> work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the City of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=772.262s">In</a> particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=780.184s">The</a> roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=783.62s">And</a> hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, that Massachusetts in no way guarantees the acceptance or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, any funding commitment to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, or commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=816.357s">That's</a> because there's votes that have to be taken by the council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=819.738s">So</a> you just need to go to the school committee section. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=822.578s">Excellent.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=968.404s">Just</a> a note for everybody that these do also need to be approved by the council and Dr. Cushing is working on a submission to them in time for their meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=983.171s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=983.712s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Cushing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2831.622s">Thank</a> you, I just I saw I got a couple of questions related to this from a constituent and on the same day, I saw 1 of our representatives post about this very topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2846.874s">So</a> I just dug up her post and I'm going to put it in the chat to sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2853.764s">frame</a> like how does money come to us like there's very little money that comes directly to us directly from the feds um so um i just thought this was like a helpful context oh it's too big um i'm just going to give you the facebook link i guess because i can't give you the whole quote um but um <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2879.893s">I</a> find her to be very helpful and factual in her understanding of how school funding works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2888.861s">She's</a> sort of a legend in Massachusetts, and she should be in a much more broad way than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2895.087s">I</a> don't know if that will actually take you to her post. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2900.212s">Let</a> me, I will send it to you all separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2906.474s">And</a> her name is Tracy O'Connell Novick, and she is a wealth of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2912.456s">So</a> I'm happy to read it to you all, but she basically, she says, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2921.775s">that</a> something I see a lot, perhaps, of people perhaps simply not knowing how federal aid to school districts works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2927.84s">In</a> the vast majority of cases, federal aid to school districts goes through state ed agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2932.483s">There</a> are some exceptions, and this doesn't, for example, speak to DOD schools or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2938.288s">Districts</a> are not on their own, though, for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2940.369s">Your</a> federal aid is conditioned on written agreements between the state and federal governments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2944.292s">There</a> is no TAP that runs directly to your school district, and thus, this isn't every little school district's fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2954.571s">You</a> know, the world changes, like, every minute right now, but that is helpful context. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2962.434s">So</a> for all of our, like, wishes about what Dessie might do differently in the world right now, I think we're all on that same side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2975.198s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5377.074s">Yep.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=212.912s">I</a> just put it in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=215.674s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3231.962s">Just</a> another small clarification before Dr. Cushing dives in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3237.146s">The</a> school committee is required to approve all job descriptions and we have not had a wonderful history of doing that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3251.238s">So</a> part of <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3253.039s">This</a> is to get back on track around making sure that there are controls in place about our job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3260.803s">So,</a> I know that the job for the facilities director has been filled for quite some time, but I would also bet money that at that time, the job description didn't come before the school committee because that wasn't part of the typical pathway at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3278.199s">So</a> I think we're going to approve both tonight or amend and approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3283.623s">And</a> I agree, I think it's really important to know how these two positions are supposed to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3288.685s">And</a> I do have a couple of questions once Dr. Cushing goes through this one, whenever you're ready, Mayor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3316.183s">How</a> did it come up so tiny?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3849.26s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3851.742s">Thank</a> you, so I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3854.564s">Pop</a> a couple of changes into the document that you saw in red line, but the 1 I wanted to call out was this the bullet under. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3868.293s">Under</a> 1st, section qualifications, or it should be available in an on call manner 24 hours per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3874.277s">I.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3878.715s">My</a> fear is that nobody will want this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3882.578s">So</a> my suggestion is that we instead say be available to promptly address planned and unplanned needs across school property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3890.684s">I'm</a> just going to pop that in the chat if everyone is okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3896.809s">I</a> think that's probably slightly better language. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3901.601s">And,</a> uh, I'm just looking to see if there were any other, um, questions or comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3907.403s">Um,</a> I had, I did have a comment also under essential functions where we say, um, manage the annual service contract process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3915.707s">Um,</a> I know that we are trying to implement service contract, like preventative maintenance service contracts that will be managed by this team, but we also have a contract cleaning service and my suggestion, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3929.792s">It</a> is for Dr. Cushing to separate those two things out so they are different line items because they're completely different kinds of work, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3944.165s">Managing</a> a contract cleaner, I know there's a contracting piece of that, but that's about day-to-day, daily, nightly performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3954.852s">of</a> the contract cleaner versus like the monthly pest control folks or, or whatever those other, um, maintenance contracts will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3964.076s">So</a> those would be my two suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3965.977s">Um,</a> and I'd be happy to make a motion to approve as amended unless there are other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3972.2s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4055.2s">I</a> think we're sort of splitting hairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4058.402s">This</a> is a management level position and people applying for these kinds of positions understand that they are expected to be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4067.109s">So</a> what if we said be available <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4070.432s">for</a> on-call support and to promptly address planned and unplanned needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4075.133s">I</a> just am trying to get away from 24 hours a day, seven days a week language. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4079.755s">That's</a> the part that, like, if I was reading that as an applicant, what I would be worried about is how many people work for this place? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4086.997s">Am</a> I going to be called to do every last little thing that goes wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4090.077s">Like,</a> there's a lot of variability in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4094.859s">So</a> I feel like maybe if we merge the two together, we'll get to the spirit of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4113.473s">Putting</a> it in the chat.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4258.003s">Yeah,</a> the facilities director is our liaison for MSBA today, and I would expect that that would continue to be true, particularly because the facilities director in this, like, two-prong process, the facilities director has responsibility over the maintenance staff directly versus the custodial staff will sit with the assistant director. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4279.696s">So</a> I do think, like, that special projects piece belongs in the facilities director, and I would also say <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4288.701s">just</a> as a matter of like good form for job descriptions, it would also say other job-related responsibilities as assigned so that it's clear that this is not like a finite list of what could happen in the job as time goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4310.307s">So</a> I would be happy to add those two amendments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4324.33s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4327.053s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4338.703s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4341.225s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4383.927s">I</a> thought I was, I was just going to be my responsibility director.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4404.774s">I</a> had a couple of suggestions on this one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4408.916s">In</a> the section, sorry, I'm just looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4431.526s">In</a> the essential functions section, there's a bullet about halfway down this is assist in the construction of weather mitigation plans, including snow and ice operations that account for equipment personnel training and materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4448.615s">And</a> I think the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4451.48s">I</a> think it would be assist in the development of a weather mitigation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4456.428s">And</a> then I would also suggest that there be another sentence added to that that says, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4464.941s">Something</a> about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4466.957s">enacting</a> the weather mitigation plans as appropriate, like, when needed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4474.16s">So</a> it's 1 thing to have an overarching plan that says this is how we're going to handle these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4479.722s">And</a> then when events happen, we have to actually do the thing that we put in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4485.704s">So</a> I would just clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4497.287s">The</a> other change is the same language about the 24-7 language, which Dr. Cushing may have already gotten.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4514.892s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4515.892s">And</a> that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4533.684s">I'm</a> happy to make a motion to approve unless my colleagues have other questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4704.983s">I'm</a> happy to make a motion to approve if there are no other comments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4722.982s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4725.503s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5174.458s">Hi,</a> I just wanted to thank Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing and Dr. Glusi for hopping on the phone with Jesse. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5184.865s">It's</a> a pretty standard part of the MSBA process where, because we had chapter 74 programs, and we were talking about expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5193.991s">MSBA</a> passes our paperwork essentially over to DESE and then it's pretty standard part of the process where they meet and say, what are you thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5203.856s">What's</a> happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5204.496s">What</a> happens next? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5205.497s">That</a> kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5206.197s">So</a> that's where this conversation happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5208.018s">So</a> it's a pretty routine part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5211.78s">We</a> will need to take a vote tonight so that I can pass that back to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5216.763s">And</a> the Chapter 74 form can be updated, which Dr. Cushing and I will handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5223.007s">But</a> I just wanted to say, like, I think this is exactly what the process is supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5229.01s">It's</a> supposed to say, like, explore, think about the things that you want to know more about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5234.234s">And</a> then, you know, you sort of triangulate it and fine-tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5240.001s">I</a> have a sister who is a vet, and I was like, oh, veterinary science sounds like a thing that could happen without lots and lots of animals at this stage, like in these early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5252.191s">And</a> then when we talked to Desi, they were like, no, no, you need to have animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5255.894s">And</a> it's like, OK, that's really not where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5261.578s">At</a> any rate, the process was very smooth, DESI was very collaborative, they were excited about the other expansions that we talked about and I have a motion when people are done with their questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5285.36s">So</a> I did, I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5287.642s">And</a> I will put it in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5289.543s">Oh,</a> that's not the right language. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5293.806s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5297.508s">The</a> motion is to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5300.743s">remove</a> veterinary science from exploration and adjust the expansion timelines for dental assisting criminal justice, protective services, plumbing, HVAC and information systems per the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5313.987s">So</a> I just put that in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5318.009s">And</a> so there's, so basically because we sent this initial presentation to MSBA, we will have to make, send them the update and be able to clarify for them what changes happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5328.092s">And</a> this motion will do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5460.931s">We've</a> got a lot of policies to read tonight, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5474.294s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=54.209s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=55.09s">I'm</a> Jenny Graham. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=56.11s">I'm</a> the vice chair of the school committee, and I'm a Medford mom.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=91.982s">So</a> I am looking forward to eating at Mrs. Murphy's, which I know will be opening like any day now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=101.568s">So</a> I don't know what my favorite thing to eat will be there just yet, but I'm really excited to have another fabulous restaurant in the square.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=160.341s">On</a> January 13, the school committee heard a proposal from the administration that outlined their proposal for spending the money from question 7 and question 8 in this fiscal year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=177.815s">So</a> as you probably have heard, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=183.739s">override</a> was retroactive back to July 1. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=187.98s">So</a> that is part of why people felt a bigger impact on their tax bills this quarter, because we were essentially only spreading over two bills what normally would be spread over four. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=204.725s">And</a> there's a whole bunch of other things that went on with the assessments, which I won't get into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=208.846s">But</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=211.347s">At</a> any rate, the 7M dollars between the 2 questions is available to us this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=218.632s">So,</a> what we've heard about on January 13th was the proposal for, like, how to do that spending in this fiscal year and because it's the 1st year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=229.28s">So</a> right off the top, we knew and were reminded that the city advanced Medford Public Schools $1.75 million. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=238.969s">So</a> that $7 million comes down to 5.25. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=243.414s">So</a> when the administration came before us, they were really dealing with that $5.25 million pot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=252.383s">So</a> we went through that presentation and I'm happy to talk about the highlights and big elements of what we agreed to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=260.251s">Their</a> recommendation was approved unanimously by the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=263.875s">So</a> that spending is already being put into action based on what we agreed to on January 13th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=271.383s">There</a> is a piece of the $5.25 million that has not yet been allocated from a spending perspective. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=279.105s">So</a> it is within Medford Public Schools to spend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=282.926s">We</a> have not yet heard a proposal for the whole $5.25 million. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=287.487s">The</a> reason being is that some portion of that money <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=292.748s">Um,</a> is allocated under the under the law, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=296.756s">To</a> be restricted to supporting some of the schedule changes that we outlined as the reason for doing the override. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=304.688s">So</a> we are working right now actively with our bargaining partners in the union to talk about what that piece looks like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=312.052s">So</a> we'll hear another presentation about what the district is recommending based on those negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=318.375s">And</a> based on that, the school committee will have to approve the spending that gets proposed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=323.918s">So</a> we'll hear about that maybe, like, in another month or so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=328.023s">And</a> then from there, right then, then we really quickly are in year 2. so all of this money will be folded in to the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=337.186s">When</a> we talk about our operating budget for fiscal 26, which starts on July 1. so this this sort of, like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=346.135s">starting</a> point this fiscal year is a little bit unusual because it's a mid-year infusion and an ability to do some things that we didn't know that we were going to be able to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=358.078s">Once</a> we get into the next budget cycle it will be wrapped in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=360.999s">So</a> essentially whatever our budget was comes up by seven million dollars and then we will still expect that the city provide an increase to our budget for next fiscal year as they the city does.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=383.072s">So,</a> led by the superintendent and the director of finance, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=387.274s">They</a> sit down really with their, with their leadership team, the assistant superintendents, building principles, et cetera and say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=394.456s">You</a> know, and this is typical of any budget cycle where they sit down and say, what do we need? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=401.139s">Like,</a> what are the proposals? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=402.339s">What.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=403.26s">Has</a> to happen next year that's not happening this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=408.239s">that</a> is going to cost mon budget for and get approv we need to stop doing? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=411.142s">Wh</a> anymore? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=411.923s">What</a> should we n So every every year, even <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=425.337s">you</a> you should see like savings proposals and spending proposals right and hopefully those things sort of work in concert with each other um so you don't get to crisis which we've been there we've done that hopefully we're charting a better path yeah so my second question was um i think in some of the uh support of the override there was a talk about like if this doesn't pass teachers losing jobs so what are we what's happening there <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=453.262s">Um,</a> so if the override didn't pass, the biggest thing that would have happened is that advance from the city would have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=461.246s">Been</a> in question, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=462.386s">So</a> the city advanced 1.75M dollars and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=463.967s">That</a> allowed us to save positions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=471.97s">in</a> this fiscal year, that without that advance, we would have had to cut last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=477.274s">So</a> had the override not passed, those positions would again be on the chopping block to be eliminated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=484.96s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=491.545s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=492.325s">Or</a> we were planning for a successful override, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=496.128s">So</a> that money, what that money was used to fund was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=502.29s">half</a> a million dollars to update our technology portfolio, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=509.877s">So</a> if you think about Chromebooks, they have a very short shelf life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=513.541s">They're</a> not expensive, but there's a lot of them in the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=517.124s">And</a> we have never in Medford Public Schools had a replacement budget for technology. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=522.109s">So</a> anytime we needed to replace technology, it was like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=527.663s">Really,</a> really hard a really, really hard to do, or we waited for it to be so bad that we would then go and say to the city, like, we need this huge amount of free cash. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=539.331s">To</a> fix our technology situation, what. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=543.714s">A</a> district needs to do in this day and age is have a replacement budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=547.056s">So</a> we now do so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=550.253s">In</a> FY24, we did not have a replacement budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=553.816s">We</a> had some other sources that we were using to plug that gap. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=558.44s">That</a> went away with the pandemic funds expiring. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=562.423s">So</a> now, going forward, we have a half million dollar technology replacement budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=566.786s">So</a> that's one big thing that happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=569.769s">And</a> if the override hadn't passed, we would again be in a situation where we could not replace our technology to the tune of a half a million dollars a year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=578.796s">So</a> that's a big deal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=580.117s">The</a> other thing that money that advance allowed us to do was keep 14 positions that would otherwise have been cut at the end of last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=590.796s">So</a> we would have seen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=593.68s">two</a> elementary school teachers, two high school teachers, two literacy coaches, one nurse, four curriculum administrators, and three behavior specialists. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=605.214s">Their</a> positions would have been eliminated on June 30th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=608.218s">We</a> saved them with the advance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=610.201s">Now</a> they can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=612.025s">now</a> we can not worry about having to save them again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=615.268s">That</a> becomes permanent and not just in advance anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=619.413s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=977.691s">Yeah,</a> and I think, you know, the interesting thing about sort of what you see on TV or on Zoom versus like how things happen, it's just, there's sort of two worlds that collide, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=993.422s">And</a> when we talk about like how a budget gets prepared, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=998.442s">It's</a> really easy to be like, well, the administration does or doesn't like this thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1003.388s">But</a> the truth is, the administration does work really hard to say, what do we need and and they actually know, like, they. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1014.271s">They</a> are thoughtful leaders in their own right, and they know what their priorities are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1018.936s">They</a> know what they are seeing is needed and not needed and all of those things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1023.46s">But</a> they also spend a lot of time talking to everybody about what other people think that we need. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1031.248s">Like,</a> every year that we build a budget, the school committee gets asked, like, what are our priorities? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1035.893s">What</a> are the things that we're looking for, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1039.427s">And</a> unfortunately, when you are in a universe where you're just cutting the budget one year after the next, people start to feel bad about asking those questions about, what do you think we need? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1053.351s">Because</a> they're like, I know I'm not going to be able to give you this thing because I know I'm going to have to cut the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1058.953s">So</a> the administration and the finance people, they definitely have a rough job because it's usually their job to say, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1069.088s">I</a> know we want all these things, but we can't have them right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1071.532s">So</a> that's painful for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1074.337s">But</a> they do take a lot of time and care to say what <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1078.514s">is</a> the best way to spend this money? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1079.954s">Where</a> are the prime needs in the district and how do we do that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1084.155s">So,</a> in the background, after talking about these needs, the inclusion specialists in particular, that's a bigger expense, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1092.497s">That's</a> a whole person versus Best Buddies is a stipended position, so a little bit easier to like get off the ground. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1101.519s">When</a> we were talking about these things, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1104.853s">And</a> I was talking to the administration about these being things that I wanted to see. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1109.916s">There</a> was no objection. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1111.057s">There</a> was no disagreement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1112.437s">There</a> was no strong arming that the district would be a better place if we could hire an inclusion specialist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1120.582s">There</a> was no disagreement about that at this time, or frankly, probably ever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1126.586s">But</a> what was different in the right now is we actually had <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1130.768s">Enough</a> money that doing that would not mean not doing something else or saying goodbye to some other professional that we weren't prepared to say goodbye to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1143.601s">So</a> this money gives us a unique opportunity to say, how do we sort of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1149.737s">How</a> do we do this a little bit better and more productively? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1152.818s">And</a> where are those places where we should invest? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1155.199s">And</a> some of them, you know, some of them will look like an inclusion specialist that works with teachers and buildings and with kids, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1163.822s">And</a> others will be sort of invisible to the to the community or to the kids, but really important, like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1172.465s">You</a> know, the example I'd like to give people is, um, our payroll office until recently has run with two payroll specialists. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1182.295s">We</a> have 800 employees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1184.917s">They</a> do like 10 payroll runs and they pay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1192.032s">weekly</a> paychecks, they pay bi-weekly paychecks, they pay teacher schedule paychecks, and then everything under the sun, overtime, all the things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1202.774s">So</a> these poor two people have been trying to like hold the district together and the very first thing you do to have happy employees is you paint them on time, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1214.816s">So</a> for these two folks like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1218.563s">It</a> was, it's impossible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1220.204s">It</a> was impossible for them to ever not be in crisis mode. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1225.149s">So</a> one of the changes, one of the investments that we made that we approved was a third position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1232.351s">Now,</a> students aren't going to see that person, but without that person, we're not supporting teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1239.997s">And</a> when you don't support teachers, you're giving them cause to have to step away from the work that they're there to do to go fight about some question about their paycheck. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1251.407s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1251.627s">And.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1254.429s">When</a> you pay people accurately and reliably and fairly, things get better, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1261.233s">Things</a> improve for everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1263.614s">So</a> that's a position where it's like, yes, it's an administrative position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1267.497s">That</a> person is in our administrative assistance union. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1273.894s">But</a> the work they do is so important to enabling everything that we need to happen so that teachers can focus on kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1281.536s">So</a> there are some things like that that are being proposed and were approved, like some swing shift custodians to support our programming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1293.439s">That</a> does not just happen during the school day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1296.18s">So</a> there's all kinds of things and reasons why this money is going to be put to good use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1303.353s">And</a> we're trying hard to make sure that the vast majority of the money is used in a way that as directly as possible benefits kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1313.582s">We're</a> not looking to spend this hard won money frivolously. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1320.108s">We're</a> not cleaning the bathrooms in gold, and we're not laying down cobblestone walks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1326.754s">We</a> are doing things like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1329.16s">Fixing</a> the elevator at the high school because it's broken. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1332.724s">Like,</a> we're, you know, we're do we're going to fix the flashing at the McGlynn elementary school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1338.47s">Finally.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1340.532s">That</a> causes it to rain inside a 1st floor kindergarten classroom when the rain comes sideways at the building, like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1348.265s">These</a> are really important things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1349.966s">It's</a> going to be amazing for that kindergarten teacher and all her students to be able to go to school after a sideways rainy day and not have a classroom full of buckets and ruined carpets. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1362.171s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1362.531s">Like,</a> but that fix was that's not a. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1365.912s">That's</a> not a minor fix that's like over a 100,000 dollar fix because we have to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1371.374s">Pull</a> the roof off and pull bricks away from the, from the side of the building and fix it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1376.117s">Like,</a> it's, it's not a small change and it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1381.019s">It</a> will mean so much to 1 kindergarten class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1384.58s">But</a> just 1, so those are the kinds of things that when the whole system is constrained. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1390.463s">You,</a> they, they get left. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1393.395s">and</a> people feel neglected and it's not untrue, but it's not for lack of interest in fixing the problems. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1401.343s">But</a> often what the school committee ends up doing is having to make choices. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1407.789s">Like</a> we know what we want, we want all the things, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1411.512s">But</a> we can only have 10 things and we want 15. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1415.576s">Well,</a> we have to then decide <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1418.924s">which</a> are the five we're not going to go forward with. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1421.845s">And</a> I think, you know, when you hear the community come out in support of the things that they're worried about being cut, rightfully so, what you hear about is why that thing is important, but we sort of are a district where there's no obvious like, well, we don't need to do that thing anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1438.748s">Nobody</a> comes with like ideas on the thing that we don't need anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1442.949s">And</a> that's partially because we've been a very bare bones district for a really long time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1447.27s">So,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1449.255s">It</a> changes, you know, sort of the opportunity to do some of the things, like, take care of our buildings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1456.624s">We</a> were able to make some mid year hires like, mid year hires are really hard to do in a school, but there are some places where we felt like we could do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1464.614s">Well,</a> the inclusion specialist is 1 of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1468.859s">And</a> then there are others where we will look at whether there's hiring that has to be done starting with the FY26 budget, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1476.043s">So</a> there's still more to come in terms of the full effect of all of this as we figure out the spending on the remaining bucket of money that has not been earmarked just yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1490.052s">And</a> that amount of money is $3.7 million. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1493.134s">So</a> there's a sizable piece of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1499.612s">spending</a> on the table for this fiscal year that we are still having to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1503.674s">And</a> a lot of that is wrapped up in the changes that we're trying to see come next school year with longer days and fixing the high school schedule and all that good stuff.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1694.721s">No,</a> but I mean, it is a fair point to talk about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1701.558s">Because</a> since the beginning of being on the school committee, it's always been very clear to me that the real need of the district was like $10 to $12 million more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1714.906s">And</a> what we just did was do seven more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1717.167s">So</a> we made a huge dent in that number. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1721.23s">But</a> there will still be, as we go forward, there will still be change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1727.413s">There</a> will still be hard decisions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1731.203s">I</a> just am really hopeful that we're not at the catastrophic level of hard decisions that I feel like we've been at ever since I took office, really, for any variety of reasons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1744.747s">So</a> we still have to do hard work to say, where could we save money? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1751.764s">Um,</a> how could we do something better? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1753.925s">How</a> could we be more efficient? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1755.806s">Like,</a> I think all of those things are so critically important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1759.647s">Because</a> there is not an endless amount of money, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1762.588s">Like,</a> this the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1763.888s">So,</a> we, we moved the, you know, we expanded the pile of money to, so to speak, but it cannot keep expanding that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1774.272s">Without</a> more overrides, and that's not something anybody's particularly interested in doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1780.074s">So,</a> you know, we will again go into a cycle of the district needing to figure out how to self fund the new things they want to do because. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1791.997s">We</a> know that the city's revenue is capped. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1794.918s">At</a> 2 and a half percent a year, plus new growth, so short of, like, explosions and new growth, like, the, the universe of what's possible year to year to year is quite. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1806.524s">Finite,</a> right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1808.045s">So.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1809.046s">You</a> know, I think about some of the things that are happening in the city when they, when, when we're talking about, like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1815.289s">Proposed</a> zoning, which I know is a very hot topic right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1818.171s">1</a> of the things that happens in that discussion is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1825.214s">When</a> we're opposing zoning changes, whatever they might be, that again sort of restricts and confines what the city's growth can be or how quickly it can happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1837.858s">And</a> that's not to say it's entirely the reason you should just say, yes, do anything you want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1842.98s">There</a> need to be rules. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1844.481s">But</a> when we talk about how communities sort of grapple with Proposition 2.5, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1852.423s">Um,</a> if you have land, you build right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1855.926s">Like,</a> if you are in Western mass, like, a developer can go put in a new. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1863.193s">25</a> lot something, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1866.035s">There's</a> not so many spaces around Medford that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1869.658s">Where</a> that is possible, so we're talking about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1872.969s">redeveloping</a> things that are already developed in some fashion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1876.331s">So</a> it is a really different conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1879.532s">Our</a> toolbox is just more limited than some communities that have many more options at their disposal to grow their tax base. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1888.457s">So</a> that's one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1889.957s">The</a> school committee in Arlington has put forward a request to change the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1899.453s">the</a> taxation structure that is available to communities so that when the communities required spending on education, it goes up more than 2.5% that the community has some leverage to be able to like move the tax rates accordingly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1918.368s">That</a> will go to the legislature. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1919.709s">I</a> don't know what will happen or whether they will be successful, but at the end of the day, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1925.208s">If</a> everything is going to cost more money and communities can only. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1930.351s">Collect</a> 2 and a half percent more than they did last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1932.652s">You</a> know, like, this is this sort of a vicious cycle, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1936.775s">And</a> what you see in many communities is that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1939.837s">They,</a> they have an override cycle of, you know, every X years, they, they're doing an override to support what has happened in the community at that time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1951.284s">We've</a> never done this before, so I think we're not in a cycle so much because this was the first time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1959.852s">When</a> you see communities in a cycle, they tend not to be as big. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1963.595s">They</a> tend not to be $7 million big. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1965.477s">They</a> tend to be much smaller. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1967.839s">But</a> you see a different cadence than what has happened in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1971.583s">So</a> I'm hopeful that some of the development discussions will be productive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1976.137s">We'll</a> see some amazing new development, like a Mystic app. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1980.359s">As</a> long as they don't take my yoga studio away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1986.642s">We</a> can use all the tools in our toolkit and not just have to be asking for more money to support basic operations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=1994.306s">But</a> this was a huge step in the right direction.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2004.964s">Um,</a> yeah, so if I was to think about some of the things that are, like, the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2011.047s">The</a> most, um. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2014.79s">Sort</a> of tangible for folks, um. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2017.711s">There's</a> a number of teachers that we were able to fund and pay for where. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2025.425s">The</a> district had to hire the teachers so that our class sizes did not explode based on last minute enrollment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2031.69s">So</a> we're able to pay for those and not have to cut something else between now and the end of the year to sort of balance the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2037.074s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2039.232s">and</a> that includes a district wide music teacher. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2042.074s">Um,</a> we also, um, we'll be adding another administrative assistant, um, to the McGlynn complex. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2049.801s">That's</a> very visible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2050.861s">Um,</a> we'll have a nurse that can sort of float and cover, um, the nurses across the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2058.067s">Um,</a> we will be doing some changes, some changes to security around, um, how staff enter and, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2068.052s">have</a> access to buildings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2069.032s">So</a> instead of having actual keys, we will be moving on into the modern day around, you know, access and security and knowing who's in the building and all that good stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2079.336s">Um,</a> we've got a whole bunch of, um, maintenance things that are on the list. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2085.598s">Um,</a> we'll be replacing $12,000 worth of instruments, um, across Medford public schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2090.54s">That's</a> a big deal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2091.3s">Um,</a> we also, um, let's see, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2098.276s">And</a> then we will be like, really preparing for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2103.722s">This</a> shift in the schedule that we're working through with our bargaining partners and that that will be a big deal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2110.067s">There's</a> a ton of work to do to make that happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2112.829s">But.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2113.609s">Increasing</a> the amount of education we're able to provide to students is huge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2118.573s">And</a> that's to be able to create more access for, like, electives for the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2123.537s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2124.458s">So</a> 1 of the, it will change the schedule substantially at the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2128.2s">So</a> that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2130.522s">Our</a> vocational students have more access to things that they just can't access today, like the arts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2137.324s">My</a> daughter is at the in the robotics program, and she takes Spanish online, which is like a really terrible way to learn the language. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2146.285s">And,</a> you know, there's things like that where the schedule and and the other big thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2151.266s">To</a> Trisha's point is that some of the support that our students need academically is really, really hard to accomplish in the current schedule, particularly if they're at the book. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2166.729s">So</a> we should be able to open up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2169.23s">More</a> academic support for students who may be struggling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2172.991s">And</a> so that will be a very big deal as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2175.252s">So</a> there's lots to come this, you know, we're, we're hard at work doing what we can to get ready and working with the teachers to negotiate all the changes to the contract that will have to happen in order to enable all of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2190.177s">But.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2191.101s">There's,</a> there's a lot, there's a lot to do.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2295.103s">to</a> things it's always words it's always words you know yeah it means a lot when you start stepping up it does people notice and they're like okay well you know yeah it's it's really interesting i you know my kids are in eighth grade and 10th grade now and the district is it really is a very different place than it was you know when lila was in kindergarten um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2322.085s">There's</a> a reading curriculum in elementary schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2326.147s">There's</a> a science curriculum in the elementary schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2328.809s">There's</a> a math curriculum in the elementary schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2331.751s">There's</a> new textbooks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2333.192s">We</a> use computers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2334.553s">There</a> has been so much change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2339.776s">If</a> you get to sit back and reflect, we really are a district that is in transition and is moving forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2349.141s">But</a> it's very easy to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2352.044s">get</a> stuck in what we're not doing yet or what we can't do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2358.646s">And</a> I feel like that's sort of where we've always been, and we're trying to break out of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2362.767s">So</a> it's a work in progress, but I think we're moving in the right direction at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2368.849s">So</a> my kids have had a good experience here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2375.348s">Lila's</a> in the vocational school, so I look forward to making some changes that make the schedule better for not just her, but for all the half of our students that are involved in vocational education at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2388.137s">It's</a> not a minority of students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2392.44s">It's</a> not what your vocational school used to look like when we went to school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2399.245s">It's</a> a really different place, and there's just so much opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2402.827s">for</a> the kids that go through the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ySXafCjZWJIRSmslpa4DU?t=2404.668s">So</a> bringing that opportunity to more kids is sort of the name of the game for me and making sure that all kids are feeling like they have that opportunity and that it's not like a one size fits all picture of like what opportunity needs or looks like.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=375.807s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=377.729s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=379.217s">We</a> are done with the MSBA Module 1 work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=388.239s">On</a> Wednesday, the board of the MSBA will hear a recommendation from their staff to move us on to what they call Phase 2 or Module 2, which is where we get to start doing the fun things like bringing on the professionals that will help us through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=407.847s">And</a> we're really excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=409.589s">So,</a> um, that meeting will happen, um, Wednesday morning, and then, um, there will be meetings to onboard us to MSBA's expectations of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=419.897s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=421.858s">Shortly</a> thereafter, um, our delegation has sent the MSBA a letter of support on our behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=429.604s">So</a> that was signed by, um, Senator Jalen, representatives Donato, Barbara, and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=438.146s">Garbalee,</a> so the MSBA is in receipt of that letter of recommendation and we're just really excited to be able to do this next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=448.09s">We're</a> so excited, in fact, that we have already started doing the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=452.332s">So</a> one of the meetings that we had earlier this month was of the OPM selection committee who tackled building <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=463.695s">the</a> request for services, which is the very first document in the next phase of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=469.82s">We</a> will review that tonight with a goal to make any amendments that this committee sees fit and get ready to send that to the MSBA tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=482.01s">And</a> we're going to send that to them tomorrow so that we can be in the queue for their review, which takes about two weeks, and then we can move forward on an aggressive timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=492.456s">which</a> will, um, have us, um, interviewing and bringing in, um, uh, an owner's project manager here before the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=502.858s">So,</a> um, it's a, it's a quick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=505.279s">It's</a> a quick tight timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=506.619s">I</a> wish it could be even faster than that because getting the team on board is incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=511.78s">And</a> that's, you know, that's when the real work can begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=514.561s">So,</a> um, the educators have sort of done their work, um, so far with setting the stage around what kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=522.291s">educational</a> opportunities we're trying to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=524.433s">And</a> now we get to the sort of meaty questions that everyone in the community has, which is really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=533.163s">So</a> that's a quick update on phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=536.646s">Are</a> there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=552.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=552.747s">If</a> you think of anything, just, um, let me know and we will, um, we will move on from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=558.832s">So</a> in phase two, our next agenda item is, um, is, uh, our plans for phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=566.758s">Um,</a> I covered some of that already, but the, the goal is for us to be, um, moving quickly through this process so that we can onboard the team and really get, um, to the meat of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=579.287s">Um,</a> Oh, Emily, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=611.725s">Yeah,</a> they that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=613.826s">So</a> they, they did a study that looked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=616.746s">I</a> want to say it was about 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=619.987s">And</a> 1 of the things that we went back and forth with them about was exactly that that range. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=625.968s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=626.248s">Our</a> enrollment projections within MPS show that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=633.152s">mostly</a> in agreement in the first 10 to 15 years of the building's life or from now but that you know as we looked out past 15 years that's where we saw the growth that was more significant so that was part of the conversation that we had particularly around some of the housing developments that are coming down the pike and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=659.83s">Not</a> just like the planned projects and the permitted projects, which they ask about explicitly, but also some of the bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=667.192s">Ideas</a> and places where we are anticipating there could be substantial transformative projects in the city, like the air rights over Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=678.776s">So</a> those are the kinds of things that we had to go through with them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=686.023s">sort</a> of describe and look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=687.524s">And</a> so we shared our projections with them and our projections sort of carry us much further into time than that original 15 year span. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=697.79s">So</a> we did make some significant progress there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=700.392s">So</a> I do believe that based on everything that we were able to use as the basis, we will not be out of space the minute we start or even, you know, in the first couple of decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=716.263s">which</a> is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=716.987s">Any</a> other questions about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=725.294s">Okay,</a> so in phase two, there's a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=731.198s">So</a> I've been doing a lot of reading and the OPM selection committee has been doing a lot of reading as well about what phase two entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=739.403s">And</a> it entails, you know, bringing on the owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=744.287s">MSBA</a> has a very prescriptive process for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=746.248s">So</a> I've been reading about that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=749.07s">The</a> very first step is that we have to draft an RFS. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=751.972s">We'll</a> look at that in just a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=753.893s">And</a> then they will have to review that it takes them a couple of weeks to review it and then they'll give us the green light to go ahead and post it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=762.816s">It</a> has to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=764.116s">We</a> have to do a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=766.797s">We</a> will get responses back and. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=771.167s">And</a> then, you know, bring the list down to a short list, interview candidates, and make a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=777.333s">Once</a> we make a selection, we negotiate the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=783.159s">At</a> that point, that's not part of the RFS process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=786.242s">It</a> happens afterwards, which was a surprise to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=789.826s">That's</a> most of the RFPs that I work on in my world. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=792.528s">They're</a> sort of two things happen at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=795.911s">But</a> this process is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=798.272s">And</a> once we have made our selection and we have done those negotiations, we then have to bring our selected OPM to a review panel with MSBA and they have to give us the green light for that selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=812.898s">So</a> there is a, those review panel meetings happen on a monthly basis and we are targeting the June meeting to be <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=823.209s">all</a> buttoned up and ready to go to get their approval so we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=829.532s">Once</a> the OPM is on board, then we work to bring on the designer, which is the architect, so that we can get ready to start the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=838.837s">So</a> that's sort of the trajectory of this next phase is OPM, designer, and then we actually get to the fun stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=848.307s">but</a> I'm looking forward to having the OPM on board because they will help manage some of the things that we are doing here as a committee, some of the outreach and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=857.531s">So,</a> um, we will, we will look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=861.893s">Any</a> questions about phase two process? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=873.717s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=875.158s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=877.478s">I</a> am going to share my screen if I am allowed to do that Dr. Cushing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=887.355s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=890.171s">And</a> I am going to bring up this RFS template. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=893.993s">I</a> think a couple of things to know about this template is you must use this template. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=899.916s">This</a> is part of the process and the requirement from MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=904.818s">And</a> they've done a pretty nice job of being able to describe what it is that they're asking for communities to provide input to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=923.913s">a</a> little bit hard to look at this document because it is in track change mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=927.937s">So</a> if that makes you a little bit crazy, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=934.623s">That</a> is also a requirement of MSBA so that they can quickly and easily find the changes that we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=940.97s">Here</a> is our RFS, there's a whole bunch of lead-in information here, and then we get to the actual meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=948.555s">So,</a> as you can see, everything that is in bold and in italics, that's where they're asking us to provide input, and everything that's struck out and filled in with comments and track changes that were the result of the work that the OPM Selection Subcommittee did. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=970.17s">So</a> this introduction is obviously very boilerplate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=974.432s">We're</a> saying, this is Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=976.133s">This</a> is Medford high school, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=979.535s">So</a> those changes have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=981.176s">And</a> then there is the other thing that we are asked to talk about here in this introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=988.419s">Oops,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=991.64s">Um,</a> are sort of what we think the total cost of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=996.586s">Could</a> be, and this is an estimate, and it's, I think, an effort to give an understanding of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1004.777s">How</a> big do we think the scope of this could be and so the. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1010.473s">OPM</a> selection committee identified 200 million to 600 million as a very wide range. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1017.877s">It's</a> a wide range because there's a lot of unknown right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1021.618s">It's</a> also a very wide range because any number of solutions could be viable for us and we don't know yet which of those solutions <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1032.027s">from</a> building something completely new to substantially renovating what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1037.768s">We</a> don't yet know how that will shake out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1040.548s">And</a> that's what the feasibility study is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1042.589s">So</a> this is what we came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1045.649s">And</a> to me, it's just a signal for those folks who are watching that we understand that there could be any number of solutions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1055.151s">And</a> we are wanting and interested in exploring them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1062.585s">The</a> background is the next section and I will leave this up just for you to read it and I will happily read it out loud to provide a little bit of information about the background of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1077.489s">The</a> city of Medford located in the greater Boston area is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1084.334s">The</a> district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1093.341s">The</a> Medford High School, established in the mid-20th century, has served as a cornerstone of the city community's financial infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1099.347s">However,</a> over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators, or the broader community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1107.035s">The</a> facility's aging systems, limited space, and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to the high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1117.156s">The</a> Medford Comprehensive School Building Committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives, and community members with a variety of backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1128.588s">The</a> committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the Medford High School project, ensuring that it meets academic, social, and safety needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1137.577s">The</a> committee has brought support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis-Tufts program to increase access to student activities for students at the Curtis-Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1152.425s">The</a> district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle schools 6-8, and the high school 9-12. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1160.529s">The</a> existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1165.712s">The</a> Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, fine and performing arts spaces and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1174.258s">The</a> district is also pursuing consolidation of our early childhood programming into a single location to alleviate space concerns that are for elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1181.964s">As</a> part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the member of public schools submitted a statement of interest to the highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building shortcomings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1193.067s">The</a> accepted serves as a reference for the current project and outlines the key areas of concern, such as structural integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1200.789s">accessibility,</a> energy efficiency, and technology integration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1204.111s">The</a> project aim is to not only enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1212.316s">This</a> request for services seeks to engage a qualified owners project manager who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise in design, construction, and project management. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1223.102s">The</a> goal is to create a state-of-the-art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration, and academic excellence, and do the project

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1257.806s">Okay,</a> we'll move on the project description objectives and scope of service have some sort of small things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1269.067s">that</a> we had to fill in, and then we were asked to provide some specific information regarding the identified school, including but not limited to total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building, and or site, if any, building conditions and problems, current grade structure, enrollment, and MSBA agreed upon enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1289.927s">So</a> in this section, we've added some information to answer that request, which says the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1304.288s">From</a> its opening in <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1306.979s">Until</a> 2017, it housed 2 distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1312.204s">In</a> 2017, the Medford School Committee voted to merge the 2 schools into 1 comprehensive high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1317.348s">But</a> despite the forward-looking vision aimed at establishing 1 flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the Medford community, the facility is designed for delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1329.499s">The</a> challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated with increasing severity by infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1338.501s">MPS</a> envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programs and a host of vocational programs sanctioned under Chapter 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1347.644s">The</a> 55-year-old aging facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1352.885s">Medford</a> High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 to 12. we also support students in project transition aged 18 to 22 over 50% of our high school students are CTE students. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1365.262s">Additionally,</a> the Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1370.417s">A</a> pre-K program that includes 100 students and a daycare for children's ages two months to five years has an enrollment of 74 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1379.142s">Together,</a> the total enrollment of students at MHS is 84. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1385.465s">So</a> we should fix that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1387.326s">I</a> will fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1393.089s">The</a> district's agreed upon enrollment for the projection for a new Medford High School is <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1399.613s">1695</a> of this figure, 1395 are 9 to 12 high school students, 200 are pre-k students, and 100 are students in the district state care program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1410.041s">Questions</a> about that section? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1411.442s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1425.297s">Project</a> objectives under consideration by the owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1428.978s">So</a> this, this section actually was a place where we had a lot of discussion in our subcommittee meeting around, like, what are the things that we want to call out? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1440.122s">We,</a> so we've made this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1442.683s">I</a> also, in my work to sort of tighten up a few things, did take a peek at a couple of other RFSs from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1450.325s">So</a> this list is very much open for, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1454.804s">Suggestion</a> and questions, if we, if there's anything else we want to add that helps people understand sort of what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1463.728s">So</a> we talk about the Northeast collaborative for high performance schools and or the US Green Building Council's lead for schools rating system qualification and analysis of potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1474.507s">To</a> be a net zero energy building life cycle costs of operational of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1483.273s">We</a> are interested in a CM at risk delivery method. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1486.095s">Potentially</a> we have identified potential other sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1491.259s">So</a> there's a vetting process that our is going to need to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1496.298s">Um,</a> site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if a new if a new project remains in the current place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1503.101s">So,</a> as, you know, there's 1 way in and 1 way out of Medford high and that is a significant sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1510.664s">Bottleneck</a> as we flow people in and out of the building, so we would want to be looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1517.578s">update</a> the serving existing condition information of buildings on the Medford High site, including any hazardous materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1524.403s">So</a> there's any number of things that could happen on the campus that they have to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1530.747s">Provide</a> design alternatives for renovation, addition, renovation, and new construction options for the high school to meet the educational specification of the school building committee and the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1541.415s">provide</a> a schedule, construction cost estimate, operating cost estimate, and life cycle sustainability analysis for each option. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1549.742s">Constraints</a> of the district, it's assumed that school will be in session on this site for the duration of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1555.827s">So</a> phase construction and possible use of swing space may be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1559.851s">And</a> then under that bullet, I think the other things that we've talked a lot about is like we will have some extra work to do from a planning perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1569.098s">To</a> ensure learning continuity for all students, but particularly for our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1576.089s">We</a> may need to purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1581.015s">Modular</a> something to support this project, depending on what happens and we know that that's a thing that we might need to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1588.343s">We</a> might need to provide and maintain a, you know, we will need to provide and maintain a secure and positive educational environment during construction and then also sort of seeking somebody that has some experience with phase construction projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1602.057s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1604.255s">That</a> is sort of the list of things that the OPM Selection Committee came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1611.098s">If</a> there are any other thoughts or suggestions here, I'm happy to take them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1646.047s">W-E-L-L,</a> Marista? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1647.649s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1648.209s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1648.469s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1649.05s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1649.55s">I</a> added that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1659.938s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1670.556s">Updating</a> evaluation of CM at risk delivery method, including a final recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1676.56s">Thank</a> you, Philip. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1677.26s">That's</a> great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1705.752s">Thank</a> you, Libby.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1737.106s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1742.307s">Any</a> other questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1767.002s">Okay,</a> so the next section that requires our attention is the evaluation criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1778.827s">So,</a> in this section, we had a lot of discussion about this as well and you can see that a lot of this does come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1790.745s">you</a> know, come from MSBA's template. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1793.487s">The</a> text in green was added. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1796.489s">The</a> other thing that we talked a lot about was the point scale, and this will be used by the OPM Selection Committee to rate and evaluate all the bids that we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1808.997s">And</a> sort of the calculus of how we put this together was to award <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1817.382s">Um,</a> standard sort of thresholds of points for different things that range from, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1823.523s">We</a> need to have this, but it's very likely everyone's going to have this skill to, um, the, the more customized things at higher number of points. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1832.065s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1833.166s">Um,</a> if you look at this, what you'll see is some 10 point option, some 10 point items to me, those are things that feel very, uh, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1843.708s">You</a> know, sort of table stake key, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1845.51s">Like</a> an, who is doing this work all the time is more than likely going to have those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1852.515s">The</a> 20 point scale sort of steps up a little bit where now there is some variability and. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1859.401s">Discretion</a> in terms of how those things might get delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1862.183s">30</a> points does talk a little bit more about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1870.51s">You</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1871.7s">their</a> overall capacity to do these kinds of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1875.643s">And</a> then, you know, sort of some bigger point values around key personnel who will work with us at 40 points, as well as 50 points for past performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1891.435s">And</a> I stole this from Arlington, which you can see, so I'll fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1896.158s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1896.318s">Medford.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1896.678s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1901.147s">The</a> selection committee felt like this sort of point allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1905.648s">Worked,</a> but I would be very curious if there's anyone in the room who has other thoughts or suggestions about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1912.55s">About</a> that, because now is the time to sort of set that methodology in place.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1934.638s">So</a> what we have learned through this process so far is that there is no cost response that comes with bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1944.804s">So</a> this is a process where we evaluate, it's a value-based contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1953.589s">And</a> once you select somebody, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1956.091s">Then</a> you move into a phase where you negotiate with them and you talk about price. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1960.795s">Having</a> said that part of the documents that will be delivered with this are all of the public exhibits with MSPA and it's well on record that we have a certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1974.785s">amount</a> of money set aside for the feasibility study, which we had to break down to say this much is for the OPM, this much is for the designer, and this much is for incidental. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=1985.049s">So</a> all of that will be well known to people in terms of what our scope and budget is, but my understanding is that all of that price conversation comes after you make your selection first, which is a little bit unusual, but that's how this process works.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2041.677s">There</a> are a handful of, yeah, you, you didn't miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2044.518s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2045.658s">There</a> are a handful of other attachments that need to come together with this that are provided by MSBA that are not here right now, but they, we will have to provide those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2072.262s">Any</a> other questions about the evaluation points and methodology? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2076.684s">I</a> know it's a lot of, like, meat to take in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2086.269s">The</a> next section does talk about a shortlist, and Philip, to your question about cost, this is where I thought that the cost conversation would happen is once you get to the shortlist and you're evaluating the <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2099.945s">proposals,</a> and even then, that's not what happens in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2103.728s">So</a> basically, once we get down to the short list of candidates and we invite them in for finalist interviews, the scale there is the quality of the reference checks for 30 points and 70 points for the quality of the finalist presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2120.681s">And</a> then you have to make a selection before you get into that cost discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2125.485s">So</a> that has been edited and updated based on some of the work the team <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2129.898s">Has</a> done since our meeting to get clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2141.363s">Much</a> of this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2144.442s">Boilerplate</a> and the next the next component of the of what is here is the list of who who is on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2158.256s">So</a> we have to name those folks and talk a little bit about some of the details of what we plan to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2167.182s">In</a> terms of how the shortlist will be done, so we're planning for 2 hour interviews and then how how we will actually negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2177.83s">The,</a> the price, and so I actually did steal from Arlington from Arlington's in terms of how we will do this, but essentially the chair of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2191.376s">Uh,</a> review committee, the CFO of NPS, the superintendent and the budget director work together to negotiate a fee, um, with the 1st ranked, um, respondent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2200.442s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2201.843s">Um,</a> all the rest of this came from Arlington, um, their RFS went through the same process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2208.027s">So</a> I, um, I felt good about sort of pulling all of that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2213.631s">Um,</a> and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2219.502s">Then</a> the next thing that is outlined here is a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2225.684s">So</a> this timeline does assume that it will take the MSBA two weeks from Wednesday, essentially, to do their review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2235.766s">And</a> it takes us about a week to get things posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2239.99s">uh,</a> from a procurement perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2241.671s">So</a> I've given us a week of buffer, um, and then, uh, have sort of cascaded from there through, um, the series of activities and tried to plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2251.836s">Um,</a> you'll see, there's like sort of a gap right in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2255.198s">And,</a> um, that gap is, um, certainly, um, due to April vacation, um, knowing that that is a really hard time for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2263.903s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2265.472s">I</a> felt okay about that, especially because the OPM review panel meeting that we would be eligible to attend is not until 6-2, so we had plenty of time to navigate that April vacation timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2281.116s">Questions</a> about the timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2299.06s">Okay,</a> just about everything else is sort of filling in the name of our procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2307.485s">And,</a> oh, sorry, Phil, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2315.61s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2323.974s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2351.792s">There</a> was a question as well about certifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2355.654s">So</a> there was a in here it's asked if we asked us to say what certifications we require. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2361.716s">And</a> I did a little bit of sleuthing and did talk to our legal counsel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2368.539s">And</a> this is very similar to what Arlington articulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2374.201s">So</a> I don't think there's anything <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2376.768s">Um,</a> particularly specific here that we need to require, um, instead to ask them what their certifications are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2384.674s">Um,</a> so I would actually, if anybody who is more in this world than I am has any suggestions, if there's anything specific there, I'm happy to take those suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2410.24s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2412.821s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2413.741s">I</a> think that is just about everything that was changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2417.342s">Oh,</a> Paul?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2426.906s">It's</a> very hard to, I love track changes, but at some point it gets to be like too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2435.149s">So</a> we'll clean up the formatting and everything once the MSBA weighs in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2442.545s">And,</a> you know, we will provide people our statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2446.647s">We</a> will provide them our educational profile and our Chapter 74 forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2450.429s">All</a> of those things will go with the package in addition to the forms that and contracts that MSBA requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2461.135s">So</a> all of that will go with this package when it goes out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2468.796s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2469.756s">Are</a> there any other questions about this document? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2484.663s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2486.544s">So</a> my goal would be for us to take a vote to approve this as amended so that it can go to the MSBA tomorrow and be in queue for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2499.477s">one</a> day before they move us into the next phase so that we're in line and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2506.462s">Is</a> there a motion to do so? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2508.543s">Emily?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2512.086s">OK,</a> motion to approve by Emily, seconded by?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2576.597s">Luke</a> Prisner absent, uh, Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2579.302s">Yes,</a> so 14 in the affirmative, 1, 0 in the negative, 1 absent, uh, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2585.754s">So</a> I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2588.277s">get</a> this in the queue so that we can move, which is so exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2593.239s">The</a> last thing on our list, as we were working through, as the OPM Selection Subcommittee was working through the creation of this document, we did have some discussion around the size of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2610.348s">So</a> right now, there are three voting members on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2614.35s">It's</a> myself, Dr. Cushing, and Aaron. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2617.592s">We</a> have 2 non-voting members on the committee, Fiona Maxwell, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, and John McLaughlin, who was not able to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2628.84s">But</a> we did talk a bit about whether it made sense for there to be 1 or 2 additional folks on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2637.667s">probably</a> two so that we can keep an odd number just so that the group that is sort of vetting all of this gets just a little bit bigger than it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2649.653s">Um,</a> and I think the vision is that this group would be the group that sort of sits through all of the reviews, um, and, um, certainly, um, does all of the evaluation to bring a recommendation back to this committee before it's all said and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2665.837s">But,</a> um. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2667.657s">That's</a> I think it will be a significant amount of work and I am particularly interested in making sure that, um, some of the folks that we put on this committee to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2681.183s">Advise</a> in this process might be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2686.405s">you</a> know, might be good additions to this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2688.586s">So,</a> um, the, the recommendation from, um, the subcommittee was that we add two voting members and maybe one non-voting member to the, to the group, um, to make sure that we have enough eyes on this really important decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2705.313s">Um,</a> so I bring that back to this group because this group voted on that committee initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2711.816s">So</a> we also would, um, need to vote to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2716.628s">make</a> a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2719.549s">So</a> I will open that up if there's any questions or comments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2744.299s">I</a> think that will depend on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2747.44s">So</a> I think whoever is on the committee, what we will have to do between now and the time this is published is make sure that there is availability and we can block those times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2758.024s">But</a> I think there is some flexibility on that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2764.586s">And</a> I'm sure it's not uncommon for these kinds of things to happen, not inside the working day. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2770.963s">So,</a> I think we have some flexibility there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2773.425s">I</a> just, you know, the timeline will will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2776.908s">Fast</a> and pretty tight, even if we are doing it after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2794.605s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2837.524s">So,</a> so there's a motion to add Libby Brown to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2845.189s">Second</a> seconded by Marissa there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2851.969s">Any</a> questions or comments about that motion from the rest of the group?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2886.957s">Well,</a> then I will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2890.658s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2893.798s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2894.959s">Dr.</a> Galusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2896.499s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2897.619s">Dr.</a> Cushing.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2979.717s">Okay,</a> nomination for Member Ruseau by Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2983.02s">Is</a> there a second?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3085.725s">Are</a> there other folks who might want to give Dr. Galusi some free time and join us instead?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3116.201s">I</a> did have a couple of email exchanges with Luke. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3119.483s">And</a> what he was referring to was sort of the creation of the document and willingness to help support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3127.706s">So</a> I didn't read it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3129.847s">And</a> I know he was unable to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3131.567s">So</a> I would hate to put him on the spot like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3138.85s">And</a> he did see the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3140.411s">So</a> if he had an inkling of that, I'm sure that he would have let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3145.334s">And</a> I do expect that he will be very active on the communications and community engagement subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3150.521s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3150.781s">I</a> didn't know we have a couple of other architects in our midst. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3156.188s">Is</a> that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3159.51s">I</a> want to put you on the spot, Brian.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3187.175s">Well,</a> I think to your point, this is the first procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3192.298s">This</a> is the OPM selection committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3194.48s">There</a> will be another whole procurement to bring on the designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3198.303s">And</a> so maybe we ask Dr. Galusi to be part of this process, and we plan to shift that selection committee to give people a break and pull you in at that time when we are onboarding that designer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3250.303s">Well,</a> we'll hire you in just a few weeks, hopefully, for that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3255.585s">So</a> is there an official nomination to add Dr. Galusi to the OPM selection committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=3262.727s">OK,</a> so nominated by Dr. Cushing.

<a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=89.748s">Sorry,</a> Jenny, I am here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=91.549s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=91.969s">Thank</a> you, Fiona. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=95.631s">Peter</a> Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=96.872s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=97.993s">John</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=103.016s">John</a> is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=104.377s">And</a> Bob Dickinson? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=110.14s">See</a> Bob as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=111.201s">So</a> three voting members present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=116.184s">We</a> have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=119.459s">So,</a> what I was hoping to do tonight was a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=123.603s">So,</a> 1st, provide some updates and talk a little bit about this next phase of the project for for and then actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=129.729s">Look</a> at. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=135.534s">a</a> drafted deliverable that we'll need to complete for the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=138.816s">I'll</a> talk about that in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=140.317s">Then</a> implicit in all of that will be to discuss our vetting and selection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=150.503s">My</a> hope for tonight is that we can come out of it with an RFS that is pretty well complete and ready to be vetted and viewed by MSBA, which is one of the steps in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=163.07s">But</a> between now and then we have a couple of things to look at in the RFS. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=167.893s">So</a> we'll get to that in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=171.175s">In</a> terms of sort of what happens in this next module, there's two components, two big components of module 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=178.779s">One</a> is to hire the OPM and the other is to hire the designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=182.281s">So</a> we're not going to worry about the designer just yet because we have to hire an OPM before that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=186.984s">I</a> believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=190.116s">We</a> will be recommended for approval at the board meeting coming up on the 26th of February and that will be our invitation to the next phase of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=205.226s">So</a> this is module 2 of MSBA, which is where we hire our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=209.869s">That's</a> actually going to help do the lion's share of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=212.191s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=213.071s">I'm</a> excited for the next phase because I think our work gets easier when we have the professionals on board who do this for a living instead of all of us having to figure out and learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=223.562s">all</a> the moving parts of the MSBA process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=225.864s">So</a> once that happens, we will have to do a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=233.348s">So</a> we will have to identify an OPM selection committee, which we actually have already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=240.292s">It</a> is this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=242.293s">We</a> identified and voted on this back in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=247.322s">As</a> I think about the work ahead, and we can maybe come back to this at the end, but as of right now, we have three voting members on this committee, myself, Aaron, and Dr. Cushing, and we will make the selection of the OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=263.752s">So</a> that's actually, in my mind, quite a small group of people to pick what becomes a really central figure in our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=273.497s">We</a> may want to think about at our next full committee meeting, adding some number of voting members to this committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=282.501s">So,</a> thank you for joining. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=283.601s">And</a> certainly, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=288.903s">The</a> more the merrier is probably not the right thought process to make this happen, but I do think we should welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=298.973s">Some</a> perspectives outside of school administration and elected officials to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=304.959s">So</a> we have to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=307.742s">We</a> can come back to that at the end once we have once I can give you a little bit more information about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=313.471s">Um,</a> what this process is and what the and more and I think as importantly, what the timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=318.614s">So,</a> um, once we get sort of flagged through to this next phase, we will have to do a couple of things to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=326.779s">We</a> have to designate our procurement admin. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=330.922s">Um,</a> that's Fiona. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=331.962s">So</a> we know who that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=333.083s">We</a> just have to officially put that in writing and move along. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=337.522s">We</a> have to let them know who our selection committee is, which we will be able to do pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=346.687s">And</a> then we will have to give them a draft of what they call RFS, request for services, that shows our redlined version of their template. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=357.051s">So</a> MSBA does require that we use their template. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=360.312s">It's</a> quite prescriptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=362.713s">It</a> made it actually quite easy to fill out, which was wonderful as I was working on this with Will from our communications team. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=373.297s">So</a> we will have to <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=377.372s">seek</a> their approval on how we have filled out this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=382.133s">The</a> document includes any number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=385.194s">Once</a> they approve, we will then have to advertise this in three places. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=391.776s">We</a> will have to advertise it in what the MSBA calls the central register. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=397.457s">We'll</a> have to advertise this in a newspaper, and we'll have to advertise this on Combis is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=406.548s">Generally,</a> they do recommend that we hold an onsite meeting for interested bidders. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=412.494s">We</a> will then have to go through a process, which we do have to lay out in the RFS where we. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=418.04s">Score</a> all of our. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=423.474s">All</a> of the bid submissions that we receive, we will then down select to a shortlist service set and invite those folks into visit with us live. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=435.338s">We</a> will then. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=437.539s">Call</a> references, make a selection and bring that selection to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=444.727s">the</a> OPM review panel that is hosted by the MSBA on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=449.531s">Once</a> they agree with our selection through that process, then we're free to move into executing a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=458.42s">So</a> that's like the process in a teeny tiny nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=463.084s">I'll</a> stop there and find out if there are any questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=480.367s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=480.827s">And</a> Fiona, I think I did have one question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=485.588s">It</a> talked about advertising in the Central Register, the newspaper, and Combis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=491.17s">Am</a> I correct in assuming that your office will be able to handle that upon issue?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=500.052s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=500.673s">OK,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=503.903s">So</a> really, having said all of that, this team will have its work cut out for us as we look at the bid submissions and pick our partner in all of this as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=522.377s">So</a> I'm going to share my screen and walk through the RFS with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=527.159s">I'm</a> happy to share a copy of this once we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=529.44s">I</a> meant to share it before now, but I was still working on it like five minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=537.023s">But</a> I think overall, what we need to make sure that we're doing is giving bidders an opportunity to know sort of what we're looking for and what we're seeking, as well as sort of staying compliant with <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=552.781s">what</a> the MSBA is asking us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=554.662s">So</a> let me pull that up real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=559.746s">I'm</a> going to apologize in advance because it's a little, little wacky with all of the red lines, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=585.07s">Can</a> everybody see my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=587.553s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=588.414s">Okay,</a> so this is the template that the provides and the 1st piece is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=597.203s">Instructions,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=598.504s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=600.75s">We</a> have to follow the instructions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=603.192s">We</a> have to review this RFS and make sure that all of our owner specific information is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=612.561s">We</a> need to review this RFS with our legal counsel to ensure it's in compliance with our federal, state and local laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=622.28s">for</a> the school committee, that's Howard Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=624.322s">He</a> is our school committee attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=627.884s">So</a> unless, Fiona, there is somebody else that typically isn't involved from a procurement perspective, my thought would be to pass this by Howard to make sure that he is on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=638.212s">Do</a> you agree with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=639.012s">100%,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=639.973s">He</a> is, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=641.474s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=643.676s">So</a> we'll have to submit this red line version for MSBA's review prior to advertisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=649.74s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=651.983s">We</a> will also include a series of attachments, which I'll talk about later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=658.426s">We'll</a> have to, a copy of the final RFS and advertisement needs to be submitted to the MSBA with a sample narrative summary and checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=669.892s">So</a> we'll have to get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=672.353s">An</a> owner should allow a minimum of 10 business days for the MSBA to review the RFS and <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=680.244s">we</a> should not be advertising until MSBA approves. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=683.686s">So</a> those are our sort of rules and requirements here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=687.968s">So</a> as we move forward here, essentially in this template, everything that's in bold and italics are places where the MSBA is telling us this is for you to fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=699.534s">So</a> this first section is pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=707.578s">in</a> terms of just replacing our name and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=715.043s">This</a> part right here, it does talk about potential approved project may include a renovation of an existing school, a renovation of an addition of an existing school and or new construction, which is why these total project costs have a big range. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=734.675s">This</a> is a range that <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=736.696s">I</a> looked at based on what I see in the marketplace, because if we are going to pursue some sort of renovation, it might be much smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=743.62s">If</a> we're pursuing a completely new build, it would be much bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=746.441s">And</a> it's all dependent on the solution that we all agree to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=752.144s">Questions</a> about that so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=753.345s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=759.398s">Then</a> it asks for a background. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=762.541s">So</a> this did right with the help of my technological friends over at CHAP-GPT, who have the benefit of all of our documents posted to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=779.176s">But</a> essentially what they are asking for here is some <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=783.231s">Some</a> background information about the city, the school building committee, our grade configuration, just things that are pertinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=795.381s">So</a> I will read what I've written. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=797.583s">I</a> take no offense if you think it's terrible, but we can wordsmith it as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=804.048s">The</a> city of Medford, located in the greater Boston area, is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=811.879s">The</a> district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=819.409s">The</a> Medford High School, established in the mid-20th century, has served as a cornerstone of the community's educational infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=826.591s">However,</a> over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators, or the broader community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=833.714s">The</a> facility's aging systems, limited space, and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to the high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=844.186s">The</a> Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives, and community members with a variety of backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=855.549s">The</a> committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the Medford High School project, ensuring that it meets academic, social, and safety needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=864.475s">The</a> committee has broad support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis Tufts program to increase access to programming for students of this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=883.491s">I</a> used program a lot in that sentence, so I will fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=888.272s">The</a> district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle school 6-8, and the high school grades 9-12. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=893.993s">The</a> existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=900.315s">The</a> Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, art spaces, and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=908.337s">As</a> part of the ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the Medford Public Schools submitted <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=913.958s">A</a> statement of interest to the MSBA highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building's shortcomings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=922.105s">The</a> accepted SOI serves as a reference for the project and outlines key areas of concern such as structural integrity, accessibility, energy efficiency, and technology integration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=931.012s">The</a> project aims not only to enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=937.777s">This</a> request for services seeks to engage qualified professionals who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise in design, construction, and project management. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=947.404s">The</a> goal is to create a state-of-the-art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration, and academic excellence, and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large, and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn, and thrive in the new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=969.257s">Um,</a> that's questions things that are missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=975.902s">I</a> know that was a lot.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1029.728s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1031.03s">Arts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1032.432s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1033.153s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1086.325s">Any</a> other questions thoughts about that lead in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1089.849s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1093.053s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1094.534s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1098.16s">This</a> section is pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1101.803s">The</a> next thing that we have to provide is to provide specific information regarding the identified school, including, but not limited to the total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building and or site, if any building conditions and problems, grade structure and enrollment and MSBA agreed upon enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1123.041s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1125.353s">We</a> have a starting point here that says the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1134.764s">From</a> its opening until 2017, it housed two distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1141.492s">In</a> 2017, the Medford School Committee voted to merge the two schools into one comprehensive high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1146.355s">But</a> despite the forward-looking vision aimed at establishing one flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the Medford community, the facility is designed for the delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1159.583s">The</a> challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated by the increasing severity of infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1169.417s">MPS</a> envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programming and a host of vocational educational programs sanctioned under MGL Chapter 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1179.973s">But</a> the 55-year-old facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1185.998s">Medford</a> High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1192.142s">Over</a> 50% of these students are CTE students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1195.965s">Additionally,</a> MHS houses a preschool program that includes X students and a daycare for children ages X to X that has an enrollment of X together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1205.531s">This</a> total enrollment of current students is Y. So we have a few blanks to fill in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1210.774s">The</a> district's agreed upon enrollment projection for a new MHS is 1800 students of this figure 1395 are grade 9 to 12 high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1220.002s">200</a> are pre K students and 100 students are students in district state care. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1225.807s">So</a> we need to shore up those numbers based on our enrollment certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1232.893s">But</a> those are placeholders to describe what we've got going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1237.417s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1238.358s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1276.774s">Any</a> other thoughts about what might need to be added there?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1305.74s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1308.538s">That's</a> a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1310.239s">Do</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1321.049s">We</a> can come back to this too if we get to the end and think like, oh, there's something else we should be adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1326.874s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1329.532s">You</a> don't have to speak now or forever hold your peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1333.334s">The</a> next section is our project objectives under that we're thinking about and they did provide a list of things that we might want to put in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1344.918s">I</a> sort of broadly accepted that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1350.76s">And</a> I just reordered them, so identification of community concerns that may impact study options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1356.765s">So,</a> I think we want to be very upfront that we care about the community input of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1364.471s">The</a> Northeast collaborative for high performing schools and or the US Green Building Council leads for school certification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1375.128s">The</a> life cycle costs of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets, of course, that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1381.453s">A</a> CM at risk delivery method. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1384.737s">So</a> I do think that is a growing trend in school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1389.821s">And</a> given the uncertainty in the environment, we probably definitely want our CMs on board sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1397.915s">And</a> then planning to ensure learning continuity for all students and particularly for our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1403.58s">So</a> I think that is 1 of those things that feels very unique to us in other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1409.064s">If</a> you need to display students, you have the option of temporary trailers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1413.508s">You</a> have many options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1414.489s">You</a> can't you can't put the culinary program in a temporary trailer and think that they're going to be able to continue their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1421.615s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1422.315s">I</a> do think we have some particular things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1427.56s">Vetting</a> potential alternate sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1429.062s">So</a> we have identified a handful of alternate site potentials, and we would want to make sure we're doing our due diligence about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1439.291s">And</a> then I did add in site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if the new project remains <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1447.77s">in</a> place, meaning if Medford High is going to continue to be at 489 Winthrop Street, um, I think one thing that we've talked about is, um, the need for an additional egress and how very complicated that actually is given its where it sits and how it's situated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1467.403s">Um,</a> so I thought that might be a good thing to call out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1470.466s">It's</a> like something special that we should be <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1474.398s">making</a> people aware of as they think about their, their bid responses to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1482.604s">Did</a> anybody come up with anything else that we might want to add? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1504.37s">Okay,</a> we can come back if anybody is inspired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1510.811s">All</a> the rest of this is all very, very standard until we get to evaluation criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1519.473s">And</a> what we are required to do is be transparent about how we will rate and evaluate our bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1530.763s">And</a> the list here was broadly provided by the template. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1536.066s">So</a> you can see that the changes here are really my starting place of points. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1542.69s">And</a> then really the only thing I added was like this piece about knowledge and experience with the CM at-risk procurement methodology. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1551.31s">Um,</a> so before I, like, go through all of these top to bottom, I actually worked sort of from the bottom up and I. Generally assigned 10 points to the thing that I feel like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1565.197s">We're</a> sort of compulsory, so, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1569.099s">Mostly</a> down here, like, um, identifying the current projected workload for projects that are substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1576.423s">Familiar</a> with, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1578.852s">the</a> LEED certifications and demonstrated experience, knowledge of the purpose and practices of the services of building commissioning consultants, the CM knowledge of procurement law. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1597.607s">Those</a> were the ones that I felt like, okay, <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1601.421s">You</a> sort of aren't in this game if you don't know those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1605.765s">So</a> I sort of gave that like a compulsory level 10 points. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1611.271s">And</a> then from there, I said, okay, what are the things that sort of escalate and are, but are still like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1617.057s">what</a> I would consider to be sort of table stakes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1620.279s">So</a> things like knowledge and demonstrated experience with life cycle cost analysis and cost estimating with actual examples of how they've done this in various communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1633.307s">And</a> the CM at risk felt like something that was a little bit less everybody does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1640.911s">So</a> that felt like something that might warrant <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1644.769s">20</a> points, as well as, um, a little bit of increased emphasis on, um, state building code, particularly around the ADA, because I think we have, um, a lot of energy and need to make sure that our buildings, um, are compliant and serve students, um, with all kinds of abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1665.533s">So</a> that was sort of my 20 point bracket as it were. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1670.595s">And</a> then there was like a 30 point bracket, which was really capacity and skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1675.799s">So</a> talk to us about how many people you have and how they would be involved in our project, the management approach and the kinds of things that they're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1693.512s">And</a> there was one more 30 point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1696.455s">That</a> was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1697.816s">Then</a> there was a 40 point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1700.376s">bracket</a> around key personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1702.097s">So</a> who are these people that are going to work with us every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1704.659s">And</a> are they people that are a good fit for us with their experience and their approach to school buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1713.725s">And</a> then 50 points being allocated to past performance and the kinds of projects that they've worked on that align with what we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1732.282s">That</a> all tallies up to 270 points, which is why we have such an odd scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1737.504s">But</a> I felt like it was easier to keep the points section normalized and bracketed like that than it was to try to get to 100 points. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1748.287s">Because</a> then we'd be awarding 12 points and 17 points and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1755.57s">So</a> if I go back to the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1762.553s">happy</a> for you all to tell me that's the craziest thing you've ever tried to make sense of this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1770.216s">So</a> it was nice to have a starting list from the MSBA to say, this is what we, you know, these are the kinds of things we should be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1779.26s">Um,</a> and so with the exception of the CM at risk, the list really didn't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1784.022s">Um,</a> I was just curious if anybody has any thoughts or feedback on like the points allocation here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1803.631s">Okay,</a> I will fill these X's and Y's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1811.253s">And</a> then once we complete that process of reviewing the <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1832.007s">respondents,</a> we then create a short list essentially of the highest scoring firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1841.433s">And</a> then we would then sort of start over with the ranking and talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1850.286s">How</a> we plan to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1852.547s">I</a> actually was surprised they didn't have anything super specific about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1856.429s">So</a> I basically said at this point, we're going to talk about the quality of 3 reference checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1865.954s">The</a> quality of the finalist presentation and the value presented in the cost proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1872.836s">So,</a> not to say it's going to be the lowest bid, but the best value bid, all things considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1879.277s">So</a> this, I felt like it was a little easier to like, tally to 100 points. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1885.799s">And</a> welcome any additions to this list.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1980.392s">Sienna,</a> are you saying that the cost proposal cannot be a factor in our finalist selection?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2031.523s">Right,</a> so I just changed it a little bit to say that the final 20 points is based on the value presented in the bidder's technical response and the cost proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2043.291s">Because</a> to me, it's a package deal, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2045.212s">Like,</a> if Paul wants to charge $10 and he's going to give us <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2051.984s">2</a> widgets and Aaron is going to charge us 20 dollars and in fact, we assess that the very same 2 widgets are available, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2063.329s">The</a> value conversation sort of shifts to cost, but if. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2068.371s">Paul's</a> widgets and Aaron's widgets aren't the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2071.192s">We</a> have to make a value decision about which widget we want and how then the cost lines up with those choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2082.036s">So</a> to me, in a finalist situation, you would want to be thinking about cost at least on some level, but in a value context. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2092.28s">So</a> does that change of wording make it <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2097.055s">okay</a> from a procurement perspective, Fiona?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2116.373s">So</a> I will put this for you to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2120.196s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2211.737s">So</a> yeah, I guess my thinking was that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2221.077s">you</a> know, if I were doing this evaluation, that would be the last, you know, we, that would be the last thing we would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2228.919s">We</a> would, you know, open those, those cost bids at the, after the presentations are done and after the scoring is complete for the reference checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2237.922s">And</a> then that would be like the final way for us to say, okay, where do my points go now? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2244.583s">Like,</a> what, what am I willing to, <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2247.471s">assigned</a> based on the bigger picture, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2251.252s">So</a> that was my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2252.293s">So</a> Fiona, I will send you a copy of this so you can just take a look at that and confirm that that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2260.716s">My</a> thoughts on next steps are to bring this to the building committee on Monday the 24th and get their, you know, get their agreement and their feedback, obviously, because we have lots of talented, qualified people in the mix. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2278.356s">At</a> our larger committee, so we would want to get their input and then we'll be ready to send this to the pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2286.242s">And</a> to get their feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2293.308s">Okay,</a> so this next section. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2302.395s">Gets</a> a little bit wacky. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2305.34s">We</a> have to outline our selection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2309.942s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2316.025s">Include</a> as a documentation of rankings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2320.767s">Which</a> I believe we have basically done at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2330.571s">So</a> we should be good there we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2334.95s">have</a> to fill some of this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2336.11s">So</a> this is the OPM selection committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2339.851s">And</a> we will talk through this process that we will identify and describe the interview process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2348.293s">And</a> the committee's basis of ranking after the interviews, we will outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2357.255s">So</a> those are things that we have to do in this process, as well as if I scroll down, <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2367.1s">And</a> we may want to include provisions to re advertise if we get not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2374.362s">Responses,</a> so this, I didn't actually make that much progress filling out, but would welcome any thoughts or comments on this section.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2419.261s">So,</a> it does talk about the identify reviewers must rank their responses based on the weighted evaluation criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2427.953s">Um,</a> and must shortlist our minimum of 3 responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2431.395s">So</a> we don't really have choices there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2433.156s">That's</a> a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2436.519s">We</a> do have to describe our interview process and we'll talk about the dates in just a 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2442.863s">Um,</a> but. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2444.464s">I'm</a> guessing this is a place where we might want to say, like, we will invite. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2451.907s">Like,</a> we, you know, we may say, like, we'll invite shortlisted respondents to a meeting that is not to exceed a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2461.069s">And</a> in that meeting, they'll be invited to provide an overview of their proposal and in advance of that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2471.498s">We</a> may provide them a list of questions to, um, to respond to that are specific to the details of their proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2478.943s">So</a> we could do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2481.244s">Um,</a> I don't know if you have typical language that you use for something like that, or if anybody has any suggestions or thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2488.428s">That,</a> um, about the time, you know, what is an appropriate amount of time for such a finalist meeting to be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2514.503s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2561.759s">So</a> the MSBA requires that we talk to three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2566.264s">It</a> does? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2566.685s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2567.385s">Yeah,</a> we have to shortlist three.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2625.499s">Um,</a> so what I am saying here is no longer than 2 hours in length, um, and the interview will include an opportunity for the better to present an overview of their proposal and a chance to answer questions that we provide to them at least 48 hours in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2640.335s">Does</a> anyone have any other thoughts about what that bullet might need to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2658.149s">The</a> next one says outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee and what documentation the owner will require. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2665.295s">I</a> was curious, Fiona, if you had any input on what that might mean.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2735.796s">And</a> I did change this to a requirement saying that we reserve the right to re-advertise if less than three responses are received or to re-advertise if fee negotiations fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2760.988s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2762.109s">If</a> we move on to the timeline, <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2769.64s">What</a> I did, I actually sent some questions to our contact to just get a little bit more context about this review cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2779.23s">So</a> this timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2782.735s">anchors</a> to two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2784.256s">One</a> is that we're like ready to post this the day after we get the go-ahead to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2789.4s">So</a> that is still very much a TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2792.182s">And</a> the other thing this anchors to is the scheduled OPM review panel meeting that happens in early April. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2804.162s">They</a> happen on a monthly basis, so pending information from our contact about the. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2812.319s">The</a> review timeline up front, and then the. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2817.147s">the</a> process to be at an OPM review panel meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2821.97s">We</a> may need to slide this whole thing in one direction or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2826.013s">But</a> my goal is that we're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2828.234s">So</a> I think as you look at this timeline, I would think about it in terms of its proximity one step to the next, knowing that the whole thing could slide out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2841.023s">based</a> on some input from MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2843.585s">So</a> it wouldn't happen faster than this or sooner than this, but it could happen later than this and sort of we would slide the whole thing accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2852.584s">Having</a> said that, 2-27 would be the date that we push this in the central register, as well as a newspaper, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2863.667s">We</a> would hold an informational meeting and site inspection on 3-6, which is about a week later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2869.068s">The</a> following day, we would have it be the last day for questions from respondents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2877.05s">The</a> following week we would have responses due so that does give bidders like two full weeks to put their responses together and my understanding is that's pretty typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2889.537s">Then</a> by the following week we would have done our work to identify who the shortlisted participants are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2896.601s">A</a> week after that within the next week we would <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2900.954s">Interview</a> our shortlist respondents and we'll publish the 2 dates where we would plan to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2906.036s">We'll</a> sort of block time for whoever the committee is in order to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2911.719s">Then</a> we would begin negotiations immediately filing, which is like the Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2916.381s">We</a> would let MSBA know on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2919.703s">41</a> and then by 47, we're ready to talk to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2925.038s">OPM</a> review panel and with an expectation that we'd finish the contract by the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2934.36s">Does</a> that feel terrifying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=2996.832s">Okay,</a> and in order to do that, Fiona, I think what you're saying is there is no chance for us to be at the review panel meeting on the 7th of April.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3034.814s">Okay,</a> because those review panel meetings are fixed meetings, like, they are on a calendar that it's not ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3042.28s">So</a> 2 things I can send you this timeline and we can make those adjustments and I can also seek some guidance from MSBA about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3053.088s">The</a> lead time required and and. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3057.471s">Whether,</a> um. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3060.318s">We</a> do need to, in fact, slide this out, or if there's some other way they would ground this for communities that are ready to go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3095.974s">So,</a> it sounds like we do have to shift everything out maybe by 1 week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3102.197s">And</a> I think the only question then, and maybe you and I can look at the timeline and figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3107.959s">Yeah,</a> if. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3110.258s">There's</a> a possibility for us to make this selection more quickly, like what would that entail? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3117.504s">So</a> let me get some answers to that from our contact, and then I will circle up with you about what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3129.334s">And</a> then I think we have to determine whether we're going to add folks to the selection committee or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3137.201s">But</a> then we also will need to block the dates and times for the meetings that we'll have to have to do these reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3150.13s">Fiona,</a> since this is all subject to the open meeting law, our meetings are open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3164.395s">And</a> I guess my question is, how do we protect, I guess, various bidders from their competitors sitting through these conversations? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3187.332s">How</a> is that done, typically?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3361.395s">Oh,</a> and I think the central thing that may be different in this procurement is that the procurement is being done by a body that is subject to the open meeting law, which is completely different than how a typical, like, procurement in the city would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3377.644s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3378.004s">Like,</a> certainly there's public records, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3381.146s">You</a> all don't work under the open meeting law in the same way that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3386.529s">Like,</a> we do on the school committee, or this body does so I can seek some clarification from MSBA about that as well in terms of, like, how do all of these things fit together? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3396.213s">So</a> I will see what I can come up with there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3399.454s">That's</a> very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3400.535s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3403.996s">Okay,</a> and then the rest of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3409.879s">Um,</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3414.733s">Sort</a> of filling in some of the same information that has been held elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3418.882s">We</a> are requiring hard copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3421.727s">So</a> we'll need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3423.01s">Determine</a> how big the committee is, so we can make sure we get enough copies. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3427.827s">And</a> then if I keep going, there's a section here that says, the owner shall list any and all certifications here that the respondent will be required to submit as attachment D required certifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3443.73s">The</a> owner should consult with its legal counsel to determine what certifications may be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3447.671s">So,</a> Fiona, I didn't know if this was a question for Howard or a question for you in terms of what certifications we may be requiring people to provide.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3478.127s">All</a> of this is very typical and then we get to the end and there's a series of attachments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3484.069s">So</a> we'll need to provide all of these documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3488.03s">What</a> I did add to it is our educational profile and our Chapter 74 viability program, because we worked really hard on those documents and describing what we thought the educational programming should be here in Medford that is driving our <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3504.421s">you</a> know, thoughts around this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3506.021s">So,</a> um, those things will need to be, um, attached as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3511.023s">So,</a> and those documents exist, so that's not a problem.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3515.444s">Um,</a> and everything else is, um, boilerplate attachment for the bidders to fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3528.307s">Uh,</a> and yeah, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3537.777s">Questions,</a> thoughts, places you want to go back to? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3568.958s">So</a> I think there are maybe two things left to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3573.32s">One</a> might be a motion to bring this for a final input with its amendments to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3588.509s">And</a> the other might be to recommend to the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3595.529s">an</a> expansion of this team of voting members, which right now stands at Dr. Cushing, Aaron and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3602.473s">So,</a> um, those are the 2 things sort of on my mind that we may want to do in terms of votes tonight so that we can be prepared to bring those back to the committee on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3613.259s">Thoughts</a> about that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3631.438s">What</a> my main feeling was that maybe it shouldn't be just the three of us making this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3638.023s">But</a> I hadn't really, you know, an odd number seems prudent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3645.809s">So</a> I hadn't really thought about it or the makeup of those additional folks any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3653.637s">So</a> totally open to suggestions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3713.566s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3731.751s">Is</a> adding to make sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3819.228s">Would</a> it make sense to entertain a motion to recommend increasing the size of the OPM selection committee from three to five to the full committee, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3831.422s">That</a> will give us sort of an opening for the committee to think about that and make those appointments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3848.569s">From</a> three to five.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3851.71s">So</a> motion by Dr. Cushing, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3854.411s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3859.703s">roll</a> call jenny graham yes dr cushing yes um aaron lapati yes green the affirmative zero on the negative motion passes so we'll bring that back to the committee to try to increase the party here just a little bit um and um i think the other question is is there a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3888.246s">bring</a> this adjusted RFS to the full committee for input.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3899.655s">By</a> Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3904.039s">Jenny</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3905.86s">Aaron</a> Olapade.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3909.143s">And</a> Dr. Cushing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3912.546s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3917.372s">Okay,</a> I think if I'm going to flip back quickly to our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3928.557s">We</a> have talked about the key elements of Module 2, we have reviewed and edited the drafted RFS, and we have also discussed the vetting and selection process during our review. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3942.224s">So,</a> the only thing left to do is adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3945.385s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3951.25s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3954.378s">Aaron?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3958.689s">Peter?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3960.514s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3961.015s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3961.416s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3963.923s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3964.685s">Meeting</a> adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3965.226s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3966.871s">Thank</a> you, everybody.<h2><a href="../2025-02-11_0FSPW3s1sRE/2025-02-11_0FSPW3s1sRE.html">Regular MSC Meeting - 2.10.2025</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2975.835s">The</a> same as Nedford Residence?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3024.779s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3028.081s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3031.242s">My</a> math is, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3032.923s">not</a> necessarily in agreement with your math here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3036.227s">So</a> what I looked at was if we accept the recommendation to go to $250, but we essentially also accept the 20% discount, which would essentially hold tuition at where it was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3054.553s">If</a> I said 38% of our students would pay $200 a week and 62% of our students would pay $250 a week using the 684, I come up with a net potential revenue of $158,004. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3060.035s">If</a> I shift that to say half of our students pay $200 and half pay $250, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3080.487s">I</a> come up with 153,900. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3083.208s">So</a> while I agree that the 70% discount is not affordable, I am not seeing how the 20% discount would not be viable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3140.739s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3141.139s">I</a> mean, I think my concern with that is there's, you know, lots of places in our storied history in Medford where people point to lack of transparency, lack of accountability, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3152.155s">cherry</a> picking, favoritism, you name it, it comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3155.137s">So</a> I do think from a programming perspective, I understand that Mr. Petrellis has the best of intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3163.802s">But</a> if somebody were to bring an allegation forward, that sits with this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3168.865s">And</a> I would really rather avoid putting Mr. Petrellis in a situation where he's having to defend trying to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3175.328s">So</a> I do think there need to be clear rules and I think there need to be clearly published tuitions that accompany those rules so that the rules of engagement for everybody are clear and parents who may or may not feel comfortable saying to Mr. Petrellis, hey, I need some help, like being willing and able to say, hey, I need some help requires an immense amount of <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3198.174s">like</a> understanding of the system versus like, here are the two programs, here are these possibilities for you so that people can do their homework and understand that if A, then B, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3211.144s">Like</a> if I meet this, then I get X versus I have to go talk to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3216.208s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3216.989s">Am</a> I making a case? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3218.05s">Am</a> I trying to convince him? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3219.171s">Do</a> I need to buy him candy? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3220.332s">Like</a> what is like, it sort of conjures up a lot of things that people <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3224.555s">get</a> scared about and then frankly don't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3226.696s">It</a> probably also contributes to the bounced checks that we see, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3231.277s">Those</a> could be families who simply couldn't afford to send their kid, but had no choice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3237.359s">Needed</a> childcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3238.659s">So</a> my math says, even if half of our students need support, our total tuition, either 153,000 or 158,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3252.272s">would</a> still be $20,000 more than last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3257.205s">And</a> if payroll is only $96, there's a lot of room there to make those adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3262.788s">So</a> unless I'm missing something, my motion would be to hold tuition at $200 for those who can demonstrate financial need, to increase tuition for everybody else to $250, and to increase tuition for non-residents to $300 a week.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3289.846s">So</a> families who can demonstrate financial need through eligibility in what would otherwise be free and reduced lunch, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3300.152s">200,</a> which is the same as last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3302.993s">All</a> other families will see an increase from 200 to 250. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3308.676s">Out-of-town</a> participants, we love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3312.799s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3314.3s">It's</a> a $300 a week tuition.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3375.194s">So</a> I would amend my motion to say as established on April on the April 1st reports for financial eligibility.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3387.218s">From</a> December to April so I want to use the what is sort of closest to
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3573.738s">My</a> my impression as well Anthony is that the communications team can support some of that work, because I think last time last two weeks ago whenever that was we also talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3585.576s">That</a> the idea of. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3589.244s">allowing</a> all of this to happen in an online format so there's no checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3594.328s">So</a> all of that I think is going to require support from Will and the website team anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3599.512s">So</a> I think putting all of that together as a package is something that you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3605.237s">expect</a> assistance with from central administration.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3735.879s">And</a> Mayor, can I just make one more comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3738.46s">If</a> you're going to change the salary stipends associated with the program, can you bring them to us so that we can have an understanding of what those are before they go into effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3750.323s">Because</a> we are supposed to, I think we're supposed to be in approval of all of those things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3781.737s">Wow,</a> what an interesting wrinkle. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3783.558s">I</a> think if they're residents, they're residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3786.079s">They</a> live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3787.979s">They</a> get the resident rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3789.74s">But</a> I'd be super interested to know what the enrollment breakdown is, actually, which is a totally separate conversation for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3795.722s">But</a> I think that would actually be really fascinating to learn about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3868.593s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3869.174s">We</a> all, I think, received some emails from our color guard students who were talking about this upcoming trip to Pennsylvania and <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3880.514s">One</a> of the things that brought up for me was really around some of the one-off actions that we've taken as a committee over the last couple of years, albeit we had lesser money to rely on, which we no longer have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3896.821s">But</a> we have funded out-of-state field trips in certain instances based upon people coming to the podium and making a request and for us saying like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3908.773s">want</a> students to have to go out and fundraise and miss trips in order to be able, you know, in order to be able to send some but not all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3917.343s">So</a> with that money source drying up and with sort of a broad acknowledgement that there's a lot of field trips across the district and there's things like <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3928.527s">nationals</a> for athletics and nationals for band and color guard and the ethics bowl and the robotics competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3936.412s">There's</a> all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3937.992s">And</a> we have not set a policy around what we think we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3945.177s">And</a> I think I would love to say for us to be able to say, we should pay for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3950.7s">But</a> before we do that, we should think about what a policy might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3955.843s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3957.393s">if</a> we are going to bring forward a recommendation to pay for things, obviously that has to be budgeted and all the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3962.795s">And</a> we would need to understand like, what is the potential cost of such a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3968.378s">So</a> this is just simply to say that the rules and policy subcommittee will take this up and we'll draft a policy, think about the different kinds of field trips, work with the administration, and then also, you know, think about what the financial impact of whatever the recommendation is so that <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3985.423s">Our</a> classes, our advisors, our students, like they know what the rules of the road are and it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3992.822s">sort</a> of a squeaky wheel situation where we have some things being funded and not others. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3998.706s">So</a> I, you know, we might have to take some baby steps to get to a reality where we don't have to ask students to fundraise and pay for things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4008.232s">But</a> the first step in baby steps is to like decide like where it is that you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4013.055s">So</a> my hope is that the policy will help us establish where we want to go and then quantify like what, you know, what are the steps we might take to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4022.44s">This</a> is just to move it to subcommittee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4091.853s">Motion</a> for approval by. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4093.155s">Can</a> I just say something? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4094.877s">Yes,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4096.419s">Just</a> to clarify the addition with, you know, when we added Mr. Brown to the committee, he told me he was like in this for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4106.492s">He's</a> newly retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4109.16s">I'm</a> envious of his retirement, but I guess he's ready to actually be retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4114.023s">So</a> he sort of filled a spot that we talked about being really important, which is some additional voice from the MTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4122.688s">I</a> did go back through and there weren't a lot of other potential candidates who are still in the district, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4131.393s">So</a> this will allow us to go ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4135.615s">Cabral</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4136.936s">for</a> a recommendation for somebody who is both an MTA member and a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4142.781s">So</a> it's not two people, it's just one, but just an acknowledgement that that's going to happen outside of the initial application process so that there is somebody sort of filling that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4154.27s">And</a> then once this is approved and Marta works to identify that person, we'll have to submit this form to the MSBA, which is why we all need to approve it tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4187.926s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4188.526s">So</a> as you all know, we worked really hard to get all of our eligibility <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4194.932s">information</a> into the MSBA in early July. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4198.895s">We</a> worked with them really from July until December on what is called an enrollment certification, which is essentially the headcount of students that we will build a high school for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4211.306s">So</a> our current enrollment at the high school is about 1,200 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4216.675s">And</a> we've worked really hard with them to demonstrate what we see here in Medford in collaboration with the mayor's office and our head of planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4229.389s">We've</a> looked at permitted projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4232.572s">We've</a> looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4233.985s">future</a> potential projects we've had conversations, and we certified enrollment with MSBA at 1395 which is almost a 200 student increase which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4244.356s">I</a> think that's a really sort of nice number and a place for us to grow into. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4251.062s">Now,</a> the next step in the process is for us to authorize the feasibility study agreement, which is a standard agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4258.049s">It</a> outlines and reports on things that have already happened, like the approval of $3 million, et cetera, and allows the district to enter into this next phase where we will hire an owner's project manager and a designer to do the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4273.697s">and</a> this body needs to, is the approving body for the feasibility study funds to be expended in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4281.559s">So</a> we need to sign that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4283.759s">This</a> group will need to sign off on that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4287.66s">And</a> then the board meeting for the MSBA is the week after February vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4292.941s">I</a> think it's the 26th or 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4294.282s">So</a> it's my full expectation that the team will recommend to the board <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4301.143s">that</a> we be invited to the next phase, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4305.808s">The</a> building committee is going to get working starting tomorrow to get ready for those next phase deliverables so we can very quickly get an RFP out the door and be ready to hire owner's project manager and really get to this next phase, which is where like all those meaty questions get answered, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4322.4s">So</a> this group needs to give us authorization to sign that agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4327.901s">Howard,</a> Attorney Greenspan, has a document he'll fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4331.102s">The</a> mayor has something that she will sign on behalf of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4334.543s">And</a> then we will be off to the races for the board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4338.023s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4338.464s">That</a> meeting's the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4339.404s">24th,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-01-29_z9B9_JzAXRA/2025-01-29_z9B9_JzAXRA.html">MSC Special Meeting - 01.29.2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=138.902s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=457.312s">Yes,</a> I was going to say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=459.093s">I</a> think the key differentiator between Dr. Lucy and others who may have conflicts are that she is not a contract holder, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=467.357s">So</a> she doesn't have the voting authority to approve a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=470.538s">So</a> she therefore is sort of in a different lane of conflict of interest than the rest of us are. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=476.101s">members.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=476.722s">So</a> I forwarded you an email from Attorney Greenspan, who was not able to be here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=481.168s">And</a> there's a specific paragraph that I think would be useful to read out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=487.237s">That</a> is the official <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=490.542s">to</a> 68, a disclosure, whatever it's called, before we call a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=494.985s">And</a> then the way attorney Greenspan explained it to both myself and Dr. Lucy, they, they will, she will also file paperwork with the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=507.714s">And,</a> and he also reminded me that there have been other superintendents here in Medford in this exact same situation, this is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=515.06s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=516.02s">it's</a> not unusual in the superintendent's ranks to come across.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=4986.56s">Thank</a> you, I just had a couple of questions 1st, the flyer that's on the back of the packet that we received shows like a 6 week run and it looks like the 1st week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5003.63s">Sort</a> of this is from 2023, so it looks like the 1st week is roughly like. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5008.973s">the</a> week of 4th of July for a partial week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5011.734s">And</a> then it does end pretty abruptly in mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5014.175s">So</a> can you tell us what the plans are for this year's dates?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5031.562s">The</a> 8th is a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5032.462s">Yeah,</a> so the 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5035.051s">Okay,</a> so if I am thinking about, I know it's hard to figure out where school really ends, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5041.874s">That</a> means there is the 1 week gap between. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5046.896s">Maybe</a> roughly a 1 week gap before the camp gets going and then there's actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5054.797s">um</a> a two plus week gap in august um have we ever explored particularly covering those late weeks in august like that is a time when people really struggle for camps because camps wrap early so have we ever considered that those weeks just want me to take that dr cushing or
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5147.723s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5151.585s">I</a> was not thinking about the Andrews and the McGlynn being <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5156.767s">Consumed,</a> but I would like us to explore that for next year because I think particularly those late weeks are a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5167.059s">I</a> also would like to see a budget proposal for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5171.124s">So</a> that we can understand, like, I am all for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5176.838s">the</a> affordability of this camp but I would like to see a budget that says here's you know here's how many students we expect to have based on some set of assumptions which usually could lean on past performance here's what we anticipate the costs of the staffing that we need for that number of students to be and <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5201.85s">yes,</a> all of this works out and we're not operating in the red or in the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5208.032s">I</a> would also love to explore a sliding scale tuition program, much like we do with the after school program, because our students have parents with wide varieties of an ability to <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5228.212s">pay</a> for camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5228.992s">And</a> there are lots of kids who really love this camp, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5232.614s">And</a> I think we should be leaning more towards what we're doing with after school than setting sort of a blanket price. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5243.238s">And</a> with after school, we look at some thresholds of financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5248.06s">And</a> I would love to see an analysis that says if the rate is this, we can <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5254.862s">We</a> can do we can do some sort of sliding scale that reduces the rate and makes it even more affordable for those families who need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5262.53s">And</a> I know that's a big ask, but I, I would like to see us do that and think about what is reasonable for us to do this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5271.855s">You</a> know, Anthony, your point about people having experienced a tax increase is well taken and that's important money. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5279.779s">There's</a> important work that will come from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5282.981s">But</a> I would like us not to impose the same kind of increase across the board if we can avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5291.626s">So</a> I'm hoping that we could do that for maybe the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5299.23s">Is</a> that possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5300.11s">Do</a> you need me to make a motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5307.37s">Is</a> that for Dr. Cushing and for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5311.852s">I'm</a> assuming the finance office is going to need to be involved in that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5333.464s">Of</a> course, and I think, I would think, Anthony, that the finance office would need your input on the assumptions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5339.326s">Like</a> what is the enrollment, like the date, that kind of data, like the supplies that you need, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5345.608s">But</a> the finance office should be able to put that analysis together and be able to show us what's possible and whether doing some sort of sliding scale model off based on what we do with afterschool would be <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5360.988s">possible</a> this year or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5363.751s">Dr.</a> Cushing, is that feasible for our next meeting?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5490.813s">But,</a> yeah, I mean, to your point, we should be reviewing this probably in the fall every year so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5498.936s">We</a> can be 1 of the 1st options out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5501.777s">Um,</a> and, um, I think it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5505.98s">may</a> be reasonable for us right now to advertise what the dates will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5513.423s">And</a> that registration is forthcoming once the rates are agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5518.186s">So</a> I feel like if people know it's an option and that that's forthcoming, that's not going to change the game for people too much at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5527.19s">Because</a> all of those camps we're talking about, they're already out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5530.151s">So</a> I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5532.138s">I</a> think two weeks for a better pricing, for a better picture of pricing so that we're not charging too much or too little might make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5540.8s">And</a> then my final question is this form, which was from 2023, says that you need to send checks and money orders to Medford Community Schools with this paper form. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5554.144s">Have</a> we migrated this registration process to an online platform?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5629.338s">So</a> is it the plan that that will be available for this registration period or are you saying this will it will not be available for this registration period?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5640.308s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5642.17s">Okay</a> I appreciate that and I know it's a lot of work but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5646.84s">everyone</a> will appreciate it once we need to sort it out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5665.207s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5666.487s">I</a> don't think we want our staff <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5669.554s">responsible</a> for like sort of large swaths of cash because there's all kinds of like cash control questions that come into play when those processes are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5678.916s">So</a> if we can make that happen, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5682.196s">I</a> would like to make a motion to get an updated rate card and a program budget at the next meeting to specifically explore sliding scale of rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5696.906s">And</a> hopefully my colleagues will weigh in and let me know what they think about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6287.785s">Couldn't</a> hear what member Intoppa was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6289.906s">So</a> I'm unclear what amendment he was proposing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6334.072s">Is</a> the amendment to, in addition to creating a budget and proposing rates that might include a sliding scale, <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6346.515s">that</a> the administration would look to keep the camp as affordable as possible, is that the amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6360.778s">Or</a> is the amendment to prescribe a rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6364.519s">Because</a> I think that's a completely different thing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6730.304s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6733.51s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6734.711s">Um,</a> I'm happy to, um, amend the resolution to ask the administrations, ask the administration to recommend a budget, which by the way, would include the rates that we're proposing to pay staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6753.765s">Um,</a> and the number of staff that, um, explores a sliding scale and <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6763.769s">overall</a> is looking to be an affordable program versus a profit generating program. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6768.791s">I</a> think all of that can be accomplished, but you can't do that unless you go back and look at all the numbers, because the numbers on this page aren't enough to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6781.235s">that</a> we're even making solvent decisions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6783.957s">So</a> we need a bigger picture view of that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6787.16s">And</a> that's why I'm asking for this to be done next week so that the folks in the administration, which would not necessarily include Anthony, have the time to put this together and be thoughtful about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6800.371s">They</a> have all the tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6801.571s">All</a> of these tools exist within Medford Public Schools operations already.<h2><a href="../2025-01-14_pVNz2f7XJUQ/2025-01-14_pVNz2f7XJUQ.html">Regular MSC Meeting - 01.13.2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5010.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5012.134s">Just</a> one quick question or clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5013.836s">I</a> believe the one administrative assistant who was laid off was pretty quickly recalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5022.497s">to</a> fill an open position.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5026.303s">And</a> she declined. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5026.924s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5027.265s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that the committee knew that because it happened within like weeks of July one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5034.077s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7253.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7254.106s">I</a> actually had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7255.507s">I</a> think it is back on question seven, so my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7259.851s">The</a> facility conditioning assessments, that number looks different than the numbers that we had in our capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7270.701s">So</a> can you just give us a rundown of what that looks like? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7273.704s">what</a> number it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7275.747s">Sorry,</a> on page nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7278.03s">So</a> it says 146,000 for the facility condition assessments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7284.84s">So,</a> okay, so it's, it's not just the assessment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7333.908s">Okay,</a> and then my other related question, which again I think is question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7340.24s">Is</a> there were three there were three specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7345.932s">capital</a> projects that we identified in our capital plan as things we wanted to see accomplished in FY25, which includes fixing the issue that causes flooding in the kindergarten classroom at the McGlynn, the drainage at the Brooks School, and then the freight elevator motor <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7364.367s">And</a> I didn't see those in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7365.869s">Is</a> that because they're somewhere else, or are they not able to be accounted for in 25?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7405.703s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7406.523s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7408.304s">And</a> then, Mayor, I think there might be some people in the audience who wanna speak when the committee's done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8917.247s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8919.227s">I</a> also had the chance to sit on the superintendent search committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8930.513s">I</a> was not on the school committee at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8934.375s">But</a> one of the things that was so striking during that process is every time we talked to you, I thought to myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8942.474s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent has a coaching mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8945.276s">And</a> it was one of the like prevailing things I thought about you as we were interviewing what felt like an endless number of candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8953.042s">And</a> they all were so different. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8954.163s">There</a> was not two people that were the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8956.845s">And</a> one of the things that is so evident about the work that you've done here is that coaching mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8963.85s">So</a> you truly look for your entire team to deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8968.533s">It's</a> not just about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8969.814s">It's</a> not just about, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8971.275s">any</a> one person, and I've always appreciated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8974.897s">I</a> feel like that hasn't always been easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8976.598s">And</a> I think there have been times where you have brought forward an idea like investing in professional development so that our evaluators could do a better job evaluating our staff in their service to children. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8992.587s">And</a> I do remember you getting considerable pushback about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8996.71s">So</a> the other thing I think about when I think about your time here <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9000.592s">is</a> that you weren't afraid to start the ball moving in a direction that it hadn't moved before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9007.538s">And</a> being the person that starts things is really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9010.881s">It</a> means convincing people that it's gonna be okay to do this new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9016.386s">It</a> means convincing people that we can do this and the other things that we were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9021.871s">And</a> it also means saying no to the way things have always been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9026.535s">And</a> I have really appreciated your willingness to hold the line and to say no to the way things have always been done here in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9035.724s">It's</a> incredibly important in a district like ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9038.486s">It</a> is the way change gets made and the people who are willing to start the ball rolling up the hill have the very hardest job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9047.615s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9049.766s">Lucas</a> asked me the other day what you were going to do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9053.749s">And</a> I said, whatever she does, I hope she has time to take a nap because it's been seven very long years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=9060.073s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-12-16_5kvVHmOpvvU/2024-12-16_5kvVHmOpvvU.html">Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7789.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7789.382s">I</a> just want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7791.405s">I've</a> been on many several of these calls over the last couple of months and I know the team is working really hard, and that there's a lot of unknown in this in the equation right even though we're like well down the path I know there's still so many variables that you're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7808.081s">And</a> most recently, we had a lot of conversation about like the timing of bringing these things forward, not only here, but to the council, because it is a significant bond in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7819.086s">So</a> how do we sort of balance the need to get moving, if we want to be able to do this work in the summer, which meant like we've got to do this now, with the like, still developing and coming into like focus <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7833.753s">work</a> that has to be done to really hone the whole budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7836.274s">So</a> I think this is a great solution and I just wanted to say thank you because I know this has been a tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7845.322s">All</a> of these things are on the capital plan, which we'll talk about in just a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7848.864s">But</a> the other thing we'll talk about in the capital plan is the desire that this committee has expressed before to commission or recommission buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7858.368s">And</a> I've had some preliminary conversation with that, which I'll share later. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7863.09s">Because</a> the reason we got here is because we didn't do the things we should have been doing all along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7868.392s">And</a> then it was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7869.944s">okay</a> everything failed and now the Andrews is sweltering hot and the McGlynn is right behind it and we have three other buildings that were built at exactly the same time like they're going to come right around the bend pretty quickly and they have all the same challenges that that these two complexes have so the other thing that we'll talk about when we talk about the capital plan is <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7891.201s">How</a> do we do better right now for a future us? <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7895.622s">So</a> that future us doesn't have to be grappling with the same kinds of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7900.723s">So</a> that's more to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7903.924s">But</a> this team has been very helpful in all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7907.445s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7908.905s">And</a> then I would like to make a motion to approve proceeding with the project and to recommend to the council that they <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7919.668s">take</a> the steps that they need to take to issue this initial bond so that the team can remain on track and we can have working air. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7929.734s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7930.815s">So</a> motion to approve the project at this stage and recommend that the council proceed with the process to secure the initial bond so that there's no further, there's no delay in the project.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7975.669s">As</a> long as we can do it tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8760.547s">I</a> did provide you all a printout. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8763.128s">I</a> know it's quite small. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8764.269s">There's</a> a lot of columns and things that are happening on this capital plan, but I did want to go through just in a little bit of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8772.752s">So</a> we've met, we met multiple times as a subcommittee and we really worked through all the things that were on the capital plan that we created. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8782.856s">sort</a> of last year in like May and now we're moving into a different timeline where we have these things happening a little bit more proactively because to create a capital plan at the end of May means there's not really a whole lot of time either to figure out how to like absorb something into the budget or ask for funds from the city if there's something urgent and so it sort of perpetuates this like cycle of us doing things when <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8811.411s">staff</a> breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8812.712s">And</a> part of the goal of the budget policy and the capital planning policy that we put forward was to try to break that cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8822.815s">So</a> we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8824.196s">I</a> think we're actually a little bit ahead of schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8828.252s">And</a> what you have before you is our view at a point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8833.255s">It's</a> actually changed since I printed it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8835.776s">That's</a> what happens with these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8837.357s">So</a> I'll give you a couple of what I think are pertinent updates as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8842.459s">But</a> if you look at the top, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8845.0s">The</a> first section are all projects that are either in progress or funded to be started. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8852.383s">And</a> for the most part, they are things that are well in motion, much of which we just talked about with HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8858.445s">But</a> there's a couple of things that are worth noting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8860.826s">So</a> the fire pump control work at the McGlynn Elementary Middle School is actually complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8866.429s">So</a> the work <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8867.569s">is</a> completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8868.129s">It's</a> all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8868.73s">We're</a> good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8869.37s">But</a> it felt exciting to put something in complete status from a project standpoint on the on the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8875.493s">So</a> we made note of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8878.211s">The</a> LED light replacement, Dr. Cushing has been talking with us about LED light replacement for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8885.936s">And</a> this is the final leg of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8888.558s">The</a> cost that you see that sort of spread out over the course of FY 25, 26, on and on and on, those are on bill payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8900.106s">So</a> they sort of get absorbed into our electric costs in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8905.569s">So</a> there's no budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8909.271s">for</a> that needs to be new. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8910.872s">It's</a> already planned for in our budget and it's about $300,000 per building over the course of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8917.534s">So</a> that's why you see 60, 60, 60, 60, 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8921.556s">The</a> solar roof and battery we talked about just a little while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8924.837s">So</a> the city's ARPA funds are paying for that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8929.479s">That</a> solar roof no longer battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8932.66s">So</a> that's a small update. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8936.261s">that</a> solar roof project has been going on since before I was on the school committee or ever considered being on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8942.764s">So,</a> it's a long time coming and it has, you know, we couldn't put solar on the roof until we had a roof that was worth putting solar on top and all of the steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8951.069s">So,</a> that's been a long time coming but certainly, we'll look forward to the advantages of that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8958.692s">The</a> next several lines are sort of wrapped up in the HVAC replacement at Andrews and at McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8964.634s">The</a> roof rebuild slash solar at McGlynn is listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8969.816s">The</a> networked closet mini splits, so those are air conditioning units that are required to keep all of our IT infrastructure running and not melting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8981.361s">That</a> is part and parcel of this bigger project that we've been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8986.245s">So</a> all of those pieces are what we just discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8990.75s">And</a> that would be the pieces that are subject to the approval of the project at this stage, as well as the recommendation to the council so that they can proceed with the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9002.641s">There</a> are many steps, as I understand it, on the council side. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9005.362s">So</a> we definitely want to make sure we get to that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9007.684s">But</a> the other things that are on this list, the next item on the list is the failed flashing behind the brick facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9020.191s">this</a> is in progress in that we have some design work completed but it does need funding and it's about $100,000 and this is what causes it to rain inside an interior kindergarten classroom when the wind and the rain goes sideways against the building in just the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9040.945s">So,</a> that is something that we've been talking about but if you look in the project status and recommendation column, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9048.55s">There's</a> a recommendation that we proceed with that in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9053.294s">And</a> anything that says recommend proceeding in FY25, that's a cue if we approve this as it's written to ask that these things be considered in the supplemental budget that'll come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9065.404s">in</a> January, and if they cannot be included in the supplemental budget, those would be things we would probably need to have another conversation about in terms of asking and requesting money from the city to be able to prioritize those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9077.132s">So</a> we have replaced things in that poor kindergarten classroom like three times now because of flooding, and that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9090.041s">It</a> is a very sort of wacky problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9092.806s">It's</a> not the roof exactly, but it's the brick and some of what's happening behind the brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9100.037s">So</a> that is on the list of like in progress because there is some amount of design work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9105.623s">bike</a> rack modernization. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9107.264s">Um</a> this was actually funded by the community preservation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9110.525s">So,</a> it is in progress and you'll see the grant eligibility listed listing that there is a funding by the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9119.128s">Um</a> the MHS classroom phone access is a a project that's ongoing with the district's sort of conversion over to a new phone system and there's no capital <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9135.133s">And</a> then the last thing in the in progress section is the hot water heater replacement at the Brooks that did receive money from the stabilization fund in October and the work was beginning today actually and will be done over the break. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9149.04s">So</a> the hot water situation at the Brooks will be resolved when everyone is back from the holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9155.684s">Any</a> questions so far?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9163.109s">I</a> know it's just a lot to take in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9164.37s">So</a> the next section are the either future or unfunded projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9169.411s">And</a> I'm going to take them in a couple of categories as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9173.792s">The</a> first one on the list is the historic assessment to address the front stairwell and ADA accessibility improvements for the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9182.174s">So</a> this is just again an assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9185.197s">There</a> is an application pending with the CPC so that is there's no action for us to take but just more of a note for all of us that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9194.225s">The</a> bike rack modernization for the outside schools so Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9202.172s">the</a> subcommittee is recommending that the district apply for CPC funding to match the funding that was already approved for McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9213.658s">So</a> that is that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9214.558s">So</a> those are our two CPC sort of near term projects that are outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9221.962s">The</a> next handful are things that if you look in the status column, it says recommend proceeding in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9230.914s">So</a> that means these are the things that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9233.288s">We</a> feel like our urgent have been lingering. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9236.589s">We</a> have not addressed in some time or are really critical in terms of advancing our objective to be more proactive about maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9244.913s">So</a> I'll just take them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9246.394s">The</a> HVAC and roof mini recommissioning assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9250.276s">Those</a> are my very unscientific words, but essentially we have three other buildings that have systems just as old as the McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9262.721s">And</a> if we can facilitate like a mini reconditioning project, it could help inform us whether we should consider applying in this round of accelerated repair through MSBA for a possible grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9283.898s">Accelerated</a> repair just opened today, and it will stay open until it usually stays open till sometime in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9291.684s">accelerated</a> repairs for things like roofs and boilers, and the MSBA will match the, you know, typically there's again there's a reimbursement rate that's always sort of subject to a question but provide partial funding grant funding to replace those systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9309.051s">What</a> I did learn about accelerated repair this round is that they're opening accelerated repair this round. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9318.255s">And</a> those districts who are awarded will get notification probably about this time next year that they were successful or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9326.197s">But</a> then they're moving to an every other year accelerated repair schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9330.379s">So</a> that means if we do not apply in 2025, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9333.84s">we</a> cannot apply until 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9335.741s">So</a> my hope is that we can find a way to fund those mini assessments to inform the question of can we wait to apply until 2027 or do we really need to sort of move quickly and <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9350.886s">be</a> in a position to apply in 2025 for matching grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9353.787s">I</a> did confirm that districts can have an accelerated repair project going on at the same time as what they call a core project, which is what Medford High School is. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9364.552s">So</a> I do think, and it's about the TBD, that number came in since I printed this at like four o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9370.654s">So</a> it's about $25,000 per school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9372.695s">So</a> we'd be talking about $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9373.595s">Member</a> Ruseau, do you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9419.665s">It's</a> 2028 when the work gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9422.628s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9426.57s">And</a> the assessment may tell us that that's okay, right like we that's what we don't that's all of the unknown that I was, I'm hoping that we can address so the, the owners project manager who was just here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9440.797s">We,</a> I have been sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9443.317s">telling</a> them that this may come their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9445.88s">It</a> is part of the scope of what they are signed up to do with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9450.424s">So</a> I think we do have a funding question that we need to answer hopefully in January when we talk about the supplemental budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9456.791s">But</a> they are aware that this could be coming and that it would be a pretty, you know, there would be a need for something quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9465.42s">quick</a> action to be taken in order to be able to write the statement of interest, get it approved and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9473.986s">So</a> there are a lot of steps and it's lightning fast, but if we choose not to move lightning fast right now, we're two years out before we can entertain that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9484.094s">So</a> that's why that one is listed as recommend proceeding in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9491.447s">The</a> network closet mini splits, which is the next item that TBD has also come in in the last three, four hours, 118,000 for those three outside schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9502.276s">The</a> recommendation to do that right now is because we cannot afford to melt all of our technical infrastructure in those buildings, which is a real risk given where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9515.066s">118</a> for the three, yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9529.985s">It's</a> more than $118,000.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9535.189s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9536.69s">The</a> next thing on the list is the freight elevator motor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9540.893s">So</a> the freight elevator is not working right now, and the motoring control needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9545.456s">at</a> Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9546.817s">So</a> we are recommending proceeding with that because I know it's a Medford High project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9552.302s">It</a> is only $25,000, but more importantly, I don't believe the building can be without a working freight elevator for the next four to six years while we wait for a bigger solution at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9565.492s">So</a> that is sort of the place that we're at with Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9569.135s">It's</a> like we'll continue to have these conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9573.078s">Can</a> it wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9573.719s">Can</a> it not wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9574.86s">And</a> that's, again, why I try not to run things to end of life quite this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9580.964s">But</a> we're just going to have to navigate that as it goes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9599.379s">Do</a> not last centuries, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9602.524s">The</a> next thing on the list is drainage at the Brooks Fields, which is $22,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9606.828s">There's</a> some curbing that needs to be addressed and an expansion of the French drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9615.378s">So,</a> when the turf field was put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9619.602s">I</a> was on the PTO there at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9622.164s">And</a> we were promised that the drainage would be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9627.547s">And</a> because now that it has not been addressed, the runoff from the hill in the front of the school runs off onto the new turf and is going to cause maintenance issues there at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9640.096s">So</a> it's a little bit unclear to me why that was not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9644.299s">But</a> we know now that it's $22,500, roughly give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9649.862s">I</a> think at one time, there was an idea that maybe the DPW could get to it, but this is a quote from, I think, I believe the same company that did the turf installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9661.608s">So</a> that is on the recommend proceeding in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9666.531s">District-wide</a> keyless locks and key fobs is also on the recommend proceeding in FY25, and <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9676.897s">to</a> move forward with that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9679.318s">It's</a> about $260,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9680.738s">And</a> what that would allow is keyless locks and employee FOB access for three to five doors at most schools, cameras and intercoms that are at select entry points to coincide, including three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Missituk, two at the Andrews, two at the McGlynn Elementary and Middle, and three at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9701.146s">And</a> so that so I know we've gone through this whole process of changing sort of the keying of buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9708.609s">This</a> move for $260,000 would move to a completely electronic key fob system and provide, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9719.702s">more</a> controlled access, less risk of losing a key, and sort of more modern approach to that kind of issuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9731.371s">So</a> I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9731.952s">Any</a> questions about the things we're recommending proceeding for FY25? <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9738.228s">Okay,</a> the next one is still a TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9742.41s">It's</a> recommend proceeding and FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9745.472s">The</a> cost is still TBD, but all of the door sweeps and dumpsters need to be addressed so that we can get a better handle on our like pest control situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9757.839s">And</a> if you've ever walked by one of the dumpsters, they smell horrendously bad if it's not like sub zero out. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9765.484s">So</a> there is some work to be done there to figure out exactly how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9769.99s">And</a> actually, I was in a conversation with Director Hunt about whether there's a better alternative to how we have our dumpsters, like we own them now, which means we own all of the stink in them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9783.486s">And</a> in modern times, people lease these things for a reason from a maintenance perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9789.607s">So</a> she was going to look into the new contract with lease management and whether there was something to change there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9795.609s">So</a> not thinking that'll get done this year, but it does need to be done soon in order to prevent problems in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9808.131s">The</a> front plaza settling remediation, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9813.823s">an</a> ADA compliance at McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9818.526s">As</a> I understand it, there's a potential grant that could at least partially pay for this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9827.052s">We</a> in 2022 attempted to submit and the submission was unsuccessful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9837.019s">The</a> city's <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9839.272s">DEI</a> director had a similar experience last year and <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9846.292s">What</a> we are recommending is that we work with our state delegation to figure out why this is so complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9855.838s">But</a> it sounds like all the brightest minds are saying this is a really complicated submission to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9862.903s">And</a> it's a huge challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9865.345s">So</a> our recommendation is that we successfully submit this grant request this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9870.648s">And</a> otherwise, we will have to do this work <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9877.273s">As</a> Dr. Cushing was stating, A, because we should, but B, because the cost of the project is so significant that we will have to do that in order to proceed with the HVAC project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9892.27s">I</a> will reach out to our state delegation and see if there isn't something they can do to help with the submission process so that we have a good or a better sense of timing and how to make a successful submission than we did in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9908.799s">And</a> so that's at McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9912.02s">And</a> that's like a twofold line. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9914.001s">So</a> there's $46,000 for the design, and then probably $300,000 to $500,000 to actually remediate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9916.982s">Questions</a> about any of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9928.345s">Okay,</a> district wide security updates is the next on the list that is listed at 1.5 and FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9937.234s">So</a> this is cameras, vape sensors, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9941.598s">There's</a> no action for us to take at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9943.82s">But</a> that's something to look at in the FY 26 budgeting process and to see if there's anything that we can do there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9949.486s">And</a> then if you flip over, <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9952.23s">We'll</a> take it home. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9954.332s">There's</a> three playground renovations on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9956.373s">So</a> I think we all are just absolutely in love with the work that was done at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9962.718s">It's</a> a beautiful playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9964.48s">It's</a> accessible in a way that none of our other playgrounds are. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9968.142s">All</a> of our buildings house students who need more accessible play spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9973.447s">And</a> all of those playgrounds are at end of life in one way, shape, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9978.59s">In</a> all three of those instances, certainly we can put in an open space application with CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9986.717s">As</a> a committee, what we did sort of get to is that our priority playground would be the Roberts of the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9997.532s">with</a> a caveat that we need to address the space issues at the Roberts in a bigger picture kind of way as a priority if we're going to make way to do an application with the CPC for a playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10014.815s">So</a> the playground redesign should not be undertaken without addressing first the broader space issues in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10020.577s">So</a> we heard from the teachers earlier this year <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10023.337s">that</a> the building is busting at the seams. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10026.279s">We</a> know that that is a problem and everyone's watching kindergarten enrollment very carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10032.483s">But</a> even if those things sort of weren't true, the space, the footprint of that building is incredibly small and confined. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10042.79s">So</a> we didn't come up with any like magical solutions there in terms of what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10047.974s">We</a> did have a good discussion about maybe creative alternatives, but <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10053.277s">The</a> space as it exists right now is just not sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10058.22s">The</a> teachers have to park each other in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10060.201s">That's</a> a huge no-no from a fire safety perspective, I would imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10065.463s">But</a> there's any number of reasons why there's just simply not enough space there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10070.646s">at</a> some point as we go forward and before we ask to invest the city's money in the playground there, there's some other sort of bigger picture things that we have to sort of grapple with and tackle with that building in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10087.336s">But</a> it's on the list as is the playground at Missittuck and Brooks so that at some point in time, we can talk about like when is the right time for those things to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10102.698s">parking</a> lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10106.501s">We</a> are saying it's not committed at this time, but to give you a sense of what that will cost, it's about $1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10115.109s">And</a> then the rest of these things, again, are not committed at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10118.532s">And</a> the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10122.935s">both</a> the cost and the urgency of some of these things are things that will come into focus if we're able to do this like mini commissioning which would be the district wide electrification enablement assessment that we talked about as well as the roof a roof rebuilder replacement at Brooks, Mistletoe and Roberts as well as the HVAC maintenance or replacement at Brooks, Mistletoe, Mistletoe and Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10146.491s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10147.572s">Those</a> numbers may move around dramatically if we find that one is in really good shape and one is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10154.359s">But</a> just to say, we know that they're all the same age. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10158.783s">They're</a> approaching end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10161.546s">So</a> they're on the radar from a planning perspective for us and for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10167.372s">Okay,</a> that's everything on the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10170.073s">Any</a> other questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10197.781s">So</a> I do think we need to do two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10200.342s">We</a> need to approve this, which will, I think the recommendation to approve should include that we'll pass this to Mr. McHugh so it can be contemplated in the supplemental budget so that we have some clarity once he comes before us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=10218.107s">And</a> then we also have to take off the table the approval of the HVAC project now that we're done with this.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=593.543s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU/2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU.html">12.2.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=224.842s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6778.394s">Um,</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6779.956s">One</a> is I just want to point out that the only thing that's posted on the agenda is the approval of the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6784.88s">So</a> I think we could approve the minutes and put that resolution on for discussion next week, which I think would be fine and maybe the dates need to would need to be adjusted on the floor, but I think we could totally do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6799.173s">Um,</a> the second is, um, I haven't had a chance to watch the subcommittee meeting, but I would like to, because I, when I looked at that initial list of things, my, my immediate reaction was that it was not appropriate for the district to be terping some of those things to the director at the city, that those are capacities we should have as a district in our current central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6823.009s">Um,</a> and then there's like this other part of what it takes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6829.213s">do</a> this work with like integrity and fidelity that does require dedicated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6836.335s">So</a> I would be really interested to see that job description, but I would be fine if we just sort of pushed all of that discussion to next week so that it can be properly posted in case anybody does want to come and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6848.459s">I</a> think Director Nwaje is great, but I also think like taking a slice of somebody's already full job, like there's hundreds of employees in the city and they probably could all benefit from the work she does in a dedicated fashion without having to be sort of side supporting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6863.673s">And</a> I would like for us to have that conversation because I think there's all kinds of things that <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6869.878s">we</a> should be doing and we aren't and it's it's not about like you know a non-interest in collaboration because I think the only way this works is if you put somebody in the role in a dedicated fashion inside of the organization and then they work with the director at the city because cross-collaboration in this space everything's always changing <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6893.195s">it's</a> really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6895.257s">But</a> how it gets like actually implemented and executed can be quite different. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6898.54s">So</a> I'm totally on board with having that discussion at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6904.045s">And</a> I think we could have that discussion in part next week or in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6908.949s">And</a> then we can have it again from a funding perspective in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6912.833s">And</a> I think for me, that's a fine timeline and it reflects sort of the urgency <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6918.037s">Um</a> but I don't think we have to necessarily decide that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6922.139s">We</a> could just we could just approve the minutes and put that on for next week for like a fuller discussion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6934.725s">Um</a> motion to approve the minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6952.354s">Hi,</a> I will be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6955.555s">We</a> have held two meetings to put together a recommendation that'll come before this, this committee in a couple of weeks at our special meeting that'll be held on December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6967.898s">Um</a> so I don't think we need to go into a lot of details here but thanks to the committee, thanks to some of the folks from the city who joined us to weigh in on particularly the HVAC project at McGlynn and Andrews as well as the conversations that I've been able to have with the OPM and others that are involved in that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6985.651s">We</a> have a whole meeting dedicated to this coming up next week that we will use to sort of finalize this and then that will feed into the ongoing budget discussion from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6996.076s">So</a> just make a motion to approve the minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9493.72s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9494.42s">Can</a> you just clarify for me, when you say that we finally have somebody who is able to clean the bathrooms, how many custodians are on the day shift at Medford High?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9525.734s">So</a> I know the seventh person was a new position that we added, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9535.097s">But</a> why can't we clean the bathrooms more if we have seven people on staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9543.39s">who</a> are there to keep the building clean.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9610.365s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9611.186s">So</a> I don't see anything in here about opening more bathrooms per se, which I am in support of all the ways that you're proposing to spend the capital funding that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9631.152s">And</a> I would be happy to make a motion tonight, but how do we open more bathrooms?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9682.768s">And</a> then why are the bathrooms in the B building never open?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9770.525s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9771.326s">So</a> essentially, if we had two more staff members, you could open how many more bathrooms?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9798.511s">And</a> what if you only had one staff member?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9812.001s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9812.52s">That's</a> helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9814.441s">And</a> then, Dr. Cushing, you said something that I think was polite in terms of what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9823.323s">Students</a> are flushing vapes and causing plumbing damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9827.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9827.985s">That</a> is very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9829.485s">Is</a> that what you were saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9945.142s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9945.882s">And</a> I think one request I have is that if you are talking to parents about their students vaping, that you're making them aware of the real cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9956.687s">Like</a> every time we spend X dollars on plumbing, it's money that we are not able to spend on students. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9964.031s">doing</a> something that will help them get an education, and I think we need to quantify that both for students and for parents, so that people can start to understand the consequences of the actions and decisions that they're making. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9976.783s">To</a> your point, like being willing to take care of your community is important, but there's also a <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9983.649s">very</a> practical dollars and cents component of all of this, which is we can't just decide not to fix the plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9991.835s">We</a> have to fix the plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=9993.255s">So</a> that means we will have to decide not to do something else.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10021.354s">And</a> can we just be really clear and transparent about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10025.416s">This</a> bathroom is closed because of a plumbing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10030.699s">Yeah,</a> again, it's hard to help everybody make good decisions all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10037.162s">But</a> when you can see in real consequence what's happening to your classmates, hopefully that will deter some folks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10049.224s">So</a> what you are asking for in this proposal is essentially approval to proceed with the vape sensors, the grout cleaning machine and the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10064.089s">out</a> of the capital funds that have been allocated for bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10068.773s">And</a> then two additional staff members, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10079.682s">Sure,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10080.323s">But</a> I just wanna make sure I'm understanding, like, what are you asking us to think about spending, but not necessarily tonight, but what is- I mean, thinking about spending the 94.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10160.946s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10162.206s">I</a> have a couple of motions, but I will let everybody else ask their questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10166.828s">And</a> I think there's probably some folks online who may want to speak as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10899.173s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10901.459s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10902.859s">Can</a> we make sure that all the people involved who might be responsible for holding a key or fielding a question have clear talking points about how to describe what bathrooms are open at any given time? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10920.139s">It</a> seems to me like I'll call it a training issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10922.341s">I</a> don't think that's exactly the right word, but there's a communication issue being perpetuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10927.828s">That</a> sounds very legitimate and fixable. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10931.613s">If</a> we can make sure that we have some conversation with those key staff so that they <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10938.718s">know</a> what's happening day-to-day, first of all, and second of all, if they are supposed to have a key, that they have a key. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10946.32s">I</a> know we have heard lots of things about the re-keying of our buildings from a security standpoint, and I hope that's not what's being sort of perpetuated here, but I just want to make sure that the people who can provide access to students for the bathrooms in that central space know that they are allowed to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11025.46s">Yeah,</a> yeah I think for sure they are some of the most helpful people in your building, and I'm sure they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11033.147s">they're</a> not wanting to not be helpful, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11036.288s">So</a> I think we just need to make sure we're giving them the information that they need to be helpful when students are asking them, whether it's the main office or the AP's office or the guidance office, like all of those places are places that I could see students actively going to to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11051.514s">where</a> do I go, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11053.495s">So</a> that I think is really important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11055.436s">So</a> if you could handle that communication piece, I think that would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11059.578s">I'm</a> excited to hear that you have a plan to open bathrooms on the CTE side of the building because that is actually the longest walk you could imagine in the building if you have to go from there to all the way to C. And I'm finally like learning the building, so I'm really proud of myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11076.405s">I</a> don't always get lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11077.605s">It's</a> like half the time I get lost now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11079.706s">Um,</a> but, um, I would also like to make a motion to approve the proposal to use the capital funds for the halo vape dispensers, the grout cleaning machine and the cameras.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11100.716s">And</a> then I would also like to make a motion that you all <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11106.141s">put</a> forward for consideration in the supplemental budget what the staffing complement would look like so that that can be an option we consider in the supplemental budget come the first meeting of January.<h2><a href="../2024-11-27_qorztDP2QHI/2024-11-27_qorztDP2QHI.html">Strategic & Capital Planning SubCommittee</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=115.855s">And</a> member Graham, I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=117.376s">So</a> three present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=121.498s">So</a> as I mentioned, this is a continuation of our first subcommittee meeting that we held back on 10-15. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=131.645s">And</a> the goal of these two meetings is to sort of put together and formalize <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=138.364s">a</a> view of our capital plan for the schools and think about what kind of recommendations we want to make to the broader school committee, which will happen at a meeting in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=151.034s">I</a> think it's the 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=153.957s">And</a> I see that we have a couple of guests joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=156.118s">So</a> we have Alicia Hunt from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and we have Paul Riggi from the City's Facility Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=163.964s">So</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=164.805s">Thank</a> you for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=166.813s">Um,</a> I'm actually hopeful this meeting will not take an hour and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=170.335s">Um,</a> but we, this is the first time we've done this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=173.816s">So</a> we tried to make sure that we had enough space in the schedule to do all the things that we needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=180.879s">Um,</a> so I'm going to bring up, um, the capital plan that we worked through last time and just provide a little bit of context for those of you who are, um, newer to, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=194.308s">the</a> conversation just as soon as I can find the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=196.509s">Here</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=199.93s">And</a> this capital plan, the way that we created this is we started with last year's capital plan, which was created in a meeting as like a starting point back in like May or June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=219.255s">And</a> then from there, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=223.106s">Peter</a> did solicit input from the building principals to say what other capital needs exist in the district that we may or may not have on our radar in terms of things that we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=239.702s">That's</a> how this list has come to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=243.245s">One</a> of the things we talked a lot about in the last meeting was, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=248.433s">sort</a> of this intersection of a whole bunch of work happening at McGlynn and Andrews that this committee is aware of and apprised of. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=259.16s">And</a> sort of how does that play into the overall capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=264.864s">And</a> I actually met yesterday with Director Hunt and Dr. Cushing and the OPM for the project to try to get some clarity around <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=277.048s">Some</a> of the work that's going on and just sort of having some discussion and we, we sort of did this when we met last time there was some question about like what's included in that project and what is excluded from that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=291.802s">I</a> think some of that has come into focus a little bit more, or at least we have sort of a directional focus that can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=299.623s">And</a> the other thing that we talked about with the OPM was sort of the timeline to prepare to keep the project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=309.046s">And</a> we asked the OPM also to be available to join us at our committee of the whole meeting, which actually will become a special school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=323.41s">Just</a> to give us an update on the project itself, but I can I'm happy to relay sort of what we talked about yesterday in terms of, like, you know, sort of things that are lumped into this and things that are excluded from this so that we can revise this capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=339.359s">Because</a> that's, like, the biggest block of things that are in process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=342.74s">So</a> in scope is the. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=347.623s">the</a> piece that we think about as HVAC right for both schools McGlynn and Andrews so that's in scope there's not been a question about that but a couple of other things that we talked about and confirmed yesterday as directionally sort of where we're going <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=373.55s">To</a> include includes both the roof rebuild in some fashion at the McGlynn and the network splits and the many splits that are in the network closets in those two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=394.24s">So</a> that's what these two rows are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=396.342s">And</a> I'm just going to move them up here because this is up here is stuff that we're saying is in progress and funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=403.863s">And</a> all of these things sort of are bundled into the... <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=413.424s">project</a> at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=415.385s">And</a> what that is going to allow is for the OPM to actually, because we have sort of like a chicken and egg situation going on, where we say, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=425.39s">Well,</a> it depends on how much it costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=426.591s">Well,</a> it depends on what's included. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=428.331s">Well,</a> it depends on how much it costs, which is sort of very typical at this point in these kinds of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=435.595s">But</a> what we talked about yesterday was that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=440.345s">We</a> are proceeding as though a bond will need to be issued by the city for this project and that it will include these components and solar for the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=455.057s">And</a> that will enable the OPM to actually go put that package together with pricing so that then we can look at that comprehensively and say, okay, yes, that is the go forward plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=471.164s">And</a> yes, that is the funding mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=475.518s">In</a> order to, the other thing we talked a little bit about as a group was in order to keep this project on track so that it can be completed before the next school year, there is a tiny window that we've got to get exactly right between now and February. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=495.103s">So</a> if you all recall, at the last school committee meeting, we took a vote to authorize the mayor to enter into a CM at risk contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=504.926s">And</a> Paul and Alicia, feel free to jump in if I get this wrong, but what that allows us to do is bring the construction manager into the project sooner than we might otherwise do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=516.812s">And</a> that allows them to do things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=521.014s">Get</a> the equipment purchased that we are going to need that has long wait times while we wait for like the final design to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=528.718s">So</a> the timeline that we talked about yesterday was that really in order to keep on track, we need to be in a position to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=539.242s">the</a> CM contract startup costs and the equipment costs in the month of January, which does mean that all of this question about funding and bonding has to make its way through the process between now and then, which does include an appearance at the council meeting, then an advertisement, and then a second appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=559.48s">Is</a> that right, Alicia? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=564.224s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=565.105s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=566.326s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=568.862s">And</a> there's many more steps than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=573.406s">That's</a> like a grossly simplified version of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=576.549s">But</a> what we did ask the OPM to do was to be prepared to come to our special meeting on the 11th to give us an update on the project, and particularly that timeline of what needs to happen, what do they need from us, do they need from the city side, et cetera, to make sure that the project stays on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=597.956s">And</a> that's the McGlynn project in a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=613.086s">Any</a> questions about that one, Erica?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=632.731s">Yeah,</a> the OPM is under contract and being paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=636.812s">And</a> I believe that is coming out of ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=640.893s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=642.253s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=643.734s">And</a> then all of the rest of the costs, we have to bond in order to have the money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=649.255s">So</a> that's why the bonding process is so important timeline-wise, because if we can't get those things in place in January, it's going to push the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=661.038s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=662.165s">back</a> and then we're going to be, you know, back at, you know, in impeding on the start of school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=680.448s">Um,</a> also includes roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=688.63s">So</a> we'll go back to the end network. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=698.01s">Okay,</a> so in terms of in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=703.475s">Progress</a> process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=709.16s">Activities</a> those are that's sort of 1 big block. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=713.044s">Of</a> activity does that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=716.281s">and</a> we would consider all of those together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=717.902s">So</a> I'm putting that above the funding line, although obviously there's still a lot of work to do to secure all the right approvals, et cetera, for the bond, but that's sort of where we're at with that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=742.523s">Yeah,</a> and the school committee, actually, we won't vote on the funding piece of it because it is bonded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=751.81s">So</a> the city is the only authority that can take out the bond.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=761.458s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=766.522s">So</a> the other, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=770.305s">The</a> other thing that we did talk about that I think is really important, um, is we talked with the OPM about these, um, recommissioning assessments and that that's like another place where, um, broadly speaking, the OPM is on board to do those things, but funding has been such that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=796.596s">There's</a> not clarity about when we wanted to do that because we didn't tell them and we didn't tell them because we didn't have money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=803.639s">So</a> that's 1 thing that I think we can sort of start to clear up what. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=809.921s">We</a> talked about yesterday in addition is that is opening up an accelerated repair window, like, usually between usually, like, between January and. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=821.485s">Maybe</a> April, March, April, and that accelerated repairs for things like roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=827.63s">Boilers</a> HVAC, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=832.453s">MSP</a> has adopted a new process where they'll open up a window this coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=838.057s">January</a> to June or January to April, and then they will do it every other year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=843.862s">And</a> so if you hop into the window this year in January, you would learn if you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=850.461s">were</a> able to <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=854.229s">be</a> funded sometime like around now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=857.53s">So</a> it is a long process to get the notification to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=864.233s">But</a> if we are interested in doing that, we have to either get in this year or it's two more years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=875.738s">So</a> it would be January 2027 before we would have another <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=883.781s">Go</a> at it, I did talk to last week and they did confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=890.068s">Yes,</a> districts who are in the core program can apply for accelerated repair projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=898.277s">Um,</a> so I think, um, what probably makes sense is for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=903.66s">Um,</a> re, commissioning assessment line to sort of split into. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=909.223s">To</a> maybe 2 lines 1 is a mini assessment that would enable us to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=915.567s">if</a> we need to take advantage of that accelerated repair program so that assessment could get us ready to submit for brooks roberts and missittuck if we find that the needs there are pressing and urgent when we talk about roofs and hvac um so what we may want to consider recommending to the committee is that we pursue a mini assessment that <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=944.341s">looks</a> at those pieces that are eligible for accelerated repair in an effort to put forward an application in that program this year if we qualify but we don't know yet so the thought the thought that we batted around yesterday was let's try to <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=967.611s">do</a> some sort of mini assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=970.072s">The</a> OPM is going to figure out what the cost of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=973.532s">And</a> based on that mini assessment, it will inform our ability to go into this accelerated repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=979.213s">And</a> then once we have clarity on that, then we can circle back around to the sort of like regular routine recommissioning projects into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=991.676s">But</a> that would get us sort of on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=995.977s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1001.889s">Any</a> questions about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1021.058s">He</a> was going to give us the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1022.578s">So</a> once I get that, I will fill that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1029.966s">But</a> I think, um, one thing we may want to do is identify this as like a thing that we are recommending that we take up urgently. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1038.814s">Um,</a> so in the project status, there may be some things where we say, we're recommending that we do this in FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1048.462s">Um,</a> and then we can have that discussion with the committee and make sure that they agree with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1054.287s">I</a> don't know what you all think about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1097.937s">Yeah,</a> I think it's usually a portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1099.618s">I</a> don't, I don't think it's full funding, but it is a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1102.84s">Okay,</a> and then the other idea that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1113.513s">I</a> had is that we at some point talk about, um, with the OPM, this idea of a district wide electrification enablement assessment and where that might fit and whether that is in the scope of their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1130.181s">Um,</a> and we did not do that yesterday because we had sort of a full plate, but, um, I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1137.998s">think</a> we necessarily need to recommend that we proceed with that in FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1144.786s">But</a> that could be something that we circle back to with the OPM, who obviously is getting to know our buildings intimately and would be in probably a decent position to be able to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1172.752s">That's</a> a great question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1272.976s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1273.356s">Okay,</a> so I think the other question, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1283.239s">Is</a> around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1288.888s">Let</a> me just move this down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1299.711s">Any</a> of these other projects that we are suggesting that we are recommending proceeding with in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1310.013s">Last</a> time we met, we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1317.489s">the</a> five-pump control in the McGlynn, the failed flashing behind the brick facade, and the freight motor elevator as being like, and the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation being urgent types of projects that we should consider recommending that the school committee look for funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1346.994s">Um,</a> I don't know if you all have any thoughts about that in terms of, like, which ones we should be recommending.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1391.235s">Did</a> we lose you?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1472.195s">If</a> the CPC has been amenable to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1476.345s">project</a> and we think that that's a good thing to at least try to leverage the CPC funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1486.232s">Maybe</a> that's what we recommend to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1490.035s">Questions,</a> thoughts, Erica, Paul?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1620.788s">Can</a> I just ask you a question about that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1623.689s">Is</a> that assuming DPW has the capacity to do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1628.152s">Or</a> that somebody else is doing it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1647.761s">And</a> so the front Plaza, we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1651.889s">Somewhere</a> between 300,000 and 550,000 between design and construction, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1655.531s">Yes,</a> I think the higher number came in at 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1657.092s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1700.256s">Director</a> Hunt, while we have you here, the issue is both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, the front plaza is settling and causing an ADA issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1711.495s">Are</a> there <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1717.29s">Other</a> funding sources besides just city cash that we should be considering here from a grant perspective or particularly because of the ADA aspects of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1849.875s">So</a> it was taken on the city side, but ultimately not successful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1855.196s">In</a> submission.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1857.717s">And</a> so when you say we're gonna have to do it again this year, who do you mean is going to do it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1883.549s">Like,</a> is this something Francis is doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1886.03s">Is</a> this something we are doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1887.331s">Like,</a> who's doing this reaching out part?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1907.495s">If</a> something's fall crashing my house, not sure what it is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2005.049s">And</a> Dr. Cushing, when you say we need to work with the state partners, who are they?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2016.756s">Is</a> it <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2017.719s">a</a> commonwealth office or is it yes it is a common nope it's commonwealth office um do you think it would be helpful to reach out to our state delegation to ask for their assistance or alicia do you have thoughts on how to navigate this i know we haven't given you really any information so
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2278.729s">I'm</a> going to suggest that <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2283.855s">Our</a> recommendation to the committee is that we successfully, for the first time, submit this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2291.699s">And</a> that meanwhile, I'm going to send a note to our state delegation asking for their assistance in how they can help get this moving in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2304.806s">Dr.</a> Edward Benson?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2343.228s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2345.169s">Um,</a> I will send a note to reach out to him if the, if this group and then ultimately the committee is agreeable that the recommendation is we should submit a grant this year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2375.911s">So</a> let's see if we can't move that along grant-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2382.357s">And</a> if not, that may need to be a request.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2408.376s">It</a> means it rains inside the kindergarten when there's a driving sideways wind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2456.942s">How</a> is the flashing on the brick related to the roof?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2483.903s">The</a> flashing issue behind the brick is not at the roof line, is it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2501.363s">Alicia,</a> have you all talked about that piece of that at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2506.248s">Or</a> should we ask Tom about potential integration of that into the bigger project?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2556.64s">We</a> already know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2561.203s">We</a> did a water infiltration test.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2641.554s">Well,</a> we already have done that for this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2645.574s">We</a> just haven't funded it to actually fix it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2869.252s">Okay,</a> so I can get a note to the, we can get a note to the about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2875.737s">This</a> piece, so that there's at least an opportunity to talk about whether inclusion in the project is an economy of scale or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2884.604s">But</a> also. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2888.147s">We</a> can talk to them about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2891.952s">Whether</a> there's an opportunity to advance this work ahead of the rest of the work, because it is its own separate little roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2900.158s">That</a> is not the same as, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2904.221s">The</a> bigger roof project, so we can get that information and integrate it before the special meeting that we have.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3023.792s">Um,</a> did you also get a price for the dump the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3059.264s">When</a> you get those numbers, can we, can you let me know and I'll update this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3066.209s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3066.49s">Okay,</a> so we have some items here, the network closet mini splits for Brooks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3078.599s">Duck-Roberts</a> and Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3084.344s">We</a> were, Dr. Cushing, you were in the process of <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3088.991s">parsing</a> out that estimate of like McGlynn Andrews versus everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3093.252s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3098.554s">And</a> can you help us understand like how, um, urgent is this need at Brooks Roberts, Mississauga, Medford High?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3259.977s">And</a> are you suggesting that we need to prioritize this in FY25 or that we should prioritize this for FY26?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3293.546s">So</a> 25, does that recommend proceeding in FY 25 is the recommendation? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3299.351s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3302.634s">Then</a> we have the fire pump control at the McGlynn Elementary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3315.842s">I'm</a> going to say it's complete then. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3318.063s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3339.958s">And</a> the 1st thing in a new tab is what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3349.368s">Yeah,</a> project status complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3351.01s">Instead</a> of in progress excellent news. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3356.495s">Okay,</a> we have the freight elevator motor at Medford high.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3438.072s">And</a> is this member and member so a recommendation for twenty five.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3470.666s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3472.247s">And</a> the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation, are we putting that in a recommend proceeding in 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3485.802s">category?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3510.675s">I'm</a> going to ask if you could remind us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3681.376s">Oh,</a> what I wrote was recommend proceeding in FY 26 potential <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3691.664s">From</a> the operating budget, because I think realistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3698.128s">It's</a> the end of the year and that's why 25 ends in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3702.911s">And</a> if we're going to boil the ocean between now and then, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3708.024s">realistically,</a> we're not going to get to doing a replacement of something like this until summer, which is already FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3715.725s">So</a> if the goal is like between now and then we like figure out what the right go forward plan is and whether that's capital or, or budget or whatever, it's, I think what I'm hearing is it's FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3733.608s">Do</a> you guys agree with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3735.869s">Yes,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3737.249s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3740.049s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3740.489s">And</a> then drainage at the field for the Brooks.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3750.696s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3751.297s">That's</a> a very long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3755.039s">My</a> kids are going to graduate before it gets fixed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3772.813s">So</a> it's just a funding issue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3796.849s">We</a> should be able to... This isn't under the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3800.411s">It's</a> on the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3803.372s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3804.113s">That,</a> like, essentially dumps runoff onto the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3809.576s">But</a> it's because the hill is not properly drained, so the field shouldn't be impacted by the work, I would think.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3824.143s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3837.788s">Yeah,</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3841.571s">And</a> then these items, the other things on the list here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3848.536s">are</a> all, uh, this whole group, I think I would suggest that we leave them as not committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3854.179s">So</a> there are things we have to plan for in the future, but the mini assessment is going to tell us what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3865.405s">Um,</a> so ready to support taking any like urgent, immediate action in terms of funding, but we should leave them on the plan because they are upcoming needs that we know we're going to need to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3879.148s">Um,</a> the other remaining items on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3883.693s">With</a> district wide security upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3887.758s">And</a> then we have playground renovations also that are, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3893.704s">You</a> know, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3895.629s">They're</a> not like urgent things are falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3899.152s">But</a> they were also noted in our last meeting as things we could possibly talk to the CPC about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3905.779s">And</a> then the last thing is the parking lot paving.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4104.073s">So,</a> members, so are there 3 parts keyless locks intercom.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4159.301s">I'm</a> sorry, it's $260,000 for three to five doors and employee fobs, or it's $260,000 for all of that plus the camera intercom buzzer system.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4198.797s">Let</a> me make sure I have this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4200.518s">Keyless</a> locks and employee bobs, three to five doors at most schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4207.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4208.082s">And</a> then the camera intercom system. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4211.845s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4218.848s">For</a> select entry points <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4224.642s">including</a> three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Missituk, three at the McGlynn, two at the Andrews.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4273.081s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4273.541s">And</a> so all of that is 260.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4299.461s">And</a> so what is the remainder of the 1.9?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4347.234s">And</a> that's the one, really 1.7.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4364.414s">And</a> the other thing that was in this before was network phone availability in Medford High classrooms.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4404.031s">And</a> there's no capital dollars needed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4417.934s">That's</a> amazing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4436.005s">But</a> the district security updates, if I leave that at 1.7 and then the key lock, the locks and the fobs and the camera buzzer systems as a separate line item for 260, does that sound right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4586.95s">So</a> I guess what I'm thinking about when I say recommend proceeding in FY 25 is that <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4597.136s">What</a> I am thinking about as we are talking is that in December, when we take a vote, the vote is really for the administration to consider these projects as part of the supplemental budget requests they're going to bring forward in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4619.146s">And</a> then if there is something that can't be funded that we said, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4624.838s">doing</a> 25 and it can't be funded through the supplemental budget, then that has to go before the council for additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4636.304s">But</a> I think the first step is like this should give some clarity to our budget director to say these are the projects that we are thinking are very important and we want to see you weigh in on when you bring the supplemental budget forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4649.772s">Does</a> that make sense to everybody?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4696.95s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4704.651s">So,</a> the things that we still have as not committed are the district wide security updates for 1.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4714.318s">We</a> did have those like, but that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4721.607s">saying</a> anything more than that just yet about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4726.53s">And</a> maybe that's a good conversation for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4730.592s">The</a> other question I had was around playground renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4734.154s">So</a> we are mostly done with the playground renovation at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4740.878s">And</a> it's stunning and spectacular and gorgeous. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4746.601s">And</a> it was a very long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4750.222s">to</a> do the design work to make it such a special project in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4756.104s">So</a> I guess I'm curious, we sort of have on the radar that all of our playgrounds are going to need to be replaced at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4765.187s">Is</a> there a timing of when we might seek CPC funding for another playground? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4776.731s">And</a> I believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4779.887s">Part</a> of the reason we are having this conversation right now is because the CPC window opens after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4789.03s">So</a> if we were going to recommend that we put forward a project for this upcoming cycle, we would have to identify which project that would be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5276.354s">What</a> Alicia, since you're here, have there been discussions about this that this group is not privy to or aware of on the city side? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5288.663s">Every</a> time I go there, I'm like, what is that building across the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5293.567s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5295.068s">I</a> actually don't know what it is, but I wonder about it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5300.28s">For</a> many reasons, I dream about an after school center and a parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5304.782s">Mostly,</a> I don't, I have no, I have no sense of what happens in that building or. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5309.723s">Or</a> who owns it, but I just didn't know if there had been any conversations about what a space problem we do have at at that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5320.426s">That</a> building is busting at the seams and, like, we cannot go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5323.907s">Like,</a> we, we have, so that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5327.119s">a</a> separate but related problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5330.62s">But</a> the signs are that there's continued high demand for elementary school students in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5338.581s">So</a> I would agree that I think the Roberts does need to be first on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5346.583s">But</a> we need a double-decker playground or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5352.884s">Something</a> has to give there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5356.079s">And</a> I'm not exactly sure what it is or where to put that in the conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5568.347s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5816.206s">So</a> I think what I'm hearing is what we would recommend is that we prioritize a solution at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5830.902s">We're</a> not ready necessarily to ask the CPC for money because we don't actually know the solution could possibly be at this moment, but that what we do recommend is that there are some continuing conversations about what those possibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5851.009s">I</a> mean, I don't know, do we like every time I go there, I'm shocked that the staff park each other in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5859.114s">They</a> don't have a choice, but they park each other and it's super unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5862.816s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5863.216s">Like,</a> it's a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5865.638s">Like,</a> there's no other there's nothing else to do, but there's not enough parking for the number of staff that have to work in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5875.223s">And</a> there's not enough playground space, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5879.636s">Do</a> we need literally a parking deck or something that would double the parking capacity and create some space? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5887.861s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5888.981s">But</a> I think that's a question we'd need to talk to some people about in terms of what even the options are and maybe have a conversation with the folks across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5902.884s">before</a> we could proceed with the CPC application, but perhaps the, the recommendation from this group to the committee is that is our short range priority is like figuring something out for that building that leads to our ability to address the playground.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6041.49s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6041.65s">So</a> apparently I lied about how long this meeting was going to take.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6052.594s">This</a> was inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6058.402s">Shoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6073.285s">So</a> this is where we've landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6076.886s">So</a> for recommendations in 25, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6084.239s">The</a> mini reconditioning assessment, the network closets, the freight elevator, the drainage at the Brooksfield, the key fobs, the dumpster mitigation potentially in 26, and getting this grant addressed for the ADA issue at McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6108.523s">We're</a> saying district-wide security updates of 1.5, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6115.393s">are</a> not committed at this time, but from a planning perspective, we should be looking at it for FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6122.919s">The</a> Roberts is our priority playground or recommended priority playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6133.227s">Parking</a> lot paving also not committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6136.37s">Then</a> these items are all contingent on the mini-commissioning study and what might come from there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6170.425s">There</a> aren't as many students at the Brooks, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6177.401s">I</a> think that's the conversation for after we've solved all the rest.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6191.745s">Again,</a> I think there's lots of change to this before we get to that place on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6198.646s">So</a> is there anything else that you think we should change?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6229.957s">And</a> we're recommending this one, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6300.314s">Okay,</a> so I'm just going to put a little legend at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6303.396s">This</a> is what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6304.597s">This</a> is what we're saying if we say recommend proceeding in FY26. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6312.741s">If</a> we say recommend CPC funding request, MPS directs the administration to apply for CPC funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6331.375s">Um,</a> not needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6338.22s">No,</a> immediate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6352.05s">Action</a> required.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6401.567s">Yes,</a> I did talk to Jerry about that and he gave me the dollar thresholds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6411.175s">And</a> so I've been filling that in as we've been talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6421.552s">I'm</a> down somewhere.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6436.192s">I</a> think it's $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6438.393s">And</a> so if it's under $150,000, it can be included in that school spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6442.054s">If</a> it's over, it cannot be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6451.778s">Each</a> school, $150,000 per each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6454.119s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6455.8s">Or</a> per project, not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6458.609s">It's</a> per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6460.111s">It's</a> per project, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6462.894s">Yeah,</a> I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6464.877s">I</a> think these would be a no.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6512.947s">So</a> that's the other one we had that we need to describe and then <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6532.304s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6561.127s">So</a> that's like a little key for us for like what those project status. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6579.428s">Do</a> we have that we need to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6592.773s">I</a> think we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6618.228s">Any</a> other questions, thoughts, things we missed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6636.592s">And</a> we don't have to answer that question, which will come up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6651.59s">So</a> I think we have a couple of costs to include between now and the meeting, but I will probably put together a slide that says, here's what we did, and here's how we did it, and this is the result.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6691.165s">Yeah,</a> by December 6th would be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6702.065s">In</a> my mind, it's two weeks away, but it's not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6710.489s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6714.03s">So</a> I think what we need tonight is just a recommendation to send this to the full committee for their review. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6727.293s">And</a> then the other thing that, uh, we will need to do as a full committee is like, make a recommendation to approve this or approve it as amended, which will happen at the special meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6741.944s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6744.666s">So</a> we have a motion to, um, approve, approve this recommendation to send to the entire school committee by member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6754.274s">So</a> seconded by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6756.513s">So</a> I'll do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6757.233s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6759.675s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6760.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6761.335s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6761.996s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6762.856s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6765.657s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6775.522s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6776.522s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6777.683s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6778.563s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6779.204s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6779.584s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6781.845s">Thank</a> you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6785.347s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6786.94s">Paul,</a> Rigi, for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6789.602s">Paul,</a> I don't know your title, or I would have called you by your proper title. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6792.985s">But</a> thank you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6795.747s">Paul</a> is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6798.389s">Thank</a> you both for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6799.669s">It</a> was super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6802.171s">And</a> I will follow up with you all if there are action items for you or questions that we have in the meantime. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6808.376s">But</a> really appreciate your support.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4/2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4.html">11.18.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4326.783s">Remember</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4329.965s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4330.566s">So,</a> if I'm reading correctly and question one, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4336.03s">Back</a> away from my microphone a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4338.872s">What</a> I am understanding is that for before school, there's no waitlist to speak of, except at the Brooks, and we <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4355.197s">aren't</a> that far away from me being able to clear the before school wait lists, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4364.78s">And</a> for after school, the wait lists, the enrollment at, if I'm reading this correctly, the enrollment at the Brooks is decreasing, which we knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4377.984s">Enrollment</a> at the McGlynn has increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4383.944s">The</a> Missittuck enrollment has decreased slightly and the Roberts has stayed flat, roughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4390.245s">And</a> the wait list is quite small at McGlynn and Missittuck, pretty consistent at the Roberts and biggest at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4408.789s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4479.099s">And</a> Megan, can you tell us what is the difference for the Brooks under the wait list for afterschool? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4486.441s">127</a> parentheses 57.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4503.004s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4504.028s">Um,</a> that that is helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4506.15s">Um,</a> so can you I guess the other question that I have when I look at this piece of the puzzle is that I think I was under the impression that things would improve at McGlynn and Mississippi specifically because of city year and that does not seem to have been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4523.702s">So</a> can you talk a little bit about why? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4526.264s">Um,</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4649.858s">Thank</a> you for clarifying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4651.399s">I</a> feel like that's the opposite of our impression of the value that City Year was going to bring to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4657.742s">So</a> I'm really disappointed to hear that because part of the reason we made space in a really tight budget to be able to do this was to alleviate some of the real staffing issues that we have in the building and buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4675.351s">And</a> if we're not actually solving those problems, I would be interested to learn more about the value that the team is bringing to the table and whether it's justified for us to continue the partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4689.119s">So</a> I think that's not a question you can answer, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4692.541s">Fidler-Carey,</a> because that's a city year question, but just something that I think we should all be thinking about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4722.64s">Oh,</a> I thought it was the model so I would definitely like to know more about that because, you know, this is an annual expense and if we're going to spend money we need to make sure that we're getting what we thought we were getting from it and <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4738.468s">I</a> get that there's stuff that happens in a new relationship that you work out the kinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4743.71s">But</a> if the kinks are forever, then that limits the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4750.493s">So</a> we just need to sort that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4753.734s">I</a> guess the other thing that I know when we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4758.956s">need</a> the before school program is not the biggest need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4763.378s">It's</a> not the thing people email us about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4766.599s">But</a> I do think it strikes me as the most fixable problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4770.5s">Like</a> it strikes me as there's a handful of kids and there is space to be able to take in eight kids at the Brooks, one kid at Mississippi Tech and <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4780.444s">two</a> kids at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4781.785s">So</a> I would be interested to know from your perspective, like what would it take for us to be able to clear those before school wait lists? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4791.07s">And</a> how can we, how can, how can we help sort of push that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4869.11s">Yeah,</a> so I guess I'm wondering if perhaps working with Miss Bowen to identify what those students needs are and identify staff that may be a match and maybe put out some emails, letting the right people know that we are looking for somebody with a particular skill set. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4889.508s">who</a> might be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4890.488s">I</a> know it's only an hour in the morning, so there may be people willing to do it if we can be specific about what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=4900.371s">And</a> again, it's not the biggest problem that we have when it comes to the overall issue, but it is a fixable one, probably perhaps more fixable than the other issues, as far as I can tell.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6137.279s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6137.719s">Do</a> you have a number of buses that it would take for the Andrews to become viable?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6183.809s">So,</a> and presumably the students at the McGlynn wouldn't need a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6190.211s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6190.571s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6190.891s">So</a> three, that's right, three buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6194.412s">And</a> I think my question is 20, more than 20 kids fit on a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6201.451s">Is</a> it really three whole extra buses, or is there some lesser number of buses that would make this viable?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6260.29s">Yeah,</a> the reason I ask, I think it's worth figuring out what the real number is so that we are coming up on the end of our bus contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6269.558s">We're</a> going to make these kinds of asks and we're going to need to be like precise and specific about it because we don't have an endless amount of money for buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6280.046s">So</a> we need to know what all the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6282.288s">And</a> I think it sounds like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6287.62s">your</a> office probably has the data that we need there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6290.341s">So</a> I just like you to pull that together so that when the time comes, we have an answer that is a little bit more precise available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6299.265s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6302.106s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6303.687s">And</a> then the other comment I wanted to make is I have heard from parents repeatedly that <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6316.786s">Things</a> haven't gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6318.588s">I</a> think that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6322.031s">But</a> I think that the reason that they have gotten better is because of all of these outside organizations that have come to Medford right so our collective capacity has increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6334.577s">your</a> report doesn't necessarily show that and we didn't, I didn't ask for that so I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6342.046s">But</a> it does, you know, I think it would be useful, maybe even just to add some of those like the comments that you've shared with us tonight like this report can <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6354.773s">tell</a> us what the conclusions are and could talk about like how long has this program been in existence so that if we were to look at some consolidation of like all of our after school capacity in the city, what, what is it, and what is the like unmet need and there is still significant unmet need, but it's a different amount of unmet need than it was several years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6380.398s">In</a> the collective so I feel like that would be really powerful information to to sort of get right and frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6388.782s">We're</a> at for those parents who say we haven't made any progress because. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6394.624s">I</a> think even if you look at this, you might walk away and say, we haven't made any progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6398.846s">And</a> again, I don't think that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6401.987s">But</a> I think a slightly different look at this is something that would be powerful to keep on our website so that when people say things like that, we have a place we can point them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6413.87s">The</a> other thing I would point out is that in the superintendent's email on a weekly basis, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6418.992s">um</a> there is a list of job postings of things that we are positions that are open in the district and after school is not on the list um so it makes me wonder are we hiring for after school or are we not hiring for after school and if we're not hiring for after school why not um and maybe it just needs you know all the other positions are like just a hyperlink um maybe it needs like a few words about what that position is like how flexible it is <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6448.76s">what</a> we're looking for, et cetera, so that you don't have to click into it and go into Frontline to find the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6455.364s">But</a> certainly, it should be on the list, unless and until all of these waitlist issues are resolved, which I know is not a thing we can accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6466.149s">But</a> we should certainly be looking for staff either to make sure you're not having to fill in or that we can do some targeted expansions here and there as people come online.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6488.675s">I</a> think the unmet need is what people talk about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6493.596s">Like,</a> I need something I can't have is the overarching thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6499.237s">I</a> think people do talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6503.405s">wanting</a> to understand the problem and is it getting better or worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6508.773s">So</a> I do think there's some communication or some information that would be helpful on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6514.481s">I</a> did recently hear people talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6520.262s">our</a> registration process being far less sophisticated than some of the private programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6528.367s">And</a> maybe there are some opportunities to work with our communications director and the website team to sort of shore up that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6536.372s">So</a> I think there's lots of opportunities across <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6539.614s">the</a> the sort of spectrum of what is needed but I think the big thing that I hear consistently is the unmet need is still the unmet need and it's not improving and I don't think that's true um and I think this report says that but you have to sort of work at it to get to that explanation so maybe there's a way that our communications director can help put something on the website that like makes that a little bit more clear.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6655.464s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think when I think of unmet need, it's people who are <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6664.19s">not</a> in an afterschool program who believe that they need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6669.394s">And</a> I would challenge anybody who talks about working at home as like an opportunity to watch your kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6676.3s">If</a> you are working at home, you are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6678.922s">And</a> having kids at home is, if you wouldn't bring your kid to the office, we can't reasonably expect people to do that at home either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6688.15s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6689.312s">And</a> lots of companies have very strict and rigid rules around what must be in place in order to even allow that so I think if people are, to me, unmet need is, I'm trying to get into an after school program and I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6706.844s">And</a> for why you're trying to get into an afterschool program is not something I don't think we need to be particularly concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6716.752s">And</a> like I said, I think it has gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6718.994s">There's</a> lots of programs on here that weren't here a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6723.197s">And</a> they are taking 40, 30, 45 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6728.642s">Those</a> are all kids who were part of unmet need not that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6733.926s">who</a> now have a place right and I think it's to me like what I'm envisioning for our communications director because I know he's here is something that combines all of these independent charts and provides a picture where you don't have to sort of work hard to like look at all the the the weedy details and you can know that <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6757.039s">Our,</a> the totality of our need is changing and it's increasing or decreasing or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6762.344s">So</a> I think that is what I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6764.866s">I</a> think people would appreciate that because I think people try to understand what's going on and find it very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6773.875s">And</a> in the end, we're not telling them information that makes them particularly happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6778.34s">So</a> serving it up in the sort of most cohesive way possible often is like a way around the fact that we're fundamentally giving people bad news when we're saying, no, I'm sorry, we don't have a space for your child in our program.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7433.432s">Are</a> you following the state level conversations around vocational school admissions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7440.534s">I</a> know they've gotten heated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7442.295s">I</a> haven't been as plugged into them, but I think that the general story is that vocational school enrollment has become so competitive that they are no longer equitable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7521.091s">And</a> then I would also like to see there be like radically improved communication to ninth grade parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7529.634s">in</a> that transition from the rotational exploratory program to like, you're making a choice for the next three years of high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7537.781s">Like</a> that came and went with like a lot of confusion last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7541.924s">And</a> my daughter was in that grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7543.966s">So</a> I heard from a lot of parents who were like, I don't even know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7547.588s">My</a> kid is picking something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7549.39s">I</a> had people be like, my kid is picking something I think is like a really terrible choice for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7553.053s">I</a> don't know what to do about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7554.854s">And</a> I think parents just like very much felt <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7558.457s">left</a> out of that conversation in a way that was hard, I think was challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7566.499s">And</a> to your point about taking a spot away, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7570.34s">But</a> at the same time, they're in ninth grade, and they don't know what they want and what they don't want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7579.022s">And</a> so I don't know how you overcome that except to open the lines of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7584.963s">So</a> I think that's important to really think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7588.417s">And</a> maybe think about like is it forever if you go in at in that like maybe are there two decision points like one in the last part of ninth grade and another at the end of ninth grade so that there is an opening or something in 10th grade if kids try try it out and decide it's really not for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7608.311s">I</a> don't know, I just, the communication was a real missed opportunity last year for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7612.594s">And</a> I just had a front row seat because my daughter was like in that loop and actually like picked a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7619.279s">She</a> went to school that day and I was like, I don't know what she's gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7621.881s">And</a> when she came home, we're like, what did you decide? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7625.924s">But</a> it was very much, you know, she was fine to do it on her own and we were really happy that she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7634.77s">I</a> don't think every kid is in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7637.471s">And</a> I think there's a lot of parents who had a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7640.893s">And</a> I think one of the big questions is always like, what does it mean to be in a vocational program? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7647.316s">And</a> it's not the same in every vocational program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7650.526s">Where</a> are you going, if you are in x vocational program versus why and those answers are very very different in the programming that we have and they also are nothing like being in a vocational program when we were kids right so I don't think we've ever like really unlocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7667.932s">describing</a> that to parents in a way that resonates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7671.194s">I</a> mean, I've heard you say lots of times, it's not like it used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7675.216s">And</a> I think people are like, oh, cool, but what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7678.557s">So</a> I do think there's still some work to do to educate the parents in this conversation about what it means for them academically. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7688.722s">I</a> wouldn't have inserted myself, but it was not clear to me last year that my daughter was now gonna take <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7698.658s">online</a> Spanish, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7700.239s">Like</a> I think I conceptually knew that, but because I sit here, not because I was like sort of informed of that as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7706.603s">So</a> I just think there's a lot of academic pieces of the puzzle that are not as easy to put together on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7714.267s">So</a> I don't know if maybe just like informational Zoom would help or something would help parents feel better about navigating that transition.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7815.718s">And</a> then I guess the other thing I would encourage you to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7819.8s">We,</a> we outlined a series of expanded programs in our MSBA application that we worked on back in May, June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7831.246s">And</a> we actually did lay out some level of programming that didn't need to wait for a new building and others that did like others that were like completely space constrained and we could not move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7843.149s">The</a> reason I bring that up is because, with a successful passage of seven question seven and question eight question eight in particular talks specifically about expanded programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7855.459s">And</a> there's a resolution on the agenda in just a little bit to talk about a supplemental budget in this fiscal year that would be able to spend the money that has been agreed to by the city or by the voters, I guess I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7874.755s">And</a> there just may be an opening there for you to think about like, is there something we can do <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7881.678s">in</a> the short term, whether it's like expanding a program with an additional teacher, and just make sure that Mr. McHugh has that information so when he's putting together the supplemental budget package that we're going to ask for, that if there are particular things that are vocational in nature, that they can be at the table as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7905.478s">And</a> there is like a, you know, we'll talk about this in just a minute, but there is like a near term aspect of that money as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7916.301s">It's</a> not waiting until next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7918.622s">So</a> great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7920.843s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7921.523s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9372.554s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9373.475s">I</a> just wanted to call out for the group that the capital planning piece is on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9380.28s">We</a> have one more subcommittee meeting next week, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9384.122s">And</a> then we have a committee of the whole scheduled for December to do the committee of the whole here to understand what the capital plan looks like for the remainder of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9397.572s">So</a> that'll be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9401.339s">I</a> think we should try this revised calendar for this year in particular because we're also just about to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9408.026s">the</a> budget director to put a supplemental budget together for this fiscal year, which was not planned when we put all this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9414.39s">So</a> I think as long as we can give the council an appropriate heads up that whatever they were expecting from us is going to shift a little bit, I think it'll be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9423.936s">And</a> then I do think we should talk about it after it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9426.778s">And</a> presumably next year, we're not talking about a supplemental budget and decide if the timeline worked or it doesn't work.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9522.026s">Can</a> I jump in? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9523.227s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9523.987s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9525.708s">I</a> did talk to our attorney today and I actually talked to Director Hunt as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9532.011s">So</a> CM at risk, the only person in city who is able to sign a CM at risk contract is the mayor on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9541.635s">What</a> this is doing is just authorizing her to sign a CM at risk contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9546.817s">which</a> essentially allows us to bring the construction folks into the project much sooner than in the typical procurement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9556.18s">And</a> what that is supposed to do is generate a like sort of tighter handoff between the design folks and the construction folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9565.204s">So</a> you don't have the situation where the design folks design something and the construction folks are like, I can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9572.076s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, Moderator): Or whatever the reason might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9574.298s">And</a> it's pretty new to Medford that we are entertaining CM at risk in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9580.003s">And</a> I know MSBA is definitely a fan of CM at risk projects for for big building projects, but I did talk to everybody today and this resolution is just about <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9593.574s">the</a> contract itself and the mayor, the mayor of the city is the only one who can sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9598.598s">So</a> I feel like based on what I was able to learn today, and I did talk to our attorney on the way out, this is in fact consistent with what needs to happen in order to allow that work to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9614.431s">I</a> think he has other steps he has to take that he's less clear about, but this is a step that only we can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9621.187s">And</a> until we take it, they can't move forward with procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9624.329s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9626.131s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9640.541s">So</a> this is not a separate piece of the puzzle that will have to be addressed, but it's not this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9650.565s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9796.422s">Mayor,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9798.024s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9801.525s">I'm</a> super excited that we get to talk about this because it means we were successful in generating $7 million more dollars a year for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9810.814s">So</a> thank you to every voter out there who supported this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9814.078s">It's</a> super important and there's a million, 7 million reasons actually why I'm excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9822.947s">There's</a> a lot of like moving parts of how this works mechanically and I think the city is like finding its way through all of that because we've never done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9831.276s">The</a> council does have papers in front of them to appropriate the money to us, and then in turn what that means is we will need to <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9841.928s">have</a> a public budget hearing like we always do to determine the spending of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9847.897s">The</a> ballot questions were effective July 1 2024 so that does mean the full amount of $7 million will be available <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9858.792s">via</a> the override question will begin to be collected come the January tax bills, but we will have an opportunity to put together a supplemental budget for it to be spent in the last six months of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9872.627s">That</a> has to be consistent with the spirit and nature of the questions and so that is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9880.255s">to</a> answer all the questions of like, will the money be spent how it's supposed to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9883.616s">The</a> answer is yes, it has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9886.336s">And</a> it's going to take some time, I think, for the for the budget director to put together what that spending proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9893.678s">And</a> it's going to take a fair bit of work on behalf of the administration to put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9899.699s">So</a> really sorry, we're asking you to do that between now and January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9903.721s">But</a> it is really urgent because the money, the money does have to be expended in FY 25 so it would be the $7 million in total, less the advance, which we have actually already spent which was 1.75 million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9917.274s">So</a> it's 5.25 million dollars in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9924.501s">1.25</a> of that million dollars is related to the things outlined in question 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9930.725s">4</a> million outlined to the things outlined in question 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9935.429s">They</a> are slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9937.05s">Like,</a> for example, maintenance is a question 7 item that was articulated, not a question 8 item that was articulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9944.935s">So</a> there's going to be a fair bit of work on the budget director's part to figure out what this looks like going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9952.041s">and</a> how we advance things like the consolidated school schedule that Mr. Fallon was just here talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9959.326s">And</a> there's just, there is a literal ton of work to be able to do any of the things that we were hoping to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9966.831s">So</a> the resolution asks that the administration come back to us at the beginning of January with that proposed supplemental budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9976.058s">And</a> now based on member Reinfeld's <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9979.02s">resolution,</a> specifically paying attention to those areas that were cut last year, like nurses, for example, guidance Councilors, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9991.865s">So</a> that we can assess whether, like our secretary at the our administrative assistant and a second administrative assistant at the McGlynn complex, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10002.89s">So</a> those things were cut out of the budget last year, there is an opportunity for us to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10008.032s">remediate</a> that now that the supplemental budget has gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10012.376s">And</a> the question is, I think to member Reinfeld's point, how is it going with this change in staffing and where are the places that we need to shore up and which of those places can we do in the short term in the right now and which of them are really school year positions so that we can plan accordingly for that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10121.075s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5827.904s">Mayor,</a> can I just add some context? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5833.467s">A</a> parent reached out to me about this somewhat recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5838.891s">And</a> I thought there might even be some students on who wanted to speak this evening, but I'm not seeing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5848.577s">But</a> my goal here is to say that the situation with the bathrooms at Medford High <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5855.801s">Is</a> untenable, like, we have students who don't go to the bathroom all day long who don't drink anything during the school day and it's because they have to, like, wander the halls to find an open bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5867.865s">My</a> own daughter says the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5869.485s">And</a> I get that there is, like, a need for us to have some balance between. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5879.924s">everything</a> open all the time and some way to properly supervise these spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5886.467s">But</a> what we're doing right now is not it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5890.669s">We</a> haven't arrived at a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5893.391s">We</a> have arrived at students having to wander the halls to figure out where the bathroom is. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5898.273s">And</a> every time we talk about this, I really hope it's the last time we ever talk about it, because I don't want to talk about the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5907.838s">It</a> just like we never seem to actually make any progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5910.761s">So</a> I am asking the administration to bring forward a proposal of like, tell us what you need in order to improve this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5922.193s">And</a> what will an improved situation look like under some new plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5927.058s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5928.288s">I</a> am asking the administration to come back with a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5934.732s">But</a> I would hope that they will start with saying, what are the problems as all of our constituents in this picture see the problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5945.899s">And</a> how are we going to fix all of those problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5951.656s">There</a> are real constraints from a staffing perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5954.819s">Do</a> we need more staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5956.0s">If</a> we need more staff, what kind of staff do we need and how much will that cost us? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5960.224s">Now</a> is the time for us to be having these conversations because a budget season is coming quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5966.829s">But</a> we may also have an infusion of funding to be talking about very, very shortly here, which I'm hopeful for. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5977.446s">But</a> I want to hear from the administration, what is the totality of the problems that sort of get in the way of everybody feeling bad about the bathroom situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5989.83s">And</a> what could make it better? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5992.711s">What</a> could we do to make the situation better? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5997.513s">And</a> what would that take? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5999.074s">So</a> I'm really asking for somebody to step back from where they are today and figure out, how do we move past this conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6011.163s">Because</a> every time we talk about it, we talk about it as if we have done something different that's going to move us past the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6018.969s">And</a> that's just simply not happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6023.112s">My</a> daughter was telling me just the other day, she's like, oh, yeah, there's no schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6026.855s">Everyone</a> says there's a schedule, but there's no schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6028.976s">And</a> so you just wander the halls until you find a bathroom that you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6032.279s">And</a> they're gross, and there are lots of kids inside vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6036.582s">And</a> so for all the supervision, we're still having all of those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6039.604s">Something</a> has to change in this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6042.046s">It's</a> a real climate and culture issue, in my opinion, for the high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6047.85s">They</a> don't want to go to a school where <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6051.994s">don't</a> want to use the bathrooms because they're gross. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6054.596s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6055.517s">It's</a> all got to change somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6057.838s">And</a> I don't know what the changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6062.061s">I</a> don't know what those things might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6064.403s">But</a> I am asking for us to actually dig in and come up with something that is a solution rather than just sort of shrugging and continuing to do the same things we've always done that don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6079.028s">So</a> that's the genesis of this resolution.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6740.772s">I</a> guess some of these things that are frankly, I'm really happy that Francis has supported us because we've just simply not been staffed to be able to do some of these things ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6753.58s">But</a> we have made some investments in the HR team in particular, and I think we should be looking at what is the right thing for <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6766.625s">For</a> the district for a district of our size to have 800 employees, having this capability is, I think, important for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6776.43s">I</a> think the lines get very blurry when things go over to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6781.573s">So,</a> for example, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6783.414s">something</a> comes to Francis's desk and then it requires some sort of appeal, does it go to the mayor or does it go to the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6790.676s">Because</a> the mayor doesn't have the authority over the schools that the superintendent does. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6796.417s">And</a> I just think when I look at this list, there are certain pieces of this list that I frankly would expect the administration to be able to handle without needing Francis's support. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6807.58s">And</a> I think there's other stuff that <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6810.781s">The</a> team probably needs training on to do well, but I don't think the answer is personally continuing to to sort of rely on whatever you know sort of slice of Francis's time she can provide so. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6827.029s">I'm</a> not super in favor of this and it's not because I'm not grateful, but I think actually the thing I would want Francis to do is train our own staff so that we have this capability within our schools in a way that allows the people who spend the most time in the schools to be able to do this work that's relative and specific to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6848.391s">I</a> have some real reservations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6851.032s">I</a> also feel like we sort of are heading down a slippery slope of shared services, which was not the intention, at least for me, when we decided to accept that statute and share some resource on the facility side. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6867.722s">And</a> you did mention some sort of stipend, but this doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6874.677s">say</a> what that is or who pays for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6876.901s">So</a> I have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6878.904s">I'm</a> not particularly in favor of this as written, but I will defer to my colleagues who might have other thoughts.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7679.003s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7682.025s">Still</a> unclear what the stipend is that we're tacitly approving and who is paying for it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7725.575s">It's</a> not what we're talking about here, but we did not approve to pay for that stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7730.377s">So</a> I just want to point that out as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7733.978s">If</a> we're going to do these things, I think we need to be really clear about who's paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7738.66s">Like</a> my understanding was that a stipend would be paid, but I was under the impression the city was going to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7744.322s">And</a> so now that's coming to our budget, which means this committee should be approving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7748.743s">and</a> deciding on what's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7750.324s">So</a> I do think we have to get a little bit more precise. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7755.349s">When</a> I look at this list, I understand that these are all things that have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7759.612s">But</a> I just have some real questions about why our central administration can't handle some of these things without Francis's support. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7767.679s">So</a> I understand it's lovely and amazing to have somebody who you can call to provide <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7773.544s">input</a> and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7774.545s">I</a> have colleagues like that all that I rely on in that same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7779.827s">But</a> that's to me different than saying this is part of Francis's set of responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7787.291s">What's</a> not on here is any transition that would actually put the schools in a position to be able to do some of these things for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7797.85s">Particularly</a> around accommodations, I don't know how many there are on an annual basis, but our HR team should be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7805.98s">An</a> HR department of 800 employees should be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7809.364s">And</a> I understand that that requires some specific training and we don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7813.99s">So</a> I, I am, I'm fine with. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7816.833s">some</a> of this stuff happening temporarily, but that's not what this says, which is why I am in favor of sending it to subcommittee so that we can ask our HR people and Francis to get in a room and talk about what is best for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7833.878s">I</a> would really prefer to hear from them about it than this group of people who's not involved in that work to decide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7843.195s">Um,</a> I just, I have some, so I still, I know what I now know what we're paying already for his support. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7850.941s">Um,</a> but I still don't think I know what the proposed stipend is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7854.024s">And</a> if we are making a budget expenditure, we need to know what that is.<h2><a href="../2024-10-29_bQ7rGA39hAo/2024-10-29_bQ7rGA39hAo.html">Special MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=0.389s">in</a> the interest of time, get going through this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=6.815s">So</a> we do have a quorum, so I think we can start. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=10.078s">I</a> will read the agenda and then we can call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=16.043s">Please</a> be advised that on October 28th at 5 p.m., there will be a special meeting of the Medford School Committee to be held remotely via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=23.41s">This</a> meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=25.746s">The</a> meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast Channel 9, 8 or 22 and Verizon Channel 43, 45 or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=39.015s">The</a> meeting will be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=40.596s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in by using the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=45.859s">The</a> meeting ID is 917-5576-1532. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=53.522s">Questions</a> or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=61.85s">And</a> those too many questions must also include the following your first and last name, your Medford street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=69.252s">Uh,</a> member Rousseau, if you could call the roll.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=92.689s">So</a> for president and three absent, um, if we can all please stand to salute the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=117.184s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=119.629s">Our</a> agenda today is long and short. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=124.05s">We</a> have one item on the agenda, that's the short part. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=127.571s">The</a> long part is that it is the first reading of Policy ACGB Title IX Sexual Discrimination Grievance Procedure Resolution 2024-38 offered by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=143.656s">Member</a> Ruseau, before we <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=145.859s">Dive</a> into reading this 18 page policy, did you want to give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=150.161s">Um,</a> uh, some headlines about what this policy is all about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=428.815s">Is</a> there a motion to waive the reading?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=437.561s">So</a> a motion to waive the reading by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=439.743s">I'll</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=441.584s">Seconded</a> by Member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=444.706s">Roll</a> call.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=451.731s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=476.201s">Um,</a> so remember, so I think it probably makes sense to go through this like chunk by chunk and just ask for folks to let us know if they have questions or comments, um, about that as we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=489.812s">And</a> then once we, um, go through that, we can sort of see where we land and decide, you know, if there's another motion to entertain, um, whether to pass this or, or, um, pass it on to another meeting or, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=505.256s">take</a> care of waving, reading both readings here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=509.711s">So</a> before we.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=547.567s">Remember</a> so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=660.498s">It'd</a> be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=664.841s">And</a> then let's, we can start at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=669.127s">There</a> is a preamble that goes on for several pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=672.47s">So</a> up until page halfway down page five is a preamble that, um, in my reading describes like what the intention of the policy is and why it was, um, built in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=688.544s">So</a> I will, um, open the floor to any questions about the preamble.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=707.267s">Hearing</a> and seeing no questions on the preamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=710.75s">The</a> next section is definitions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=808.808s">And</a> this is, I guess my only thought is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=812.938s">that</a> we're not changing anything of substance, but we might be if we make this change, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=820.343s">If</a> we're not intending for it to be substantive, but it would be unbeknownst to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=827.188s">So</a> I would advocate that we leave it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=830.511s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=832.372s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=842.8s">Okay,</a> so about halfway down page five, we start with definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=850.184s">And</a> it looks like they go to page eight, halfway down page eight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=857.627s">Yes,</a> I am looking at the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=858.887s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=859.848s">That's</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=887.041s">Questions</a> about the definitions? <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=895.648s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=896.629s">The</a> next section is about reporting sexual discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=902.435s">and</a> filing a formal complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=905.096s">So</a> that goes on for several pages.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1079.234s">Not</a> in the policy that I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1081.195s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1160.635s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1227.156s">It</a> also doesn't want to read 18 page prophecies.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1732.686s">Can</a> you give us an example? <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1733.966s">Like</a> I'm not tracking like a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1736.927s">If</a> a group does something, it's because individuals in the group did something, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1813.473s">I</a> mean, I think in the end, like, the district can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1821.076s">Like,</a> they can't broadly meet out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1824.538s">Consequences,</a> like, they have to do that specifically and individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1828.719s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1829.34s">So</a> I could see why a parents would.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1921.232s">So,</a> Member Reinfeld, as it relates to a Title IX investigation,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3045.145s">So</a> is your suggestion that there be more than one person listed as an appeals facilitator?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3407.974s">Are</a> there any other? <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3412.947s">questions</a> or changes suggested?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3574.543s">There</a> are a motion to approve the first reading.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3681.824s">Okay,</a> so the second reading will be on our next school committee agenda, which is a week from today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3694.03s">Are</a> there any other motions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3699.613s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3701.635s">Motion</a> to adjourn by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3703.576s">I'm</a> on a second roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3705.917s">Let's</a> do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3707.538s">Member</a> Bramley, roll call.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=222.433s">Can</a> you all hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=224.654s">Hi</a> everyone, my name is Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=226.315s">I</a> think I know many or most of you from five years as a school committee member, most recently I've been vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=234.137s">I'm</a> also the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee for the Princeton household, commonly referred to as FSEA. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=242.521s">FSEA</a> is a statewide authority that helps communities like ours build new high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=249.003s">So</a> we're not here to talk about anything for high school, but I do want to mention that that is another hat that I wear, so if you have questions about that, I'm happy to answer them after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=258.529s">I'm</a> excited that we're here because I'm excited that we all get to participate in this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=265.453s">So</a> this is the first time in Medgar we've ever let everybody have a choice and a voice in how our students forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=273.478s">And</a> we have some really big questions on the ballot this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=276.74s">In</a> my opinion, we should have done this sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=279.501s">We</a> can debate the merits of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=281.582s">Again,</a> at another time, maybe over coffee or a cocktail. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=285.863s">But</a> here we are and we have some choices to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=288.764s">If</a> you're following the school budget over the course of the last year, you know that we faced some very difficult decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=297.107s">That's</a> a nice way to say we laid off human beings who work in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=302.109s">So</a> trust me when I tell you nobody wants to do that, no matter what side of the aisle you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=308.951s">There's</a> really a disagreement that we need more and not fewer mental health supporters in our schools, that our teachers do without, that our buildings are in disrepair, and that we have no current cut forward to fund our technology replacement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=325.656s">So,</a> those are real facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=328.437s">They</a> were very present when we negotiated the budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=333.32s">The</a> initial budget was much worse than where it landed, and we only landed in a slightly less bad place because we used one-time funds, also known as free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=346.005s">to</a> temporarily fill the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=349.067s">That's</a> not a funding strategy for operating costs on a going forward basis or really for any sustainable content at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=355.949s">I</a> know that, I'm a finance major, I have a degree from Babson College, I run a business, I absolutely understand what it takes to make good decisions about these kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=366.614s">And</a> sometimes you have to do the things in the short term that give you the bridge to the long term and that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=371.796s">So</a> here we are, we're at sort of the other side of that bridge, and we're ready to make a plan for the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=378.641s">I</a> am hopeful that the energy in this community is going to say yes, we want to invest in Medford, we want to invest in kids, we want to invest in our fire department, we want to invest in our roads, and we will have a completely different conversation next time than really we've had for the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=394.331s">budget</a> cycles that I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=395.992s">It's</a> always just been some version of bad because there simply is not enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=401.496s">And</a> I am ready to have a different conversation where we can talk about doing more for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=406.7s">So</a> I'll leave it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=407.94s">I'm</a> going to pass it to Naomi Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=410.222s">And</a> we are excited to be here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=412.323s">We're</a> happy to answer your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=414.965s">And</a> that's it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1568.602s">The</a> only other thing I'll say about free cash from my perspective, that money is the bucket of money that we can use to do capital projects at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1579.834s">So</a> if there's nothing left at the end of the year, there are no opportunities for capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1586.04s">The</a> school budget is not resourced. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1588.863s">to</a> do big capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1591.005s">We</a> rely on the city to be able to grant those one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1594.847s">That's</a> a very typical process in communities across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1599.69s">Cities</a> usually do sort of pick up the cost of those school-based projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1606.745s">The</a> school committee has re-launched a different and more rigorous capital planning process this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1615.371s">We</a> held our first meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1617.233s">Part</a> of the reason we did that is I see some folks in the room who were part of building these new schools, and since then we really haven't done the right thing to maintain them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.441s">And</a> why? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.961s">Money.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1630.043s">It</a> costs money to do maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1631.964s">So</a> there's a couple of ways we have to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1634.866s">One</a> is, we have to start doing that maintenance, which means the operating budget of the schools has to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1640.37s">That's</a> not free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1641.631s">But</a> the other is, we have realities like a broken water heater at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1646.734s">They</a> have to prepare food for children at the Brooks, and they need to be able to sanitize their equipment, and they don't have a hot water heater. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1654.219s">So</a> they are, our staff are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1656.801s">They</a> do everything that they can to work on all this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1659.683s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1661.994s">All</a> of the ways we could have done maintenance to this point and didn't, that leads us to capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1668.797s">And</a> so we have to get out of this cycle of waiting until something, there's a hole in the roof, a roof falls in, a hot water heater is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1677.782s">We</a> should be able to do a better job with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1680.894s">And</a> we can say that we should have done a better job for the last however long the schools have been built, 20 years, 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1687.762s">I</a> agree with all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1689.003s">But</a> here we are, and we have choices to make about how we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1693.228s">And</a> for me, I want to move forward in a productive way that addresses the backlog and sets us up on a path to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1700.576s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2294.41s">Jen,</a> would you like to start? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2298.034s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2300.436s">We</a> put out an explainer, there's some copies of it in the back, it's, we call it a one-pager because it's intended to be printed from the back, but maybe it's a two-pager to some. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2311.263s">That</a> document was our, my attempt with Member Reinfeld, who I think is here somewhere, I think she's in the back, to be responsive to people saying, well, what is this for? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2324.651s">And</a> the sneaky part is that when you're talking about the school budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2328.914s">80-85%</a> of the school budget is subject to collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2333.422s">So</a> that means 80-85% of our costs are about personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2339.231s">It's</a> not uncommon, we're not unusual in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2342.737s">But</a> the truth of the matter is, we can't decide how much we're going to pay anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2349.658s">That</a> happens at a bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2351.819s">And</a> in order to put information out, we would have to be doing that in collaboration with people at the bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2359.2s">Having</a> those kinds of conversations when there is actually no money to spend is exceedingly difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2367.648s">So</a> what we did instead was try to give you an understanding based on numbers we could share, like how much those salaries cost in this past year that we used one-time funds to fund, how many positions we saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2381.734s">So</a> we really tried in question seven on that explainer to tell you a little bit about what we're preserving when that question is successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2391.258s">For</a> question eight, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2392.97s">What</a> we tried to do, this one gets a little bit harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2397.793s">Because</a> what we start to talk about is what could we do in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2402.055s">And</a> again, we're back at the bargaining table to talk about things like living wages for our paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2409.238s">We've</a> done a lot of work to improve the pay scales for our paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2414.861s">They</a> used to barely make a minimum wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2417.502s">Now</a> they make more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2420.304s">But</a> they come to the table and tell us that they deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2425.393s">We</a> agree, but there is no more. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2427.435s">So,</a> what we tried to do in that explainer, take a look, have the answer questions afterwards, is give you some details about what we might do with the knowledge that it will all be spent on schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2439.823s">The</a> school committee, through its statutory process around budgets, will hold hearings and pass a budget in the open. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2447.969s">So,</a> we're here to pass a budget in the open. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2450.331s">That's</a> what we're going to do when this is successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2454.392s">Or</a> we will cut the budget in the open. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2456.294s">That's</a> the alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2457.174s">So</a> what seven does is help us not keep cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2461.517s">What</a> eight does is allow us to have a different conversation about the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2465.619s">That</a> is not about doing less and less.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2621.615s">So</a> I actually went digging and Bedford has a history of flatlining budgets for the schools or giving an increase that's not enough to cover contractual increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.065s">That</a> is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.766s">That</a> has happened in Bedford for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2638.908s">The</a> only time I could find an instance where we actually <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2643.51s">reduced</a> the school budget was like back in the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2646.576s">So</a> we really don't have a history of cutting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2650.482s">We</a> have some history, unfortunately, of flatlining the budget, and we have some history of underfunding the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2656.923s">So</a> there's really no history of us cutting the budget on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2661.227s">Other</a> departments, I think for sure, have had different experiences with that, but when we talk about could we cut the budget, if we did, we would be handing out pay slips. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2672.256s">We</a> would be talking about the positions that we're eliminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2676.98s">And</a> that's not what anybody wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2679.922s">It's</a> not my priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2682.364s">There</a> needs to be more help for our students, not less. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2686.367s">So</a> that fear, I understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2689.768s">When</a> you don't get to personally hand out the dollars, I understand that there's always a feeling that someone might not do it the way that you do, but that's why we have a committee of seven people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2700.532s">The</a> mayor doesn't get to decide this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2702.572s">I</a> don't get to decide this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2704.433s">It</a> requires the majority vote of the school committee to spend every single penny that is spent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3063.578s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3065.26s">So</a> to the questions that are in the community about the finance task force, that's exactly what we did each time we met. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3073.089s">We</a> had one question to answer, which was, what is our go forward plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3078.396s">We</a> talked in a lot of detail about what that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3082.159s">We</a> talked a lot about plans for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3084.361s">We</a> talked about the high school coming online. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3086.403s">We</a> talked about is this the start of a series of overrides or is it the end? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3091.968s">You</a> know, is it a one-time shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3093.649s">And</a> we sort of landed <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3095.031s">I</a> guess I would say somewhere in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3096.532s">So</a> we do not want to be putting questions before you like some communities do every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3103.535s">We're</a> new at this in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3104.876s">We</a> have no community muscle around how to do it, how to have productive conversations that are respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3110.798s">We're</a> all learning through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3112.439s">So</a> you're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3113.74s">You're</a> not all in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3114.84s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3117.021s">And</a> what we landed on was a number that was big enough to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3121.824s">smaller</a> than what the real need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3124.105s">And</a> what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3125.265s">That</a> means we have, again, created a bridge to a place where development can help start to carry some more of the load than it historically has been able to do in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3137.767s">The</a> final comment was about the school committee raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3140.448s">I</a> just want to correct the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3142.148s">We</a> did not receive a 143% raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3146.649s">we</a> received a $5,000 raise for the first time for the position in 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3153.151s">I</a> could tell you and we can talk afterwards about all the work that the school committee does, it is equivalent to the work of the council and I continue to believe that we should be paid the same as the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3165.613s">But</a> 5,000 is not 143% of $12,000, so that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3168.594s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3356.794s">On</a> the school side, I would point you to the detailed graphic that actually does talk about the positions we saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3364.117s">Those</a> would be the first positions that would be cut in another sort of down budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3371.601s">So</a> if these are not successful, those positions are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3376.823s">July</a> 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3377.683s">So</a> we will say goodbye to humans who work in our school district again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3380.584s">I</a> don't want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3382.345s">I</a> don't want us to keep all of those folks because they're really important to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3386.966s">And</a> more importantly, I want to have the ability to address some of the structural issues that we have in our schools around totally incompatible high school schedules, the minimum number of hours that the state allows us, not enough transportation, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3404.324s">can't</a> even meet conversations if question 8 does not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3408.229s">If</a> they pass, we can have a conversation and we will have to decide what our priorities are because <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3414.841s">There's</a> $4 million is not the full enchilada in terms of fully funding everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3419.923s">We're</a> still very far away from a free public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3423.945s">We</a> can debate the merits of free public school systems and things like free lunch at another time, but this amount of money does not put us even in the legal territory of giving away a free education, which probably I think we should do, but that's not what this does. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3440.951s">This</a> helps us move forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3797.866s">January</a> 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3798.626s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3800.327s">Except</a> question six, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3802.509s">The</a> debt exclusion is not until there's an actual bond to be issued.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4631.917s">Our</a> overall school enrollment hasn't changed that much in the last handful of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4637.438s">What</a> we are experiencing is record numbers of kindergartners coming into our schools every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4645.3s">So</a> if you use what they call a survival analysis that says how does that kindergartner become a first grader and a second grader and a third grader, the numbers climb over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4657.967s">But</a> what we do know is that two of our school buildings are absolutely busting at the seams. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4664.734s">The</a> Roberts and the Brooks are busting at the seams. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4667.677s">There's</a> not any more space in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4670.78s">So</a> if we have another record kindergarten here next year, we're going to have an issue in those two buildings in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4677.467s">That's</a> not the case in all four of our elementary school buildings and so there's some <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4681.84s">potentially</a> expensive redistricting that we may have to do pretty urgently to deal with the realities of how the population is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4692.525s">We</a> also, looking forward, are looking at our population in our school system changing as we invest in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4702.989s">We</a> expect more parents to <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4709.284s">increase</a> the number of students, both at the middle school and the high school is our prediction.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4800.43s">Okay,</a> I'll take a shot at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4801.831s">How</a> did we get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4804.112s">We</a> have been constrained by Prop 2.5 since 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4806.933s">That's</a> how we got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4808.073s">Inflation</a> is more than 2.5% every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4811.895s">You</a> can see, actually we should pass this chart around. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4814.936s">You</a> can see that Medford's new growth has been marginal since that same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4819.939s">So</a> the two levers we have are taxation and new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4823.78s">And</a> we haven't done any more taxation than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4828.092s">and</a> our new growth has been very minor in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4833.273s">Meanwhile,</a> all of our costs are exploding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4835.393s">Our</a> healthcare, our pensions, all of those things go up in double digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4840.214s">So</a> we're sort of at a squeeze point and we have decisions that we have to make as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4845.335s">Why</a> we didn't do it sooner, it takes a tremendous amount of will for elected officials to allow the city to vote in a representative way. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4858.413s">When</a> you're an elected official, you have what many people think is tons of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4862.658s">I</a> don't personally feel that way, but lots of people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4866.242s">And</a> you have a lot of decisions to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4868.484s">And</a> so there's two ways you can make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4870.286s">One</a> is you can make decisions, and the other is you can ask the community to help you make the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4875.332s">So</a> this is us saying to you, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4877.472s">we're</a> asking you to help us make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4880.253s">So</a> there is no more direct democracy than a ballot question in a presidential election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4886.154s">We</a> are expecting wonderful turnout, there's a lot of energy, and we're super excited to see what this community really thinks of us.<h2><a href="../2024-10-22_kgJb8ZwdaF0/2024-10-22_kgJb8ZwdaF0.html">10.21.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.469s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.809s">A</a> couple of quick notes for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=15.313s">We</a> had our first strategic capital planning meeting around this capital plan specifically last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=23.819s">We</a> have another meeting scheduled for November 19th to finish the draft of the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=31.545s">And</a> after that in December, we will have a committee of the whole scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=36.449s">All</a> of those meetings are Zoom only. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=38.89s">And</a> we in December will have a capital plan for this group to work through, ask questions about and prioritize so that we can give direction to the district about any CPC funding we want to direct the district to apply for to the mayor and the council about the immediate capital needs and the upcoming capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.144s">etcetera.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.644s">So,</a> there we had a good productive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=65.507s">It</a> started with the input of the building principles across the district to identify some of those projects that were maybe not otherwise listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=75.936s">So,</a> we've updated the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=77.577s">There</a> are a number of capital projects in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=79.859s">So,</a> those those are noted as well and there's a huge number of upcoming capital needs, not the least of which is the HVAC <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=88.146s">project</a> at McGlynn and Andrews, but all of that is being sort of packaged up as part of the policy that we passed last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=94.911s">And</a> we will be ready to share in a committee of the whole in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=100.676s">So</a> right on schedule with our with our timeline so that that does not interfere with our typical budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=108.361s">Whether</a> that interferes with other supplemental appropriation budgets is sort of a one-time thing for us to consider maybe this year, but generally speaking, I think we're on a good track to not overlap the budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=120.732s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=122.694s">Member</a> Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1866.803s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1868.384s">I</a> don't know if this is a question for the folks on Zoom, but I was curious how many filling stations we would be eligible for in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1878.527s">Is</a> it per number of students? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1881.148s">Is</a> it based on square footage? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1883.409s">How</a> do you decide how many we would be eligible for under the grant?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1935.95s">Wow,</a> that's fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1937.711s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1938.091s">And</a> I think the other question that I had was, are the results that we saw here unusual in any way? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1947.233s">Like</a> my first thought was like, how do we have all this like lead in our fixtures? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1952.035s">And</a> I just didn't know if this was unusual in some way for us or if this is pretty common based on what you see in other districts.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2004.508s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2005.108s">That</a> is just helpful context to understand because our buildings were not generally built before 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2011.25s">So</a> is the typical remediation, I know it's different for everybody, but is the typical remediation at that point, simply replace, I'll say simply, but simply replacing the fixtures, or are there other potential things that need to happen in terms of our planning?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.009s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.47s">And</a> I will just note to the committee that we will put this faucet replacement remediation on the capital plan as well, just so we don't lose track of it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3688.353s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3689.013s">Hi,</a> I'm Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3690.354s">Thank</a> you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3691.375s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3693.657s">How,</a> when you think about the people that are in the pipeline to be tested, how many of them are coming to Medford and do you have any timeline at all?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3798.025s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3800.618s">A</a> couple of other things I think just strategically, there's a lot of conversation in Medford about the huge thousand kids who are not eligible for transportation to the middle and the high schools because they live between one and two miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3814.962s">And</a> your bus drivers can probably tell you that traffic around Medford is a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3819.803s">I</a> am shocked that anybody gets to school on time at Medford High because I live a few blocks away and it's like impassable to get through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3830.186s">even</a> until almost eight o'clock and school starts at like 740 or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3833.668s">So</a> I think the other thing that we're talking about is all of those people who are driving their kids to school, that's a hardship for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3844.674s">It's</a> bad for our roads and it would be far more efficient to put those kids on a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3850.097s">We</a> obviously don't have the money to do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3853.56s">But</a> if that is to change like we I think we could be in a position that when we go out to bid we would be looking for additional buses and I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3865.905s">I</a> would be interested to know from you all how we can help the bus driver shortage situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3872.25s">I'm</a> not sure there's much we can do, but if there is something we can do, please let us know because it's really important that kids get to school on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3880.555s">And</a> if the bus is late, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3883.257s">If</a> their parents can't drive them and they're walking two miles, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3887.901s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we're doing what we can to support <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3891.863s">you</a> all as you think about getting additional drivers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3895.764s">The</a> other comment I did have about the afterschool programs in the afternoons, I appreciate the willingness to send the buses when they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3908.969s">I</a> think that is a huge help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3911.97s">And</a> the folks whose kids are sitting and waiting <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3916.391s">for</a> a really long time are really appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3918.552s">They</a> obviously want that to already have happened and be done yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3923.514s">But</a> I was talking to some parents recently, and they were talking about how their kid spends an hour on the bus from the Roberts to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3932.459s">And</a> you all made some sort of route adjustment recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3935.52s">And</a> the parent sought me out to tell me that the change was dramatic for their kids getting off at their after-school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3943.644s">And</a> it was the difference but it was like a 40 minute 45 minute difference so thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3950.091s">And</a> I am, I am interested in where else our roots can be optimized like that so that kids are not sitting on the bus because the truth is they're sitting in the elementary schools for some amount of time before they even get on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3964.426s">for</a> kids to not be getting to an after school program till like after 4pm 430. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3970.932s">It's</a> a very, very long time to wait and parents are paying for those services that they're not getting so <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3977.153s">If</a> there are other route optimizations that can happen, I assume you use some sort of geo software that helps map the routes, but we would certainly be interested in anything you can do to support route optimization to get kids to their destination just a little bit faster.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4103.362s">And</a> then my last question, we have had multiple incidents where students have been let off the bus in the wrong place this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4112.246s">And</a> I fielded a call from a parent who was pretty distraught about that on a recent Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4120.689s">And</a> so I'm just curious from your standpoint, like, is there something we're doing in Medford that is exacerbating <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4127.412s">This</a> situation where five year olds get off the bus and cross the square by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4131.935s">Is</a> there something we could be doing differently to assist your drivers like what how do we make sure five year olds are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4138.513s">traversing</a> the square by themselves because they got off at the wrong stop.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4216.864s">And</a> so what can we do in Medford to make this easier on your drivers because <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4224.918s">I</a> feel for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4227.499s">I</a> thought 63 was the number, so I'm a little blown away that it's 77. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4231.581s">But</a> obviously, it's a really hard job for them to keep control of the bus, to keep all the things from going right on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4240.284s">And</a> I'm just curious from your standpoint, what should we be doing that would help the situation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4269.564s">Does</a> Cambridge pay for those monitors?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4309.943s">They're</a> all going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4311.024s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4380.64s">appreciate</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4382.401s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4383.442s">So</a> I think my request to the superintendent is that the principals be asked to make sure that kids are all tagged, that there is some sort of protocol for what happens when a new student gets on the bus so that we're in communication with the bus driver as as that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4401.479s">feel</a> like I've seen that happen before when I've been in sort of bus area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4407.321s">But</a> just to make sure that it is happening with some consistency, I think would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4413.003s">And</a> to try to lighten the load from a bus driver perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4418.765s">And</a> then your point about bus monitors, we've been asked that question many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4423.986s">Obviously,</a> it's a very expensive endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4427.117s">and</a> perhaps there's some relief coming on that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4430.999s">So</a> stay tuned for more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4434.221s">Thank</a> you very much for being here.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_MVExTf_vuaw/2024-10-16_MVExTf_vuaw.html">MSC Strategic & Capital Planning Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=30.857s">Let</a> me just one second to find the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=70.638s">That</a> was open apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=71.939s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=82.805s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=85.167s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to read the meeting notice so we can get started and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=91.311s">We</a> can dive in, so please be advised that on Tuesday, October 15th at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=101.363s">held</a> through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=103.563s">This</a> meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=105.464s">The</a> meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel, Comcast 9, 8, or 22, and Verizon channel 43, 45, or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=117.606s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call in by using the following link. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=121.907s">The</a> meeting ID is 957-9454-4382. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=128.868s">Additionally,</a> questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=137.13s">Those</a> submitting must include the filing information, your first name and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=145.452s">I'm</a> going to call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=147.412s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=149.032s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=150.753s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=151.873s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.253s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.953s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=154.333s">So</a> three present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=157.995s">Our</a> agenda today is really to kick off the strategic and capital planning process, particularly with a focus on the capital planning component, which is based on the policy that we passed unanimously last spring to lay out a series of steps for capital planning that <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=177.944s">line</a> up and to the best of our ability, don't overlap budget season because that becomes too many things at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=187.27s">So</a> the goal here is for us to do this capital planning work in advance of the sort of operating budget conversation so that A, we can feed that both to the mayor and to the council in advance of budget season, but also so that we're not sort of stepping on <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=207.045s">The</a> need for, you know, extra meetings and things like that, um, for all of our staff, uh, for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.25s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.49s">Um,</a> we have a meeting scheduled today and then we have a meeting scheduled in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=217.894s">Um,</a> we may or may not need both meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=221.117s">We'll</a> sort of see how it goes today, but the goal for us is to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=226.894s">take</a> last year's capital plan and go through it together and make some updates to it to the best of our knowledge, as well as add potential capital projects to it that don't exist on there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=244.76s">And</a> we'll talk a little bit about some of the work Peter has been doing to collect that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=249.721s">And</a> then really the other thing for us to do will be ultimately to come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=256.263s">an</a> attempt at prioritization of some kind for the whole giant list, um, so that we can clearly identify that for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=265.287s">Um,</a> and then ultimately, um, to the mayor and the council and also, um, identify if there are projects that are potentially eligible for community preservation at, um, act funding, um, whether there's projects that are <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=282.578s">eligible</a> to be included in that school spending, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=285.839s">And</a> then, you know, sort of all other and to start to have an ongoing process, which has been a little bit haphazard over the last couple of years, or really maybe forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=298.744s">But</a> certainly, that it's been a thing that has been a work in progress for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=303.765s">So</a> really trying to get a more stringent process in place that aligns with that policy is sort of where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=310.607s">Does</a> that make sense so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=316.844s">I</a> am going to pull up a copy of Our Last capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=330.031s">One</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=379.292s">This</a> is where I will note my extreme dislike of Google Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=384.033s">So</a> give me just one more second and we'll find it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=392.596s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=393.176s">I</a> think I found it at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=394.837s">OK,</a> found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=397.398s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=399.638s">I'm</a> going to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=403.665s">Um,</a> so the first thing I thought we would do is just refresh everyone's memory about what, um, the capital plan looks like as it existed last year when we met. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=418.274s">Um,</a> and then we can talk a little bit about, um, where we are with some of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=424.638s">Can</a> you all see that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=436.65s">better?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=442.956s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=446.86s">Okay,</a> so this is the capital plan as of the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=451.865s">We</a> talked about all of these projects in our capital planning meeting and then this ultimately is also the capital plan that was submitted to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=460.874s">Um,</a> so it contained the projects, uh, that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=466.018s">We</a> knew about or we're planning for last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=468.82s">Um,</a> and so let's just sort of go from top to bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=472.804s">So</a> the first three projects are led light replacement projects, um, for Brooks, Missittuck and Medford high. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=480.289s">Um,</a> those are, um, at the time we said they were planned for FYI 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=489.11s">And</a> the way this works, my understanding is that it's on-bill financing through National Grid, and that we can, that these projects are in progress, and there's a, like, five-year payment cycle to do all of this work, because it contributes to energy savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=510.136s">So</a> that's the first three here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=511.776s">That's</a> these first three rows right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=517.447s">Um,</a> some other projects that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=522.168s">Sort</a> of shifting gears, we, we made sure we're on the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=525.569s">Um,</a> we have this, um, solar roof and battery project at the Andrews, which is actually a city sponsored project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=536.732s">And</a> it has been in the works for quite some time, um, because it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=542.934s">being</a> completed by the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=545.937s">We</a> don't have a whole lot of information about it and we might need to, perhaps at the next meeting, invite Alicia Hunt or others to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=555.367s">But</a> there were multiple parts of this project at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=560.272s">There</a> was putting solar on the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=562.694s">putting</a> solar batteries in place, and all of that was to help the Andrews Middle School become like an emergency shelter sort of resilience hub for the city, which lacks that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=580.139s">I</a> don't have a tremendous amount of information about that, but that's what that one was. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=583.059s">Our</a> HVAC replacement project is listed here as well for both McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=593.332s">Um,</a> we also then are sort of looking forward to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=599.355s">Um,</a> we will need to do roof rebuilds for McGlynn Elementary, Brooks, Missittuc and Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=607.138s">So</a> all of those schools are sort of at the stage where we need to begin watching, um, roof replacement needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=614.26s">The</a> Andrews has already been replaced as part of, um, that product, the solar roof and battery projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=619.942s">So</a> that updates to the roof had to be done before the solar, um, could even be viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=625.444s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=629.888s">As</a> we talk about HVAC, we know that we will also have HVAC maintenance and replacement work to do at some point in the future around for Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts because all of those systems are as old as the Andrews and McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=646.605s">Um,</a> and, uh, you know, we will, uh, be looking at that and I'll talk, I'll mention recommissioning in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=654.252s">Um,</a> we have, um, some district wide security upgrades on the next, um, on the next row here, uh, right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=664.08s">Um,</a> and then we do have, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=668.595s">Playground</a> renovations potentially at our other three middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=672.819s">So</a> I think everyone knows how amazing the work at the McGlynn was the good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=681.126s">You</a> know, the good thing about that project is that it has really solved a whole host of issues at the McGlynn but <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=691.155s">The</a> McGlynn space is so unique, there's very little that you could sort of envision lifting up and putting in place in some of our other school buildings because the other school buildings just simply don't have playgrounds sized like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=705.37s">So</a> there is some things to think about from a playground innovation perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=712.137s">We</a> also have on this list a front stairwell replacement project, ADA accessibility improvements and gutters for the Curtis Tufts building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=721.961s">We</a> have fire pump control work for McGlynn complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=728.584s">We</a> have the Brooks hot water heater. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=730.405s">This</a> actually update here has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=743.766s">in</a> September, I guess it was October, October 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=748.269s">So</a> that work is in progress now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=752.012s">So</a> that's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=755.094s">We</a> have also on this list, we have parking lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews Complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=761.459s">We</a> have drainage at the field at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=764.861s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=792.869s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=795.535s">And</a> then we have a project to replace the field flashing behind the brick at the McGlynn Elementary that causes rain in the kindergarten classrooms when it is driving sideways rain apparently is the like factor there that sort of causes that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=816.345s">Um,</a> and then we also have, uh, we also put on the list, um, the front Plaza, uh, settling at the McGlynn and the Andrews, um, and some, uh, potential remediation for ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=831.038s">Um,</a> so that was everything on our list, um, as of June of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=836.763s">Any</a> questions about that so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=849.911s">Okay,</a> so the next piece of this is to start to identify, are there other projects that need to be placed on this list that aren't here yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=863.102s">And</a> Dr. Cushing and I met a month or so ago and we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=870.962s">uh,</a> efforts, um, which are consistent with the policy that we pass to make sure that our building leaders and all the buildings, um, participated in this process, um, by, uh, submitting any of their capital needs to us, um, via our new operations hero, um, ticketing system for maintenance and, um, custodial services. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=895.021s">So,</a> um, Dr. Cushing put out a memo and a call to the team to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=902.047s">collect</a> input so that we could add to this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=906.034s">And</a> I will ask him to tell us how that went and what he has to share.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1026.616s">It's</a> the motor, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1133.982s">So,</a> Peter, is the request at all schools?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1141.564s">And</a> the grant is specific to the McLean MHS, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.525s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.725s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.945s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1145.365s">And</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1196.702s">Um,</a> so we have $1.9 million as a cost estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1201.926s">Is</a> that does that include locks soup to nuts? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1207.95s">That</a> includes everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1209.151s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1210.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1211.701s">And</a> the grant funding did not come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1213.741s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1252.599s">Yes,</a> Member Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1314.813s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1319.477s">So</a> Peter, the new things that you, I just want to make sure that I got them as you were talking because that's first I was listening and then I was like, oh wait, I'm the note taker. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1327.762s">I</a> should start writing some things down. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1329.263s">So</a> I wanted to make sure I got them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1332.045s">So</a> with the bike racks, the door sweeps, the freight elevator motor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1336.548s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1340.458s">Did</a> I miss anything?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1477.035s">Dr.</a> Cushing, when you said it's included in the HVAC project, do you mean just at McGlynn and Andrews?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1527.872s">Sorry,</a> I'm just going to make some notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1530.074s">Here</a> we go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1615.438s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1617.439s">So</a> Peter, for that project, is the estimate still $20,000, or is it something different?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1680.356s">So</a> remember, Reinfeld, the other thing that is that is being actively bundled with the HVAC project is this recommissioning process that we've talked about a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1693.688s">So</a> that is something that is being bundled in with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1697.01s">And</a> what what recommissioning is going to tell us is how much light do we have left on the roof? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1704.457s">how</a> much life do we have left in the HVAC system and those kinds of things, as well as like smaller, easier things to address and fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1712.1s">So</a> the team was working on a proposal for that piece of the work around recommissioning for all of the buildings outside of McGlynn and Andrews, except for MHFs and Curtis Tufts, so Brooks, Missituk, Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1730.174s">Um,</a> and that would be included in that work and in that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1733.677s">I</a> think from a city perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1736.919s">The,</a> I think the mayor and the council broadly know that the HVAC replacement is going to cost $20M. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1742.604s">Um,</a> the exact costs I think are still very much being refined and defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1750.089s">Um,</a> and so the funding source of that in terms of how it'll be paid for, I think still is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1755.635s">technically</a> uncommitted because we're just not like ready to do that, to take that step just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1763.58s">And</a> so I think the one question is like what really should be bundled in there when it comes to like the networked closets and the roof placements, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1775.268s">So</a> certainly if you're going to, I think that's a question for us and maybe a question to ask Alicia if we are able to have her join us next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1785.655s">Is</a> really to think about if we're thinking about McGlynn and McGlynn complex and Andrews, um, we should be thinking about all of these parts as part of that bid, um, where the other schools, Brooks, Mr. Chuck Roberts may need to be in a subsequent planned round where, um, we do the recommissioning first and then it sort of leads us from a priority perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1815.523s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1816.544s">That</a> makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1818.205s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1819.746s">So</a> I'm just trying to Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1831.348s">Peter,</a> has the roof been officially deemed as part of the scope for the McGlynn, or not yet?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2197.972s">On</a> the topic of hot water heaters, do we have other hot water heaters that are in need of replacement? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2205.931s">So</a> end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2207.332s">I</a> thought this was the last one to go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2537.344s">Members,</a> so?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2640.583s">Okay,</a> let's do that another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2642.224s">Let's</a> just worry about the list.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2655.436s">Yeah,</a> so as you've been talking, what I've been trying to do is <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2660.934s">Um,</a> let's create some buckets here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2662.935s">Um,</a> certainly the top bucket is the stuff that's in progress and and funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2667.737s">Um,</a> and so the HVAC project is up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2671.439s">Uh,</a> exactly how it's funded, how it will be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2675.7s">I</a> don't think we know that yet, but we do know that it's on the radar and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2681.923s">You</a> know, being planned for so that's everything up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2685.546s">The</a> Brooks hot water heater is I did move that up here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2688.708s">So</a> that's this top piece of, like, here's what's in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2692.551s">And</a> moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2695.965s">down</a> here is all the the rest of it i guess i would say i would call it and i grouped these three things um the roof rebuild the networked closet mini split replacements and the recommissioning assessment i put that on here as its own line item as the things that um are not committed yet but have been talked about as sort of part and parcel to that um that larger h back project so <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2724.443s">I</a> will work with Peter and Alicia to determine between now and our next meeting, can those things move above the line and be bundled, or is there something else that has to happen for that to be effective, or does it have to come into the rest of the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2743.232s">That</a> is maybe a different grouping than this next group, which based on what we were talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2753.044s">Sounded</a> to me like the most urgent imminent things that we would be talking about prioritizing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2763.234s">And</a> then the last grouping. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2765.885s">Is</a> the things to plan for future many of which all of this stuff in particular is to be validated during recommissioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2773.933s">So</a> not ready to do it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2777.016s">I</a> did put district wide security upgrades down here for next year based on the feedback about the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2785.121s">The</a> playground renovations are down here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2788.582s">They're</a> on the radar parking lot, parking lot paving, and then the ADA plaza remediation, the settling remediation, and the district-wide electrification enablement assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2804.347s">I</a> guess the first question, member Rousseau, member Reinfeld, do any of the things on this bottom chunk belong in the middle as we should be doing this this year?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2846.223s">Well,</a> Dr. Cushing, do you have a sense of the scope of this project?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2934.038s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2936.59s">Okay,</a> can we maybe take a to-do to talk to Paul Riggi about that to get a better assessment of what we might be looking at?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3031.486s">Because</a> the question is, can that be bundled or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3036.427s">So</a> by the time we have our next meeting, I think we can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3040.768s">And</a> I will invite Alicia as well to join us if she would like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3046.489s">But</a> I will try to get the answer in the meantime anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3051.13s">So</a> maybe more to come on that one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3083.631s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3091.798s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3092.658s">The</a> other two items that were in this like near range situation were the door sweeps, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3101.926s">And</a> if you had any sense of what <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3105.489s">That</a> number is and the other 1 is about the drainage at the Brooks field and I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3117.051s">I</a> will mention that when that field was put in, we were promised that maintenance would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3121.334s">So</a> I actually am going to be critical about that, that we were promised that that would happen, and it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3128.879s">We</a> also were imminently promised that the drainage was going to be fixed, and it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3133.342s">And</a> my kids are in high school and eighth grade now, and they were in third grade at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3139.606s">So</a> we do have to get back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3146.272s">I'm</a> just trying to look through my email because John may have sent me something about that, but Peter, I will let you answer as well about the door.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3177.023s">The</a> issue at the Brooks is the hill and the water comes like it sort of runs down the hill and spills onto the field.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3213.677s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3317.45s">So</a> that would be, I think, may be helpful for our next meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3321.011s">And</a> then I was just looking in my email to see if I ever got <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3327.485s">Uh,</a> a quote from John about the drainage project, and I'm not seeing it, but I don't know, Peter, you have that or if we need to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3458.52s">So</a> I just separated that into two lines so that we have both of them on the list.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3469.643s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3471.724s">So</a> I think this middle group is the group that we, a, we need to try to get some better pricing to understand where these projects are at. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3480.927s">And</a> then B, um, we'll ultimately need to sort of prioritize and recommend, um, the go forward path on in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3493.431s">Does</a> that sound right to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3494.852s">Is</a> there anything else that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3501.502s">listed</a> here that should move up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3586.306s">I</a> just put in maybe we can circle back and talk about that next time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3662.923s">Well,</a> there's four pillars that are eligible for CPC funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3669.306s">One</a> of them is affordable housing, so that broadly doesn't apply to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3673.556s">Um,</a> then there's like historic restoration, open space, and I'm forgetting the fourth tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3683.726s">I</a> think it's recreation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3716.167s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3719.236s">Um,</a> so members, so I think this spreadsheet actually gets us to all of those places just in a different version. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3729.59s">If</a> we can add this net school spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3733.237s">piece</a> on and I think Noel that may be something that I can work with you on offline to tag these as whether or not they are sort of inclusive in that school spending or excluded from. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3753.407s">So</a> we can do that before the next meeting as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3802.805s">Yeah,</a> so I will share this with Noel after we're done here and ask that that be added to before our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3821.874s">Are</a> there any other projects that you all have on your mind that haven't made this list just yet?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3903.178s">I'll</a> do dinner in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3905.539s">I</a> think we can certainly update this once we hear from the afterschool program, if there's a capital need there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3912.821s">Or</a> it might just be building in grounds.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3922.104s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3923.365s">Hopefully</a> not a capital need, but I hope not, but it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3929.366s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3931.287s">So</a> we can circle back to that at our next meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3936.348s">Is</a> there anything else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3983.325s">So</a> I think maybe we can get some details about the like evolving scope of that project, which sounds like it's everything in the kitchen sink in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3991.728s">Um,</a> and then, um, we can, we can update it if necessary, but, um, I think the other, you know, the recommissioning process will also tell us whether that's an option for, um, the outside buildings.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4049.623s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4100.003s">Yeah,</a> and I think the other thing that is the consideration when we get to feasibility is do the administrative offices stay at the high school or do they get relocated and to a place like Curtis Tufts is always sort of something that is a possibility as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4121.62s">Because</a> the administrative offices, if I'm remembering correctly, generally are not reimbursable under MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4127.505s">So</a> to rebuild the administrative offices, we would have to pay in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4132.19s">So</a> that may be a good way to change the use of that space instead of shutting it down completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4142.739s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4151.064s">Any</a> other changes that people think we should make this evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4161.018s">The</a> agenda for our next meeting is exactly the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4165.4s">It's</a> to continue this conversation so that we can agree amongst this group what we're going to recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4175.484s">And</a> then that will go to a committee of the whole in December, where we will walk through what this is and what is on here and formalize a recommendation from the school committee that will be shared with <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4189.13s">The</a> mayor and obviously may will be there, but the mayor and the council in terms of funding needs and so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4198.894s">At</a> a capital level, we can plan accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4203.515s">So,</a> I think we can make a motion to continue this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4207.037s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4213.919s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4217.779s">Is</a> there a motion to continue the meeting?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4229.482s">It's</a> the 19th of November. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4231.502s">The</a> 19th of November, correct.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.904s">Five.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4241.225s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4243.045s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4244.105s">There's</a> a motion on the floor to continue the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4247.156s">I'll</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4248.736s">Second</a> by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4251.677s">I</a> will take a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4252.798s">So</a> Member Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4254.498s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4255.658s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4256.959s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4257.779s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4258.359s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4259.46s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4262.24s">The</a> meeting is continued until November 19th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.623s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-10-09_FlpU2zCH-mk/2024-10-09_FlpU2zCH-mk.html">Jenny Graham Campaign Kickoff Remarks</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=0.109s">As</a> importantly, thank you everybody else who's here because you all are the reason why we do the work that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=7.968s">This</a> is a historic moment for Medford Public Schools, and it's one that we have to soak in and really take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=15.875s">When</a> I ran for office in 2019, which is 100 dog years ago, it seemed like part of the reason I ran is because I would go to school committee meetings, and the hard questions about what do we need and don't have, those questions never were asked, and they certainly weren't answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=34.15s">That</a> is one of the many reasons why I ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=37.132s">Once</a> I got elected and I started on the school committee, we started having budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=41.635s">The</a> first thing I said was, what is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=43.636s">How</a> does this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=44.376s">How</a> do we know what we need versus how do we know how much we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=48.298s">There</a> were a lot of blank stares in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=50.039s">There</a> were a lot of people who were like, what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=54.102s">I</a> said, how do we know what we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=56.463s">does</a> it just always magically match every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=59.764s">And</a> everyone sort of said, yeah, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=63.166s">And</a> I said, okay, well, if you talk to the community, they talk a lot about what we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=67.488s">So</a> this can't be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=70.889s">So</a> from that moment on, I've been on a quest to be more intentional about describing the budget in terms of what we would need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=79.933s">That</a> year in the middle of the onset of COVID, we started simple and we just said to the department heads, what are three to five things you could do that would improve student outcomes? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=92.125s">How</a> much did the list cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=95.348s">Anybody,</a> any guesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=97.851s">You</a> know, any guesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=102.566s">not</a> that much, but $10 million, a cool $10 million without a lot of strategic thinking, without a lot of time to really think deeply about that question because they were also in the middle of shutting down school and trying to figure out this virtual learning thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=118.938s">So</a> a cool $10 million just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=122.661s">Ever</a> since then, we have taken more strategic approaches to get to that same question, and it changes a little bit every year how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=129.367s">But</a> the answer is always about $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=132.73s">The</a> answer of what we need and don't have is always significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=138.655s">And</a> it's changed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=140.017s">So</a> we aren't talking about needing Chromebooks for every student anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=143.159s">We</a> were in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=144.981s">That's</a> changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=146.081s">Now</a> we're talking about we need money to replace those Chromebooks that we bought in 2020 because it's not an option to not have technology anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=154.505s">So</a> as I think about this work that we're doing, I'm excited to let people be free to really think about what could improve student outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=166.789s">What</a> do we need that we don't have? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=169.69s">And</a> this moment is a huge start. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=174.912s">If</a> you were paying attention this spring, you know that the budget was bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=179.115s">It</a> was dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=181.116s">The</a> MPS administration was asked to lay out sort of what would it take to meet the city's available allocation and they laid out a devastating list of cuts and we were still 2.7 million dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=194.304s">away</a> from that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=196.786s">So</a> when you talk about 2.7 million more dollars, nothing is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=202.85s">Class</a> size, athletics, extracurriculars, buses, the arts, the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=208.613s">2.7</a> million dollars is a big, big number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=211.375s">And</a> that's in addition to all of the other cuts that they could lay out for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=217.336s">I'm</a> super grateful that my fellow finance task force members voiced their unwavering support when I said, we can't live through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=226.359s">This</a> is too deep for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=230.24s">And</a> we were able to work with the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=234.801s">I'm</a> grateful to every city department that ratcheted back what they wanted out of the budget so that <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=240.762s">the</a> situation at Medford Public Schools could be a little less bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=244.064s">And</a> that's what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=245.064s">It</a> was less bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=246.885s">I'm</a> also grateful for one-time funds because that all allowed us to do some things in a stopgap way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=254.488s">We</a> were able to save two literacy interventionists, four department heads, three behavior specialists, one nurse, two elementary school teachers, and a facilities maintenance budget that was a little less anemic than in years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=267.034s">So</a> that's what we did with one-time funds, but that's one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=270.917s">That</a> means that all of those things are on the chopping block again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=277.061s">There's</a> no more one-time funds to fill this void. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=281.684s">So</a> let's talk about November because that's actually a more fun thing to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=286.433s">We're</a> going to do two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=287.754s">The</a> first thing we're going to do is stabilize the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=290.416s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=291.857s">We're</a> going to stop the potential of that hole that we've created with one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=299.801s">We're</a> going to close that gap and we're going to close it for good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=303.503s">Those</a> critical staff members I just talked about, we're going to put them in a position where they can continue to support our students the way that they need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=311.528s">The</a> stabilizing money will also fund our technology replacement budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=315.251s">It's</a> 2024, and it's not an option to not have technology anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=320.416s">It</a> will also allow us to restore an administrative assistant at the McGlynn School, where we have one administrative assistant managing two school buildings and supporting two principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=328.622s">It's</a> a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=329.863s">And</a> she's going to do it, and she's going to be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=332.566s">But</a> that is a stopgap situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=335.808s">So</a> we're looking forward to being able to do something to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=339.252s">And</a> it will also this stabilization money will ensure that we never have to find out what that $2.7 million would actually look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=347.317s">So</a> that's one thing we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=348.378s">We're</a> going to stabilize the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=349.819s">We're</a> going to stop doing this one time thing where we don't have enough to even get by. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=356.826s">yay</a> but as importantly we're going to invest in the future so we're going to do more than just run in place we are going to do more and the list of possibilities is long and you probably all have your own list of what you think is possible or what you think <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=379.442s">would</a> be useful and so I brought my list just to give you a flavor of what was I thinking about when I sat in those meetings and we arrived at these numbers where we were going to ask for the community to bring seven million more dollars to MPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=394.093s">So</a> here's a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=395.895s">Our</a> vocational students deserve access to the arts and AP classes and they shouldn't have to take Spanish or any other language online because the schedule is simply incompatible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=405.842s">That</a> is what happens today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=409.389s">Fixing</a> it is a huge undertaking and it's gonna change the structure of the school day and the schedule for every single student at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=416.233s">So</a> it's a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=418.574s">All</a> of our students deserve more time for learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=421.475s">We</a> have the shortest school day around and it's time for Medford to do more than the minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=429.979s">More</a> students deserve access to transportation because two miles is too far to walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=439.184s">It</a> doesn't matter how old you are, that's a long walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=443.348s">Our</a> staff deserve investment in high quality professional development and support as they develop their craft as educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=450.976s">Our</a> paras deserve a living and competitive wage and so do our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.004s">This</a> is a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.924s">We've</a> made a lot of progress for our paraprofessionals, but there's so much to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=462.467s">Our</a> athletes, our extracurricular participants, they deserve the very best opportunities we can provide, and that starts with increasing our coaching and advisor stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=472.613s">They</a> have not been addressed in a decade or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=476.835s">They</a> are fractional compared to the time that our advisors and our coaches put into our students, and we need to do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=486.102s">Our</a> buildings deserve maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=489.952s">It's</a> the most boring thing, but it's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=493.835s">The</a> project to replace the HVAC system at McGlynn and Andrews is $20 million alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=499.938s">$20</a> million. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=501.279s">So</a> that project is ongoing, but $20 million will be spent on that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=507.924s">And</a> that's just so that those buildings can have acceptable HVAC systems, and it's not too hot to learn in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=518.67s">just</a> this morning I got a list of immediate repair needs that are happening that are happening across the district as we prepare for the start of school it was a cool half million dollars right there so the need across the school our buildings are all new but they're aging our buildings are new but they're 20 years old and that means their their systems are at the end of life so we have to be prepared to do something different than we've done all along <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=543.625s">we</a> have to maintain what we have so we don't have to do this again because I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=550.068s">Certainly</a> the Medford High School project is a bit of a separate matter than what we're talking about tonight if anyone wants to have if anyone has questions about the Medford High building project please let me know I'm happy to answer them after this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=562.013s">So</a> the list goes on that's my list I've probably already spent seven million dollars so I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=568.376s">And</a> I know we all have a list, and I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=573.159s">So</a> when we do this in November, the next thing that happens is we start talking about now what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=580.324s">What</a> is the plan, and how are we going to best use this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=583.546s">And</a> I want to see all of you at that table. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=585.867s">That's</a> a very public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=587.669s">It</a> happens on the floor, out in the open, in the light of day, so that we can hear from people about what those priorities are and what they think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=595.934s">But</a> first, we have to get there.<h2><a href="../2024-10-09_S1kX6bu_Ul8/2024-10-09_S1kX6bu_Ul8.html">Invest in Medford Community Forum - 10/8/24</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=167.756s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=168.356s">I'm</a> Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=169.797s">I'm</a> the vice chair of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=172.339s">This</a> is my fifth year on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=175.861s">So</a> I started January 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=178.222s">And</a> I am really excited about this very historic opportunity for us to do what we've been talking about for five years as we have navigated <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=193.294s">Terrible</a> budgets for our schools and our kids and really to say to the community that we are asking the community to tell us that they value education as much as that they have told us for the last 5 budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=208.751s">So</a> I'm super excited about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=212.435s">I</a> think there's a lot of questions out out in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=216.44s">I'm</a> so happy that you're all here and hopefully we can answer some of those most pressing questions as we go tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=223.829s">So</a> I will turn it over to Paul.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=719.974s">start</a> and Paul, please add to. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=724.858s">So</a> I think there's a couple of things that we we know for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=728.68s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=729.021s">So</a> we know that in last year's budget, we relied on one time funds to prevent some of the cuts that were articulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=740.489s">So</a> if you were following the last budget season, the <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=746.934s">The</a> CFO and our budget, our now budget director, Gerry McCue, was directed to make the budget lean because we knew that we were coming off of our ability to use ESSER funds, which are COVID-related relief funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=767.251s">And</a> we knew that the budget was going to be tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=773.366s">He</a> laid out a series of cuts, essentially, that were very unpopular and unfavorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=784.415s">And</a> they included things like two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists who work with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=796.921s">1</a> nurse, 4 teachers, 4 department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=800.924s">So</a> those positions alone are worth like 1.1 million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=807.387s">He</a> laid out obviously more than 1.1 million dollars worth of cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=812.891s">He</a> laid out, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.3 million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=817.853s">In</a> cuts, some of the cuts actually happened, but thanks to the finance task force working with me and the mayor, we were able to get agreement that we would use some 1 time funds from the city in order to make the whole, like, not so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=838.959s">So,</a> the, the cuts that Jerry laid out in terms of what the. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=843.3s">Possibilities</a> were were sort of deep and devastating. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=846.881s">And</a> he was also articulating at that time that there was still $2.7 million of a gap between what the city thought the budget could possibly be and what. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=861.954s">we</a> felt like was needed to avoid cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=864.856s">So</a> all the positions that he talked about lost 2.7 million more dollars were on the table in cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=873.241s">We</a> saved many of those cuts from based on some of the one-time funds and really at the expense of many other city departments who had to go back and slim back their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=885.428s">And</a> that's a recurring theme in Medford where <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=889.19s">the</a> school costs are accelerating I would say more quickly than sort of anywhere else in the city's budget and what I've seen in the last five years is that when something more than two and a half percent is able to come to the schools it's at the expense of another city department and there's there's just no more for the city departments to cut or give it's why the DPW <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=914.369s">Is</a> struggling to handle our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=918.173s">It's</a> why we almost didn't have Saturdays in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=922.477s">Like,</a> all of those things come because there's just the pie is only so big for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=927.561s">And</a> there's only so much that we can do to direct money to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=931.785s">And</a> it is happening at the expense of all the other things that we would like to see in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=936.93s">So</a> this year we were able to plug part of the whole with one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=942.834s">It</a> was about $1.75 million in one-time funds and additional money that came at the expense of other city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=952.34s">So</a> what we know for sure is that that $1.75 million is not available next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=959.505s">That's</a> the sort of very definition of one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=962.347s">So</a> we know that there will be cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=967.029s">If</a> these overrides don't pass, because there, there just is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=971.831s">Nowhere</a> else to to collect that money from so we certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=976.493s">Could</a> imagine that we might get a 2 and a half percent increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=981.634s">Like,</a> 90, something percent of our costs are fixed either by contract or by things like our utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=989.434s">They're</a> all accelerating faster than 2 and a half percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=992.636s">So</a> there's just no, there's no wiggle room there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=994.597s">There's,</a> there's no room to say, but we want to keep these extra people. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=998.178s">So</a> we know that that will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1000.88s">What</a> exact positions are very much that's sort of the ugly question we will grapple with if we. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1007.503s">Um,</a> don't see these override succeed and so is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1010.724s">1</a> nurse or 2 nurses is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1013.485s">2</a> behavior specialists or 3, all of those would be questions we'd be sort of asking and answering in the next budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1020.748s">Um,</a> but we also, we know that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1025.069s">are</a> not doing things today that we have to do, like maintain our technology, whether that's Chromebooks, laptops for teachers, any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1035.138s">We</a> know we're not doing that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1037.32s">And</a> if we don't do that next year, we will no longer have technology for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1043.365s">And</a> as we look to what we need to educate students, <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1048.462s">Technology</a> is on the must have list so that means that that money that half 1Million dollars that we need for technology next year would have to come from somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1057.97s">So</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1059.752s">In</a> our budget, 80 ish, 85% of our costs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1065.257s">For</a> staff, so when you talk about cutting the budget, there's just very little that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1072.782s">discretionary</a> in any way, unless you consider staff discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1077.064s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1078.804s">But</a> we would be looking at some very, very difficult decisions were it to come to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1085.347s">And</a> we've done that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1087.668s">And</a> it's ugly each and every time we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1093.09s">And</a> we are the only city department since I have started that has said goodbye to humans who work in our department. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1100.233s">So</a> other departments have seen cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1102.934s">They've</a> seen sort of flatlining, but we have said goodbye to people who work in our district in service to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1111.839s">And</a> there would be more of that before there would be less if the overpits don't pass.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1476.006s">Yeah,</a> so a couple of things that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1479.848s">Eliminate</a> this year, our director of data reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1485.53s">Was</a> eliminated by. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1490.365s">Six,</a> five or six, I'm not remembering exactly, administrative assistant positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1496.984s">were</a> eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1499.045s">There's</a> at least one of them is on high on my list personally to come back because the McGlynn complex is working with one administrative assistant right now for a thousand kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1511.873s">That's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1514.714s">That</a> is a huge, it's a huge ask and a big lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1518.297s">So</a> there are some administrative assistant positions that we could look at to say what needs to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1526.437s">Literacy</a> interventionists, we. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1530.299s">We're</a> able to bring, I think, 3 back into the budget, but we needed 4. we only have 2 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1536.822s">We</a> do have 1 open position. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1539.384s">Um,</a> and then there were, um, there ended up being 1 elimination from the administrators union. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1547.73s">Um,</a> so I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1551.032s">Think</a> that's like, super high on our list because the work has been distributed, but that would certainly be subject of a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1558.538s">Um,</a> and then there were some changes to the portfolio of, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1566.336s">of</a> teachers at each of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1569.058s">And</a> that number change, you know, whatever, whatever we talked about in May, and then in June, and what actually transpired at the start of the year is very much a function of like how the enrollment comes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1581.584s">So</a> I do think there are some classrooms that are bigger than they have historically done. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1587.306s">And</a> we're sort of always watching those class sizes because <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1593.534s">Once</a> you put too many kids in a classroom, it becomes incredibly hard for all the kids to get what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1599.599s">And</a> we would be looking at that and maybe able to return to some of those other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1605.884s">But</a> there's a whole bunch of other things that we've never been able to talk about doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1610.667s">And</a> I know that representatives from our teachers union was at, were at one of our early meetings this year asking us to address the overcrowding issues at the Roberts Elementary School specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1623.717s">There</a> is no more space at that school and we continue to see enrollment climb. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1630.038s">So</a> there are other things that we are going to have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1634.539s">So</a> they may not be about like bringing back a position that was cut, but talking about finally being able to fund a position that's always been needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1644.462s">So</a> that those two things are both possibilities for this when we pass this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1672.961s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1675.234s">A</a> couple of so question 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1678.796s">Provides</a> us an opportunity to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1681.618s">What</a> we should do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1683.359s">Like,</a> what what have we never been able to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1685.381s">We</a> should do and we actually have been having this conversation in budget seasons for as long as I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1694.307s">And</a> there's a shortage of good ideas about things that would benefit students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1700.013s">But</a> the things that are sort of, I'll say highest on the list are things like living wages for all of our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1708.901s">And</a> so when I say a living wage, I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1714.179s">raising</a> people up out of the minimum wage category, where many of our positions have existed for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1722.605s">We've</a> made a lot of progress in moving out of that minimum wage territory, but we are not yet at what is considered a living wage for somebody who lives in this area and works in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1736.974s">We</a> also, and like, 1 of the biggest and most important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1742.695s">For</a> our district is to finish the integration of our high school and our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1749.176s">So,</a> the 2 schools used to operate completely separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1752.057s">They</a> were listed as 2 different schools with the Department of elementary and secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1757.998s">They</a> were merged. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1759.678s">Some</a> years ago, 6, 7 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1763.797s">But</a> the two schedules were never integrated in such a way that students could move seamlessly between the two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1773.32s">That's</a> very complicated work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1776.701s">We</a> have been at it for a good number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1779.923s">I</a> think we finally are at the place where we have a path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1785.284s">And</a> that will allow things like our vocational students to have space in their schedule to access <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1793.107s">Um,</a> the arts or world language, my daughter is in the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1799.169s">Um,</a> now she's a 10th grader in the robotics and engineering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1803.93s">She</a> has to take Spanish in line after school to meet her world language requirement because there's no space in her schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1811.572s">For</a> Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1814.398s">All</a> of that gets fixed with changes to the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1818.601s">And</a> it's a very complicated set of changes because we still have to and want to preserve what makes our vocational school so unique and special. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1829.367s">We</a> have students who come out who are halfway to licensure, who are like a year ahead of their peers coming out of high school, going into certain trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1840.013s">All</a> of that requires a completely different schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1843.034s">So</a> the integration of the two schedules is critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1846.994s">It's</a> going to change the structure of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1849.575s">It's</a> going to change the amount of time that happens in class A versus class B versus class C. And all of that contributes to, you know, reexamining as we begin negotiations with our teachers, like what the contract is, what the requirements are, and what the costs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1871.272s">Relatedly,</a> when you think about all the rest of the schools in the district, universally, our instructional time is at the minimum that the state allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1882.358s">So</a> when we think about how much time we spend educating kids and what opportunities we're able to provide them, there's no wiggle room. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1892.083s">There's</a> probably many, many reasons why we don't call a late <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1896.897s">For</a> those of you who are parents and you're like, why don't we do a 2 hour delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1900.599s">There's</a> actually probably many reasons, but 1 of the reasons is because we don't have 2 hours to spare. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1907.043s">So,</a> we either have to bring the kids in for a whole day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1909.985s">Or</a> we're not meeting our instructional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1912.846s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1914.627s">Looking</a> at. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1916.048s">The,</a> the nature and structure and lengths of the school day are all things that become possible when we are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1924.115s">Also,</a> simultaneously talking about cutting staff, because if you think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1929.215s">How</a> your elementary school student moves through their day, for example, they, they have their core classes and they have their specials. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1936.678s">That</a> whole, like, the whole dynamic might need to shift in order to be able to spend another. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1942.02s">You</a> know, 5 minutes a day on something like math and that then may require additional specialists to be able to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1950.563s">students</a> in the building because every class changes so there's any number of ways that plays out in practice and we have to we obviously have to you know get with our partners in the union and sort of talk through all the nitty-gritty details of that but the way school day happens is going to change and in order for that to be possible it's very likely we're going to be asking teachers to do something different than they do today <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1978.94s">And</a> therefore, like, we need the sort of financial space to be able to have a productive conversation about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2548.717s">Just</a> quickly to say yes to around the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2552.379s">We're</a> several years away from that question being on the table for the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2560.805s">The</a> money that we are required to set aside for the early stages of that project have been set aside by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2569.03s">So</a> in so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2571.812s">When</a> we talk about free cash, 1 of the things that happened back in June was an allocation of some of the free cash money, about 3M dollars to be ready for those early stages of so that is provided for. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2584.615s">But</a> there's many steps that will go through before we get to a point of being being in a position to ask about that debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2593.457s">1</a> of the things that's very interesting, there's lots of documentation on the school building committee website. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2599.061s">If</a> you want to know more about that project, all of the deliverables that we have submitted are out there with the exception of some of our. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2608.649s">Some</a> of our enrollment projection information, and I found that part of the exercise very enlightening because they did ask us to talk about future development and we talked. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2618.396s">You</a> know, and we talked about in reference in partnership with the city, things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2622.378s">Projects</a> in Medford square in project over the air rights in Wellington and some of the bigger sort of coming attractions and I will follow up with the communications director to make sure that those documents get out there because. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2636.586s">I</a> think where they landed is pretty digestible to the public and just to understand where that falls in relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2644.77s">to</a> some of these plans that we're talking about here from a development perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2648.571s">They're</a> real, they're coming, there's RFPs going out and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2651.912s">But</a> also, what effect and impact does that have on the size of the eventual Medford High School?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2673.786s">Sure,</a> we so we're in the very 1st stage of the project, which is called the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2681.577s">Um,</a> our, our eligibility phase started on May 1st and by July 10th, all of our deliverables were in, which usually takes about 6 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2690.669s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2691.77s">Um,</a> we crushed through that in about 2 and a half months instead of 6. and so we are waiting now for, um, to finalize the process with MSBA, where we agree on how big of a population of students we're building a building for once that happens and they get back with us after they've done their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2713.416s">will</a> move into the next phase, which is where we would hire the owner's project manager and ultimately the architect who will help conduct the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2724.904s">So</a> that's where that feasibility study money comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2727.946s">The</a> feasibility study has to be completed in order to then have any sort of a spec that would be able to go out to debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2735.831s">So</a> it's not five to seven years away. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2738.033s">I</a> hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2740.114s">We</a> have students in the building to 7 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2744.056s">I</a> certainly am pushing for that, but we're probably a couple years down the road before a debt exclusion before we're ready to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4130.64s">If</a> you have high school students, you know that this is desperately. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4134.482s">A</a> long time coming, like I said earlier, my daughter is in the robotics and engineering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4143.066s">She</a> takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4144.947s">There's</a> no opportunity for her to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4147.768s">An</a> art class, which is the other sort of half of her brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4150.429s">So</a> she struggles with that, but she takes Spanish online because there's no space in her schedule to take a language, which is a graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4158.512s">And</a> certainly, if you are thinking about pursuing a 4 year college experience after high school, they want to know that you have some sort of full language for some number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4170.356s">So,</a> to answer the question, there is the changing the schedule is a huge undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4176.158s">We</a> are doing everything we can on the administrative side to be as ready as we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4185.561s">Before</a> we are able to sort of have this productive conversation with with our teachers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4191.857s">which</a> hopefully can happen quickly once these questions are successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4196.278s">So</a> there are some sort of like, I'll call them drop dead dates in the mix, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4201.58s">So</a> the high school students have to pick their schedule by like, say mid April, which would mean if you sort of back up from there, the offering and the new schedule would have to be ready in enough time to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4219.426s">Build</a> everything so that students could pick their schedule in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4223.25s">So</a> we really are looking at a very tight window, but the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4230.699s">Is</a> working really hard to make this a reality for next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4234.943s">I.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4237.159s">I</a> think they think it's a huge amount of work and I think they are concerned about the viability of getting to that, that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4244.286s">What</a> I have said is we can't wait another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4247.269s">Another</a> class of kids can't wait for this to go another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4252.854s">So,</a> I personally am really pushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4256.877s">that</a> this override passes, obviously we will have the opportunity to invest some resource in making this a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4264.002s">And</a> obviously we have to go through the negotiating process and we are talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4271.707s">I'm</a> sure the teachers union is talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4274.889s">I</a> want those conversations to be collaborative and productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4279.452s">And</a> in saying that, that also means everybody's sort of ready and prepared for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4285.136s">And</a> so part of what <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4287.137s">I'm</a> asking of the school administration is that they get ready and prepared about all the things that have to happen to make the schedule a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4294.682s">But</a> I am very hopeful that if these pass, we will see maybe not like the final, final, final change by fall of next year, but hopefully pretty darn close. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4307.69s">Hopefully</a> next year your students won't have to take a foreign language online. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4314.178s">But</a> there's a lot of work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4317.24s">Everybody</a> knows that there's a lot of work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4319.481s">And</a> I think if you talk to anybody, any high school student, if you talk to parents of high school students, if you talk to teachers in the high school, like we've sort of all known this has to happen for any number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4334.471s">And</a> the time is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4337.373s">So</a> we're going to push on that as best we can to make that a reality for fall.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4353.926s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4508.035s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4509.576s">Actually,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4511.053s">with</a> Paul's help, hopped in the time machine and went back through our school budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4519.159s">And</a> to see like, do we, you know, to answer the question, like, do we defund the schools ever? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4524.643s">And</a> the answer is basically no. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4527.705s">So</a> there are years where we've flatlined the budget of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4531.208s">So</a> like we did for fiscal year 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4533.289s">So</a> we <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4536.463s">gave</a> the schools the same exact appropriation for FY21 as they had for FY20. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4542.308s">That</a> is effectively a cut in order to make that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4545.511s">We</a> laid off staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4547.212s">So</a> I would call that a flat line, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4549.194s">Like</a> it's effectively a cut, but the dollars from last year and the dollars from this year are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4554.198s">So</a> we have done that, and we have not invested enough, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4560.061s">In</a> our school budget to grow the budget enough to sort of prevent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4566.449s">But</a> I had to go back to, like, the 80s to see a year where the number for this year was lower than the number for last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4576.04s">And</a> I think that was, like, in the middle of the financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4579.364s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4580.695s">Medford</a> certainly does have some history of flatlining the budget or for under investing, but we really don't have a history of defunding the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4592.339s">So</a> that is what would have to happen to, like, move this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4596.74s">We</a> would have to be making choices to defund the school budget a year from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4602.402s">That</a> is not why I do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4605.163s">That</a> is not why people pour their heart and their soul into helping lead our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4611.526s">I'm</a> a no on any proposal that defunds our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4616.588s">I</a> think the council, without exception, would also not agree to defund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4622.551s">So</a> even if it were proposed, <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4625.092s">I</a> don't think there's any support for that and I also don't think having worked with the council and the mayor on the finance task force that anybody even wants to entertain that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4637.202s">The</a> entire premise of this is to do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4639.604s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4641.906s">just</a> maybe rest assured that we don't have even a history of doing this sort of scary thing that is legally possible, but would require an inordinate amount of support to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4654.458s">And</a> there is no support for that concept here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4890.751s">Zach,</a> the only thing I would say is the city put out earlier today a graphic about how we've used ARPA dollars, which I think has been a question that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4903.654s">So</a> check out the city's Facebook page or website to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4909.515s">We</a> have a sort of a deeper dive into question 7 and 8 that are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4915.16s">That</a> is now done sort of almost hot off the presses and I think we can get that out in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4922.066s">So</a> be on the lookout for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4924.628s">Where</a> I'm happy to answer questions offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4929.332s">I</a> know many of you please don't hesitate to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4933.519s">This</a> is such a significant priority for me over the next couple of weeks, because it sets the stage for what the rest of this year becomes, and frankly, for what the future for our students becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4949.328s">So</a> it's a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4951.269s">I'm</a> happy to answer questions any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4954.57s">I</a> will see maybe some of you at Walking Wednesday tomorrow at the Roberts, but grab me any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4963.597s">You</a> have a question, happy to do it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5139.796s">Thanks</a> everyone.<h2><a href="../2024-10-08_f4DKETRRFaY/2024-10-08_f4DKETRRFaY.html">10.7.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10433.796s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10434.836s">Can</a> you tell me a little bit about where the content for Caregiver University comes from? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10440.16s">Like,</a> are we creating content? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10441.862s">Are</a> we buying content?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10499.51s">And</a> is it videos? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10501.671s">Is</a> it actual e-learning? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10504.672s">Is</a> it seminars? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10507.493s">Can</a> I watch this stuff any time? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10510.053s">Or</a> how do I consume it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10607.054s">So</a> I guess what I would like to see is that there's like a central place where all of this content can live. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10615.176s">Like</a> the athletics night is a great example. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10617.316s">It</a> was mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10618.237s">I</a> was unable to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10622.918s">I</a> don't know how I, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10624.955s">address</a> that as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10626.596s">But</a> no one's followed up with me either. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10628.138s">So</a> that would be like an example of, yes, it's in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10632.901s">Yes,</a> you want people to come in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10635.303s">But</a> what, like, what can this platform do for us to make sure that actually the parents who couldn't, I think there might have been a school committee, something at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10645.851s">So</a> who can't come for whatever the reason might be still get the content that is happening in those <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10653.806s">important</a> meetings, because like you said, people are busy, they people need to be able to consume content, sort of when it's convenient for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10660.829s">But</a> I think in some cases, we also need to know that they consumed content, like, every time I register Lucas for sports, there's like 100 pages of waivers, and 100 things I'm supposed to like, view and watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10677.716s">And</a> I actually make an effort to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10680.137s">But</a> it is extremely easy to just <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10683.587s">scroll,</a> scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and click that I have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10688.491s">But</a> if what the district is seeking is like cover, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10694.035s">You</a> know, so if Lucas gets a concussion, like I, you have my signature that I've done something, but there's no evidence that you can point to that I actually did or didn't scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, sign my name and I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.027s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.368s">So</a> I think there's like compliance and <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10713.703s">what</a> we want, you know, from a requirements perspective as we think about all of this going forward, but then there's actually like, did it sink in or did it stick in any way, shape or form? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10726.752s">And</a> was the thing that was really important actually delivered? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10732.356s">And</a> I would argue that when you sign your kids up for sports, that is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10736.318s">Like</a> the thing you needed parents to know when they like rolled out of that sign up, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10743.553s">It's</a> not the takeaway. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10745.975s">The</a> takeaway is, wow, this system is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10748.276s">And</a> it is really tedious and time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10751.619s">And</a> I'm glad that's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10753.24s">So</a> I want to see parents be educated about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10756.923s">And</a> I think parents genuinely want to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10759.224s">But</a> I think we have to do a better job of delivering that content for parents to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10763.767s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can address some of that when we are thinking about the build out of this parent and caregiver university, because I think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10771.795s">it's</a> very needed for all kinds of reasons.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12414.149s">Member</a> Graham, then Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12415.55s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12419.488s">There</a> was some commentary on social media in the last week or so about whether or not the district provides DIBLS results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12430.917s">And</a> the general consensus of the parents was you had to ask for those results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12438.102s">But</a> it doesn't sound like that based on what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12440.824s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand clearly, like, who gets results? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12445.908s">Does</a> everyone get results? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12448.164s">and</a> if not, why not?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12488.477s">And</a> so what does it mean to be at risk? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12491.619s">Like,</a> is there like a threshold? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12497.303s">And</a> is there a reason why we would not <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12499.505s">just</a> give everybody their results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12501.886s">Because</a> basically what's happening on social media is sort of a push to go everybody as individuals to the principal to request the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12510.45s">And</a> that seems like it is going to be far more complicated than if we just gave parents the results that we have.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12593.937s">For</a> two to five?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12604.163s">Got</a> it, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12606.165s">And</a> on this chart where we have in our packet the <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12611.636s">whether</a> schools are title one, how many total students there are, how many reading teachers there are in the grades that the reading teachers are servicing. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12620.06s">Is</a> there a way to add to that chart, like the number of students who are at risk? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12623.882s">Because</a> if you just look at the numbers, there's a huge distribution of how much support is happening in buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12631.705s">And</a> if that's really perfectly aligned with like the number of students who need support, and then there's like even out caseloads, that makes some sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12640.904s">but</a> if you just look strictly at like total population it's hard to understand like are we doing are there enough reading teachers in our district and are they deployed in the right places?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12730.659s">Yeah,</a> and I think I think that breakdown would be helpful and it would be helpful next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12739.517s">for</a> us, like, or, and I'm not even sure that this is the right, like, exact time of year to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.542s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.982s">Maybe,</a> maybe it's like a look back for last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.004s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.945s">But</a> like, whatever the thing is that we land on is like, this is when we're going to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12754.869s">What</a> you would ideally see over time as this curriculum takes hold, right, and matures in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12762.315s">And</a> if we are being successful in our efforts to keep, to do more, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12770.276s">sort</a> of holistic instruction at tier one, there should be fewer students over time who need these services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12777.942s">And</a> it would be ideal to be able to see that in this chart somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12782.926s">So</a> like last year we had a hundred students at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12786.79s">This</a> year we have 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12788.331s">Like,</a> so because, and I know it gets like very wild and complicated when you're talking about all the grades and all the things, but there has to, I feel like one of the things we don't do that well as a district is, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12800.663s">give</a> people a concise way to say, are we making progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12805.025s">So</a> I know that we have talked a lot about moving the need to where the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12809.667s">And</a> so I'm making an assumption that that's why these numbers look so strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12813.769s">Like</a> if you really calculate the math, it intuitively makes sense to me based on what I know about each of those school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12821.593s">But</a> I want the data to actually just make that clear for everybody who just may not tune into these meetings every <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12830.165s">You</a> know, for four or five hours every other Monday night so, so I think there's like a couple of things there from like a historical and data perspective that would be helpful to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12841.983s">As</a> we think about like this work and are we making progress.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12885.519s">And</a> then we know, well, I think that's a good, that's a good question, which is like, when is the right time to have some of these conversations? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12893.245s">This</a> maybe is too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12895.504s">if</a> you want to look at what's happening, like from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, if you don't yet have the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12901.447s">The</a> other thing that's interesting, we were looking at cohort survival models for MSBA enrollment purposes, and it was easy to see a cohort move through the ranks, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12918.737s">So</a> you could see in this year, there were 100 kindergartners, and next year there were <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12924.871s">99</a> first graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12925.691s">And</a> then the year after that, there were 102 second graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12928.654s">So</a> you could sort of see that progression. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12932.356s">And</a> I feel like that is like a really complicated data view. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12935.939s">I</a> don't know if the tools that you're using can provide something like that, but to be able to see a cohort improve over time, I think would actually tell the story that like this all works, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12946.327s">So</a> we had X number of kids in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12948.929s">We</a> had fewer kids in first grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12950.67s">We</a> had fewer kids in second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12952.772s">And</a> by third grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12954.278s">we</a> had even fewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12955.359s">So</a> that's, I think what I would want to see from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12958.701s">And</a> if that means that this is not the right time of year to get this presentation, it's also not my personal goal to make you come to as many school committee meetings as possible to talk about literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12969.248s">So</a> if there's a better time of year for you to come where like a better story is available, like I am all ears for that because this group, this, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12980.734s">meeting</a> has no shortage of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12982.775s">So</a> we just want to make good use of your time and the data that's available.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13408.121s">Can</a> I just say thank you to the Council for moving quickly on this ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13413.483s">It's</a> really important <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13415.703s">that</a> schools have hot water. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13417.304s">I</a> think that goes without saying, but also when you need to spend $267,000, like you need the cooperation of the Council and the Stabilization Fund to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13430.691s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13589.827s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13590.748s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13592.73s">We</a> had a meeting back in March where we discussed a whole series of questions and those questions never quite came like back around to us so I just want to make sure that they do and I also <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13608.847s">would</a> like to be clear about some of these questions and where we are versus where we've been because I've had a number of parents in the last couple weeks tell me we've made no progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13619.355s">I</a> don't actually think that's true, but I believe that that is what it looks like because we don't provide data in a way that allows people to understand what progress looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13628.385s">So</a> I would like to, I'm totally open to when between now and the end of December, you need to be able to provide this report, which is why I didn't put a date, a requested date on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13640.937s">But</a> I do think it's important for us to have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13644.24s">It's</a> a continuing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13646.201s">And</a> some of these questions are really trying to get at what does solving this problem look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13652.808s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13653.621s">that</a> looks different depending on who you talk to, but I think this will help us maybe have a conversation and help the community be part of that conversation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13664.313s">Yes,</a> Dr. Edward-Vincent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13695.327s">Well,</a> what I want to be able to see is if there's 100 kids on the waitlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13699.589s">I</a> don't know if there's 100, but if there's 100, are 99 of them enrolled elsewhere in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13705.893s">Because</a> I think as a community, we have always thought of solving the afterschool problem as a thing that Medford Public Schools has to do on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13714.418s">And</a> thanks to lots of advocacy from lots of parents, there actually are other programs now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13720.344s">They</a> have created other problems for us to solve, which is why I want to know, what is the size and context of the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13726.31s">So</a> I just want to know, if there's 100 kids, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13735.539s">Are</a> they all enrolled somewhere else? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13737.944s">Are</a> they half enrolled somewhere else? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13739.728s">And</a> I know that we have that data because we bused them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13742.734s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand clearly what <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13747.469s">it</a> is that we are trying to solve for. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13750.55s">And</a> if what we're trying to solve for is transportation so that we can continue to promote other programs in our community, like everybody else has for like decades and decades, where we're just sort of starting that process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13765.017s">That's</a> a different solution than continuing to sort of bump up against, is it 80 or 100 kids in a building? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13772.48s">And</a> we keep hearing 100 is too many, but we keep saying, but we do it in one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13777.523s">And</a> we're like around and around the circle, which is fine if what we haven't done is agree on like what the problems are that we're trying to solve. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13788.248s">And</a> I think we're just trying to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13791.569s">So</a> I don't think we've been very targeted in our like solutions and maybe that's okay because it means we're trying like every which way that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13799.847s">I</a> just would like us to be clear and to be able to see the data over time, which I don't think we've really ever been able to do all that well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13810.413s">I'm</a> happy to work with whoever, as they create the report, if there's help I can provide or I'm totally happy to help.<h2><a href="../2024-09-24_dAjG9wnL6rU/2024-09-24_dAjG9wnL6rU.html">9.23.2024 - MSC Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10146.658s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10231.957s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10233.857s">I</a> just want to point out that this committee, several years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10239.848s">made</a> a resolution to make those bus passes free and that the decision to start charging for those again was not brought before this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10249.795s">So</a> as far as I'm concerned, there's a policy compliance issue there because we were very clear that we did not want to charge kids for those bus passes to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10261.523s">I</a> am hopeful that if the overrides are successful, we can immediately institute a change there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10267.321s">I</a> acknowledge that the program as it was originally envisioned may need to change, but if we're talking about transit in compliance with our policy being charged, I'm just overall not in favor of that in any regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10285.136s">But</a> I do wanna point out for everybody who is new, we did this, we said it, we voted on it and it like reappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10292.662s">And</a> that was not a decision by this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10296.738s">we</a> need to get back to addressing that just as soon as there's more than no money in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10303.961s">The</a> other thing I would like to put on the table for the administration to consider is that we should know who is parking in our school and whether we charge for it or not, every person parking in our parking lot, including staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10323.228s">should</a> have to have a parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10325.01s">They</a> should have to be registered with the school with a license plate and a car that they're going to be driving to school without exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10333.221s">And</a> then obviously you deal with visitors sort of separately and there's visitor parking now that's very well signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10339.59s">So...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10340.671s">that</a> should be happening i'm surprised it's not frankly because we have no way of knowing which of those cars are there um in a in a way that is consistent with what we're trying to do in the building so that is maybe a separate issue i would like to hear a report on at some point in time but um it doesn't that that parking permit does not have to come with the fee necessarily um depending on how this vote goes tonight but i i would be absolutely in favor of making sure that we understand <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10369.377s">who</a> is driving cars onto the campus.

absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=433.782s">The</a> minutes are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=437.384s">Okay,</a> so flipping back to our agenda, I just wanted to give you all a couple of updates, and then we have really one topic to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=445.989s">So</a> as you know, when we met back even in July, we talked about... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=453.534s">that</a> all of our documentation had been submitted and that we were awaiting information from the MSBA about the enrollment study. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=462.616s">So</a> we have, since that time, we have met with the MSBA about our enrollment projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=471.498s">So</a> if you all recall, <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=475.72s">That</a> is a critical step in this eligibility phase because what the design enrollment is certified at that we will ultimately agree to with MSBA is how we will go forward to size the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=488.183s">So</a> in terms of any project that comes next, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=494.284s">So</a> that we all have to agree on like how many students are we trying to accommodate for? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=500.145s">We</a> provided a whole bunch of information to them about Medford's housing market. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=505.653s">about</a> our historical enrollment, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=509.575s">And</a> we did hold an enrollment meeting with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=512.977s">They</a> presented us their preliminary numbers and they had a series of really good questions for us about what may not have like, I'll say like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=524.904s">come</a> through in answering the questions that they standardly pose. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=530.305s">So</a> we had a really good conversation about some of the additional factors from Medford's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=537.427s">The</a> mayor is part of the Metro Planning Council, and they are committed to helping the governor achieve their goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=545.188s">We</a> have an aggressive housing production plan, those kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=548.009s">So</a> we were able to have some good conversation about a whole variety of topics that impact enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=554.81s">At</a> the end of the conversation, they asked us for some more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=558.112s">So</a> we actually did provide that to them in mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=562.214s">And</a> we are awaiting feedback from them about the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=565.596s">So</a> more to come on getting through this last piece of the eligibility phase as we hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=576.453s">What</a> we have done in the meantime is thanks to the help of Will Pipicelli, who's on the call, he is replacing Tom Dalton on the committee as soon as the school committee votes that change through officially, but he's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=592.387s">He's</a> joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=593.649s">He's</a> our director of communications for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=596.931s">So</a> I wanted to welcome him to the team unofficially and we'll welcome him officially once the committee... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=602.676s">goes</a> through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=603.777s">But</a> Will and I have been working on two efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=609.38s">One</a> is to take all the documentation that we had to submit to MSBA around this enrollment study and put it into a digestible format. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=619.645s">The</a> other was to do the same with all the maintenance and capital planning information that we had to submit because all of those submissions go into their computer system and they <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=630.051s">don't</a> spit out all that great or with like enough context that it would sort of resonate for us to post that on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=637.716s">So</a> I believe that you all received both of those documents before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=644.701s">That's</a> really just more for you to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=647.603s">We</a> would obviously, we do plan to post those on the website so that everybody can see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=653.747s">But</a> those two documents are hot off the presses. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=657.109s">Will</a> and I were working on finalizing them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=660.351s">Many,</a> many thanks to Will for his work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=665.013s">Pulling</a> together all of the information was not an easy task. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=668.535s">There's</a> lots of attachments. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=670.716s">The</a> enrollment projection information is particularly sort of tedious to... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=676.212s">to</a> get through and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=677.293s">So</a> thank you for that, Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=680.034s">And</a> I want to make sure that you all saw those attachments from Lisa just a little bit ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=686.458s">So</a> take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=687.998s">We</a> will post them on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=689.519s">I</a> will plan to share them out on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=692.201s">And</a> Will and I will talk about a plan to do that from the school account instead of from my personal account so that there can be record of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=701.281s">So</a> I wanted to provide that update. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=702.802s">So</a> we're still very much in wait mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=707.044s">And</a> we are waiting on those next steps from the MSBA and just ready and willing when they have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=716.371s">So</a> I am planning to touch base with our contact there later this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=721.094s">And</a> I will let you know if there's anything material that sort of comes next. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=727.718s">Also,</a> in terms of the timeline, <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=730.764s">Um,</a> I'm not a hundred percent clear when we will sort of exit this phase because we are sort of at, we're at the end, but we're not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=741.311s">So</a> I think some of that will drive, um, the board meeting, um, placement wherever we, um, wherever we land, once we get through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=750.037s">Um,</a> the other, uh, part of the timeline is I haven't scheduled any meetings because I don't want to take up your valuable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=756.501s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=758.317s">until</a> we have better clarity on those next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=762.198s">We</a> will talk a little bit about sort of getting ready for the next phase in just a minute, but we are going to try to use this time to provide some opportunities for folks to go tour other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=773.981s">We</a> do have a tour of Arlington High School on the books for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=777.621s">You're</a> all welcome to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=779.502s">It's</a> at three o'clock on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=782.883s">The</a> Arlington Project is... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=786.992s">probably</a> even more open now than it was when I went to tour the building back in like May or June because it is a phased renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=795.674s">We</a> are also working on plans to talk to Waltham, Somerville, Stoneham, and Bill Ricka. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=808.678s">So</a> more to come as we get those dates on the calendar and Lisa will push out invitations to you all to join us as you are able. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=817.082s">So</a> we're sort of taking this time where we have some quiet time to also take some tours and get inspired. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=824.886s">So</a> that's on the immediate agenda and we'll work through getting those on the books and then we can regroup if there's anywhere else that we want to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=834.45s">Questions</a> about the timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=843.215s">Okay,</a> so the other major part of our agenda today is that as we start sort of looking forward to that next phase, our next, assuming that we are invited to the next phase, which is part of this MSBA process, the next phase really would be for us to... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=865.535s">put</a> out a public procurement and onboard our owner's project manager who will help lead this project forward as it gets increasingly technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=874.697s">So</a> in order to do that under MSBA's guidelines, what we need to do is form an OPM selection committee that will help sort of get that procurement in place and out the door and shepherd that through the selection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=894.919s">There</a> are certain people that have to be on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=897.12s">Fiona</a> is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=898.38s">I</a> believe Bob Dickinson is another. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=901.061s">I</a> think he has to be on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=904.502s">But</a> I did want to talk about that among this group because there is also a gate that the school committee will need to approve whoever that selection committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=915.386s">So</a> even though they're a subcommittee of our committee, according to MSBA, the school committee needs to sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=923.288s">So</a> I wanted to open that up for a little bit of discussion about the sort of our best next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=929.652s">Do</a> we want to nominate folks tonight so that I can sort of be ready to feed that to the school committee when appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=937.577s">Or</a> do we want to do that at a later meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=939.598s">I'm</a> open to both options, but I know the school committee agenda can be sort of big and packed at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=946.382s">So</a> advanced notice would be helpful because then I have a little bit of runway to figure out how to get it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=953.422s">But</a> that team, I believe, can start meeting to start to do the documentation work to put the procurement documents in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=963.836s">So</a> I do think if we sort of have that committee at the ready, they can be moving along because. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=971.089s">the</a> ultimate goal of this next phase is to get the OPM on board and then ultimately the designer or the architect, but the OPM comes first. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=980.412s">So</a> we have to do the OPM and then the architect, and then we can get to ultimately the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=986.313s">So</a> I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=987.934s">If</a> anyone has any comments, questions, thoughts, I'm happy to take them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=996.156s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1021.966s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1024.127s">Yeah,</a> they were invited at the same meeting we were.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1040.806s">Except</a> those bleachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1041.986s">But</a> yeah, if you all haven't seen the news articles, there's an issue in their gymnasium of the newly opened school where their bleachers are too big for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1055.7s">gym</a> itself and so they the bleachers come out onto the playing floor um so now that i've said that it'll be in your social media feed and you can take a look at the article but um yeah so we we are trying to um to get to to waltham um in particular i know that they just opened so they will it'll be a different aspect of like sort of their reactions to that building for sure
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1106.909s">So</a> part of the work of that committee is going to be to sort of follow the template set out by MSBA around the procurements and make sure that we're in good position to be in compliance with all of Medford's procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1123.044s">So</a> I think, you know... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1125.393s">if</a> you have procurement experience, that's a plus, because that is fundamentally what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1131.335s">If</a> you have experience working with OPMs, I think that is also a plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1139.279s">And,</a> you know, bringing that group together, the other thing that group will do is figure out, like, what is the process that we're going to go through to actually select the OPM? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1151.604s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1153.354s">I</a> would imagine that this larger group will certainly be invited to the table to listen to presentations and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1162.301s">But</a> ultimately, the recommendation and the selection of the OPM is going to have to sort of go through the selection committee and then to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1171.767s">So</a> I think time-wise, it's going to happen in like... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1176.218s">sort</a> of bursts, and I can't really even tell you when the bursts will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1181.686s">Certainly,</a> there's some upfront work to get those ARFPs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1184.99s">Once</a> they're out, there's sort of a quiet period, right, where we have to answer some questions, and then we really can't talk about the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1194.024s">And</a> then once everything comes in, we'll have to have an established timeline to work through all of those submissions, do interviews, and ultimately make a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1202.95s">So</a> whenever that happens, it's going to be the most time intensive space. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1208.313s">Some</a> of that will be a function of how many OPMs bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1213.997s">So</a> it's really hard to know, but doing bid reviews can be really, really time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1222.928s">I</a> do think there's a decent amount of work there for the team.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1281.189s">So</a> there's a couple questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1283.11s">One</a> is not all people play all roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1286.071s">Not</a> all organizations do all the roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1288.011s">Some</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1289.232s">So</a> some are architects and OPMs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1292.132s">Some</a> are just architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1293.373s">Some</a> are just OPMs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1294.633s">And</a> any version of that could... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1298.606s">be</a> what we see in terms of our bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1300.787s">The</a> OPM is going to help us do the heavy lifting to get the designer and the construction manager on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1307.068s">So</a> this work of getting the OPM on board is our work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1312.329s">Once</a> we do that, we now have somebody like paid staff that's going to help shepherd the rest of that along. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1318.45s">They</a> certainly are going to have a wealth of information about who does this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1324.144s">who</a> they've worked with before. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1326.506s">But</a> ultimately, this committee is going to make those selections. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1329.208s">So</a> no, there is no such thing as a forced marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1333.352s">Who</a> we hire to be the architect, who we hire to be the construction manager is up to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1339.437s">But</a> the OPM, you know, ideally is the person who can help guide this committee and do the heavy lifting for us once we have them on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1348.604s">But</a> it is really important to pick an OPM that sort of reflects <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1354.264s">what</a> we want to see as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1356.506s">So,</a> you know, finding the OPM that's a good fit for us is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1369.636s">Any</a> other questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1384.562s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1385.382s">I</a> mean, I think as soon as we are invited to the next phase, I would like our RFP to be out the door within 30 days max, because the sooner we do that, the sooner we have somebody on board and the sooner those next phases can happen, which is why I would like to get the procurement documents created in advance of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1407.813s">But</a> it's really hard to say because it will be driven by when MSBA invites us to <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1414.136s">the</a> board meeting to advance us to the next round. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1417.119s">So</a> those options, they meet every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1421.562s">They</a> do not meet in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1422.923s">So</a> they meet in October, they meet in December and they meet in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1427.027s">If</a> I had to guess, like where I think we're likely to be at the December board meeting, there's maybe an outside chance we'll make it to October, but we're not slated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1439.297s">We</a> were not originally slated to go to a board meeting until I think February.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1460.342s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think we can have that conversation and decide who those folks are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1465.785s">It</a> has to go to the school committee for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1469.747s">And</a> I don't believe there's any reason why we can't begin work, but I will confirm that with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1475.291s">So</a> I think if there are people who want to be part of this process, those nominations tonight would be helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1518.0s">The</a> next phase is forming the team, which includes the OPM and the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1523.703s">Then</a> the feasibility study happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1525.464s">So</a> the two things that must happen are we must have an OPM and we must have an architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1531.926s">And</a> then we get invited to feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1534.187s">The</a> construction manager comes later. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1537.937s">But</a> we so we have to get the OPM on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1541.518s">They</a> will help us get the designer on board and then we will be ready for feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1546.459s">So</a> there's actually several there's a couple of MSBA gates there in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1553.201s">Because</a> they they do have to approve our OPM, they have to approve our designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1557.242s">There's</a> a lot of approvals that they have to do along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1566.9s">I</a> do believe that Fiona has to be on the team and I believe Bob does, but they are both non-voting members of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1577.044s">So</a> there need to be at least three voting members of the committee on this subcommittee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1585.348s">So</a> I certainly will be on the committee, but I would love other folks to join us as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.249s">Thanks,</a> Libby. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.809s">Is</a> there anybody else that's dying to be on the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1615.556s">And</a> that goes for non-voting members as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1620.859s">You're</a> very welcome to be on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1625.578s">We</a> just need to make sure we have enough voting members that it can be a legitimate committee to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1656.178s">Yeah,</a> there's definitely a circuit of folks that play in this space. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1660.0s">So</a> we will proactively reach out to all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1664.783s">And</a> they're at conferences, they're at school committee conferences and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1668.404s">So</a> we have plenty of opportunities to meet folks.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1751.268s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1752.369s">So</a> Aaron, maybe you can be our fourth member so that we have some flexibility in terms of having a forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1762.613s">And</a> sometimes you just need arms and legs, people to review, make sure things make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1769.849s">So</a> I think that would be a great role for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1773.751s">And</a> you can learn all about the city's procurement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1777.412s">And</a> then I'm sure that can be useful somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1781.774s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1782.554s">So</a> what I have is Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, Fiona, and Bob, if Bob is required and or wants to be on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1793.278s">Is</a> there anybody else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1807.269s">Okay,</a> I'm going to put your name down. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1810.15s">So</a> is there a motion to approve this group? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1813.632s">Fiona,</a> Bob, if required, Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, and John. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1818.575s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1820.716s">Motion</a> by Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1824.349s">Seconded</a> by?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2140.187s">Maria</a> Dorsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2141.368s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2142.269s">Marissa</a> Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2144.871s">Absent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2145.912s">Luke</a> Preissner. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2149.034s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2149.334s">So</a> we have one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2151.676s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2153.557s">One.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2155.598s">Absent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2156.419s">We</a> have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2157.96s">Hello,</a> Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2160.66s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2161.181s">I</a> thought it was a separate link. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2163.203s">I</a> did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2164.924s">I</a> signed off and back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2166.065s">So</a> I did the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2169.709s">So</a> for this group, I did want to introduce Will formally and give him a minute to introduce himself because we will be working really closely with Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2179.639s">So</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2180.88s">Will,</a> did you want to introduce yourself?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2227.196s">Thanks,</a> Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2229.489s">So,</a> Will and I have, as I mentioned in the last meeting, been working behind the scenes to sort of make some of those submissions a little bit more digestible. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2238.532s">All</a> the credit to Will for doing a really fabulous job and doing it in a really quick turnaround kind of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2244.594s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2246.694s">And</a> we will post those out on the website and make them available for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2253.917s">I</a> think... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2255.563s">you</a> know, the maintenance and capital planning document is, is like dry reading, because it's about maintenance and capital planning, which is inherently not that exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2266.792s">But</a> there's actually like a lot of really great information in there about how the district is moving forward around maintenance, our custodial services, we have a green cleaning plan, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2286.751s">an</a> ongoing preventive maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2290.713s">We</a> have a lot of things now that are documented that was not always the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2297.576s">So</a> it's nice to be able to sort of showcase all of those things in one cohesive package. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2304.938s">The</a> other thing that's really enlightening about that document, I think, is when you look at some of the capital planning questions that the MSBA posed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2315.005s">They</a> asked questions like, how big is your maintenance budget and how big should it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2325.515s">if</a> there's a gap, why is there a gap? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2328.438s">So</a> they really are looking for people to be good stewards of their funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2333.583s">And</a> they asked really good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2336.586s">They</a> asked us to break things down sometimes in ways that we don't break things down in our sort of universe here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2343.672s">So</a> that has led to some conversations about breaking things down differently in the future, which I think is all good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2350.578s">And</a> then the other document about the enrollment projection I thought was very enlightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2357.281s">That</a> one took a lot of work to come together cohesively because they were seemingly very desperate things that had to be covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2367.326s">And</a> we were able to, I think, do a good job of sharing in that document everything that we've provided to MSBA about our plans and some of the things that we see coming down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2378.977s">Um,</a> and ultimately a justification for a building size for 1500 students plus, um, 200, um, 200 pre-K students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2391.159s">Um,</a> and I think, uh, another 100 kids corner, um, early childhood folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2400.681s">So,</a> uh, children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2402.142s">So</a> the total enrollment we put forward was 1800, which includes 1500 high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2409.689s">200</a> pre-K programming, and then 100 for kids scoring to sort of comprise everything that is in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2419.856s">So</a> it's sort of interesting to dig in there and see some of the information that we provided them, particularly if you've ever wondered like, what are we doing in housing in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2429.103s">It's</a> like a nice handy summary of those things because we really had to boil it up to provide it to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2435.527s">So</a> we'll get those out on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2438.73s">But</a> I did want to have some space on the agenda in case there was anything else that you all were thinking about for the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2445.495s">Now</a> that we have Will on board, he'll be taking the reins on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2449.559s">So</a> I just wanted to open it up to the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2451.661s">I</a> know there's not been tons of conversation of late in the community about this project because we've got other big things to talk about as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2461.649s">And</a> I think that that will continue through November. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2464.811s">But</a> I think just as soon as that's done and we're sort of moving on to those next gates, this will become all the conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2471.977s">So</a> I did want to like set aside just a little bit of time for us to think about like some of the planning exercises to be ready for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2479.544s">So</a> is there any, does anybody have any questions, comments about the website, Luke?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2539.197s">Yeah,</a> I do believe that they play heavily in that space, as well as in general in this community engagement space. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2548.543s">So</a> they will help drive some of the community engagement events that happen as we get into the design phase and that kind of thing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2612.327s">Yeah,</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2614.578s">Any</a> other questions, comments, thoughts about the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2617.9s">I</a> know it's just been, you know, quiet at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2621.442s">Maria?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2693.55s">take</a> a look through some of the model OPM procurement documents to figure out where do they fit, I guess I'll say, in the process of doing some of this work around PR, just to make sure that we have sort of an understanding of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2712.882s">But</a> I don't think there's really any reason why they couldn't get started in advance of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2717.125s">I</a> just want to double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2718.225s">And</a> Maria, I will follow up with you and let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2725.182s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2726.162s">So</a> the other thing I wanted to sort of circle back to that we talked about back in June was two updates, two surveys that we were going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2736.77s">And</a> I wanted to sort of bring Will into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2739.953s">We</a> had some conversation about doing a survey to all of our boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2745.157s">So</a> Medford has like, I don't know, 20 or 30 boards and commissions, Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2750.721s">And</a> they all have different, probably different <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2754.255s">sort</a> of attachments and levels of interest in the high school project. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2760.602s">Some</a> probably have a very high interest in a lot of things about the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2764.623s">Others</a> may have, you know, just sort of fleeting interest or want to know different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2769.445s">So</a> we did talk about creating a survey for the boards and commissions to try to get a feel for and an understanding of like where best to plug them all into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2783.85s">And</a> I wanted to check in with this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2786.151s">I</a> actually think. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2787.731s">now</a> is good timing to put that survey together. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2791.734s">And</a> we do have questions from our last meeting and give them some time in the next like six weeks or so to get back to us so that we can be prepared with that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2804.325s">On</a> the flip side, the FAQ survey, I have a little bit of a different opinion about, but I wanted to talk to this group about that timing and whether you think that's like the right timing for boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2814.98s">and</a> whether there's like any reason for us not to pursue that sort of in the next like two months or so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2853.75s">No,</a> we actually had established some questions in one of our last meetings to actually push out a formal survey so that we can get some standard responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2863.478s">And</a> I think if I'm remembering correctly, one of the questions is, <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2867.236s">do</a> you want somebody from the building committee to come present to you about the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2872.718s">Would</a> that be helpful for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2874.119s">And</a> if so, what is your meeting schedule and that kind of thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2877.28s">And</a> then we'll have to do some descriptor of what we see the process as so that they can say, this is how I think I can be helpful to this project or this is the kind of... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2890.405s">input</a> or place in the process that I would like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2893.426s">So</a> it's questions like that to help us frame when we should be reaching out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2898.407s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2899.968s">And</a> of course, we'll welcome their other questions, but it is like a defined survey set of four or five questions so that we can get a consistent response from them and then figure out how we proceed once we have it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2923.003s">Well,</a> I think we talked about them in our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2925.264s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2927.725s">And</a> so we can certainly pull those back up and Will and I will work on that and put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2933.988s">And</a> Will, we will send a copy to this group so that you know what those questions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2941.852s">And</a> if there's any comments, you can let us know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3010.186s">The</a> other survey that we talked about was a survey around the FAQs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3016.814s">So</a> really to start to ask the community, what are the kinds of questions you have about this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3027.245s">given</a> that we have a lot of other like hot topics related to schools going on in the community right now, I'm of the mind that we should defer pushing that survey out until like mid to late November. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3041.688s">And</a> that with a goal of, you know, being able to put some of those FAQs up by the end of the year, I think it will get lost in the noise if we try to do anything sooner than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3054.451s">Does</a> everyone agree with that approach?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3109.858s">Cool,</a> so we'll... <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3114.758s">I</a> think, roughly speaking, we'll plan to meet at some point after, like, in the mid-November timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3121.683s">Maybe</a> we can, like, Will and I, Will can draft up the survey to be able to push out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3128.648s">We</a> can review it together and then make a plan to push it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3131.87s">So</a> I think for this group, maybe the next time we meet can be, you know, mid to late November, like mid-November-ish, post-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3140.396s">Does</a> that work for everybody?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3151.403s">And</a> then the other thing that I do think. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3156.212s">I</a> would like for us to work on, and it can, it can come from the, I think from the district, maybe as an attachment, Dr. Edouard-Vincent to your weekly email is just an update on where we are, something sort of brief that says we're done with our deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3171.861s">You</a> can find them all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3174.883s">And,</a> you know, the next step is this, and we await that, you know, we await information from MSPA on taking that next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3181.266s">And</a> in the meantime, <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3182.625s">we'll</a> be coming to you to solicit questions and stay tuned for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3186.768s">So</a> something along that line so that people have an understanding of what's going on.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1474.121s">I</a> just have a quick question or a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1477.383s">If</a> possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything... <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1482.964s">sort</a> of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1488.847s">And</a> the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1500.813s">So</a> I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1510.987s">like</a> the letter that is attached talks about an impact report. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1514.851s">That's</a> important because we want to make sure we're doing those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1517.353s">But</a> if there are other things that sort of... <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1520.74s">outlying</a> or restrict or govern in some way or operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1530.904s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4288.221s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4289.522s">How</a> much was the grant from DESE?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4320.197s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4321.358s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4322.659s">And</a> we've done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4325.74s">And</a> how did we pay for it in the past?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4337.263s">And</a> is it a grant that comes around every year or not necessarily? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4342.304s">We</a> have our fingers crossed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.053s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.653s">It's</a> just helpful to know as we ultimately think about the budget and what needs to go in the budget, particularly because <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4384.522s">planning</a> for this, if we're doing it in advance, is going to pre-date, you know, precede any sort of budget hearings and approvals and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4391.744s">So</a> when you're ready to present a proposal, please do so that we can figure out how to handle that proactively.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4402.066s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4996.761s">I</a> think the other thing that's important to call out here is the huge disparity in enrollment at our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5006.685s">In</a> my mind, it was always like about 100 kids different. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5010.146s">And</a> now it's like pushing 200 students different between the Roberts and the Missatuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5017.288s">Almost</a> 150 between Brooks and Missatuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5021.03s">And</a> I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5026.833s">to</a> do a couple of things, but one is to put on our radar collectively that like we can't, the gap can't keep widening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5033.958s">Like</a> we have to do something different than we're doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5039.122s">And</a> I've talked to people about this a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5042.225s">There's</a> not an easy, obvious answer short of like picking a bunch of kids up who live at the McGlynn basically and sending them to the Missatuck or picking a bunch of kids up that live next door to the Brooks and sending them to Missatuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5056.041s">because</a> of the sort of placement of the Missatuck building in the city, there's sort of less that you can draw from to add to those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5065.33s">And</a> I know it's a huge challenge, but I don't think we can continue to like operate in this fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5071.976s">So</a> we have to do something.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5759.446s">One</a> of the things that we've been working on through the MSBA process is working with MSBA to certify our enrollment projection for Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5768.771s">That</a> enrollment projection when we sort of get to agreement is how we will decide how big the school becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5776.935s">So</a> we've had to actually do a lot of really like interesting and fascinating work around like future projected enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5784.219s">And</a> so we have to give them information about like <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5787.975s">our</a> live births and we have to give them information about projected housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5793.399s">And</a> there's been a whole slew of information we've had to provide to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5797.683s">I</a> am working to make it a little bit more digestible because you have to submit everything into this system and it makes it really hard to extract it in a way that it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5809.512s">So</a> I am working on something to be able to put on the website so people can see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5813.636s">But</a> it's been sort of an interesting conversation with <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5817.604s">folks</a> at city hall about like what is actually coming down the pike from a housing perspective and housing production goals and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5827.572s">But</a> I think the other thing that I would say is I would love for the city staff to be watching carefully when real estate in the Roberts neighborhood, like directly adjacent becomes available because there is no way out of the parking situation over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5842.664s">And</a> there's no way out of the playground situation without more space. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5847.122s">so</a> i do think the city needs to do something seriously to address that because you can't there are 200 more kids trying to use that playground than trying to use the two playgrounds at missituck and a giant field so there's and there's just literally not time to walk to hickey park for recess every single day so <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5869.111s">something</a> has to give there, whether that building becomes drastically smaller in enrollment because of the space constraints, or we try to address the space constraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5879.398s">There's</a> probably a bunch of facets there, some of which are in our control and some of which are probably more city controlled sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5888.491s">endeavors</a> and decisions so i think we need to look at all of that when we think about distributing what's a reasonable time frame to get that kind of report of what that looks like or what models are being considered the enrollment projection report probably within a month or so i will have that up online for everybody because it is a document that we can share um <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5912.921s">So</a> that piece is easy enough to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5916.143s">It's</a> just sort of, it's a formatting mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5918.725s">And</a> I think it's going to be really hard for people to digest the way that it sort of gets extracted from the system right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5924.589s">In</a> terms of like that bigger conversation about what happens next, I'll defer to the superintendent, but I would imagine we have to have some meetings where we talk about like what even our goals would be for that kind of conversation, because something like that could start like this big and it could end up this big. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5941.343s">and</a> it could go in any sort of direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5943.164s">So</a> we might want to think about sort of putting some parameters around what we're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5948.267s">Is</a> that a special meeting of this body? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5951.489s">Is</a> it a strategic planning group? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5954.031s">I</a> think we could maybe do it either way, but I would think it's maybe a committee of the whole because it's such a big project.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6965.589s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6966.95s">I</a> would agree with you that this should go on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6969.791s">I'm</a> generally not in favor of charging kids to get to school, like no matter how they have to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6978.636s">I</a> don't think we should charge for buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6980.277s">I</a> think we should provide more buses than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6982.978s">If</a> you've been paying attention on social media, there's a lot of conversation about buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6988.922s">The</a> program around free MBTA transportation was stopped without this <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6993.854s">committee's</a> authorization to do so, we have to stop charging kids to get them to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6999.358s">Like</a> it's our job to educate them and we can't do that if they're not in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7002.44s">And</a> so like for me, for any which way that we're gonna charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7008.032s">families</a> to get them to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7010.094s">It</a> just feels like we're heading in the wrong direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7013.516s">I</a> understand that we are charging some kids and not others. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7016.699s">And</a> I think that is also a problem, but charging more kids for me doesn't get us closer to the goal of not charging kids to have to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7024.244s">So</a> I'm not super in favor of this, but I do think it should go on the agenda separately noticed so that parents can understand that that's what we are talking about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8155.634s">I</a> have huge reservations about any idea that we would have to bring buses in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8161.829s">I</a> would need to see a bullet proof plan that we're going to do it well, because I think we try to do a lot of things here on the cheap and it never works out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8172.692s">So</a> it would take a lot of convincing for me to agree that we have the organizational capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8180.974s">We</a> lack basic systems and structures every single place that you look. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8186.192s">to</a> think about bringing on something that we know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8189.273s">I</a> have huge reservations about, I think we could maybe get there at some point, but what I would like to see is for us to own the pieces of this process that we already own and don't do well every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8202.119s">So</a> we need to completely re-envision how we think about bus service. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8207.061s">We</a> should not be asking families if they are gonna ride the bus, unless we know that they're eligible to ride the bus and that we have space for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8214.984s">We</a> know where every kid lives and we should be using that information proactively before two weeks before the start of school to be mapping routes and doing all the things that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8226.33s">So</a> I think there's a huge amount of improvement to make all around, including with our vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8233.414s">And</a> if we need to have them come to a future meeting, I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8237.455s">It's</a> a very complicated problem, but we have to own the pieces of this problem that we have failed at as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8243.097s">And</a> I think the communication piece of this and the planning and really just sitting back and saying, what should this process look like and when would these steps happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8252.92s">would</a> probably result in a completely different process than we do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8258.164s">So</a> I think that is something we can actionably do, whether we have two more buses or three more buses or zero more buses, like we can get the registration process right and we're not even there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8269.492s">So</a> I do think that needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8272.454s">We</a> need to not be in situations where we're sending <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8276.286s">emails</a> to families after the start of school, telling them, hey, change your plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8281.827s">Sorry,</a> we don't actually have a bus for your kids after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8285.188s">We</a> need to do better by this process for the things that we can control. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8289.489s">And</a> it's not everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8290.509s">We</a> can't control how many bus drivers quit training in the week before school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8296.53s">We</a> can't control that, but we can control a whole lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8300.732s">I</a> do think I would like to see some sort of analysis of like how this process should go in the future because I don't think we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8309.46s">And</a> this is extraordinarily complicated issue I get that and I appreciate that and I just want to say I know how hard people are working to try to fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8319.827s">the</a> like unexpected string of problems that are sort of unfolding as the school year unfolds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8325.673s">And</a> I do really, really appreciate their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8328.195s">We</a> have a new coordinator of transportation in our administrative assistance unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8333.2s">She's</a> learning a brand new job that never existed before. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8336.838s">and</a> having to do this all at prime time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8339.279s">The</a> office is frankly probably too small to have a director that shares responsibilities with all kinds of things and this, and just one administrative assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8348.742s">Like</a> there's a lot of problems here that we need to own ourselves and try to fix and do better by. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8353.623s">Because</a> if we could tighten all of that up, would this problem have been better? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8359.024s">Probably.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8360.885s">Maybe</a> not entirely, but probably at least somewhat better. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8364.486s">And</a> we need to do that next year because we just can't, we just, we do this every year, every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8369.49s">It's</a> chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8370.772s">And</a> it seems like the chaos shifts every year, but it's still chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8375.135s">So</a> we need to maybe try not to do chaos next year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9284.521s">Dr.</a> Cushing, before you continue, are there any questions about what Dr. Cushing has gone through? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9288.984s">He</a> just did like three updates real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.045s">Yeah,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.866s">That's</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9850.756s">We</a> don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have one item of new business. <a

thank you for hopping on and making sure that we have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=274.22s">But</a> I am really delighted to report that all of our feasibility, all of our eligibility phase deliverables and getting ahead of myself are complete and submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=288.043s">So</a> that's like a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=290.263s">So</a> just a quick rundown for all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=293.244s">The</a> feasibility study, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=296.328s">funding</a> earmark is something that the council had to take up and vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=301.949s">They</a> did that at the 625 meeting, and they voted to earmark or allocate $3 million for our feasibility study that has been moved into a special account that will sort of sit and wait for us to be ready to <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=318.633s">spend</a> that money by a vote of six affirmative, zero negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=325.857s">And</a> that information has been transmitted over to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=328.638s">We</a> did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=329.739s">They</a> actually had to approve the language up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=334.641s">They</a> were watching closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=336.002s">They</a> watched the meetings get posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=339.504s">And</a> they were very eager to hear our results. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=342.665s">And</a> so they know that that has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=345.467s">So</a> that's a really big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=348.288s">and</a> very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=351.269s">The</a> very next day, I finally hit submit on our chapter 74 form, which includes the expanded programs that we're looking to study in our feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=362.231s">So</a> thanks to Dr. Cushing and Chad Fallon in particular, who helped flesh out that document, both from a like current capacity of programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=374.694s">future</a> capacity to demonstrate sort of where the wait list was at, to demonstrate that expansion was viable, as well as the work that they did in the lead up to all of that to bring forward to the school committee a proposal that would have us study five new programs as part of this feasibility study from a space perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=396.779s">So</a> all of that, and you all approved the submission of that form a couple of meetings ago, but all of that went in on the 26th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=406.505s">The</a> educational profile went in on 7-1 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=411.607s">because</a> I wanted to read it again with fresh eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=414.488s">It</a> is a 20-something page document that includes a lot of hard work from all of you and the administration in particular who worked hard to answer a lot of questions about teaching methodology and in particular some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=432.877s">questions</a> about early education and child care where we have an opportunity to be thinking about studying those things in our educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=442.504s">So</a> that went in on 7-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=446.127s">You</a> all have copies that Lisa Malone shared with you with this meeting agenda of those two deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=454.774s">We</a> are also working to update the website so that all of those deliverables are available to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=461.202s">So</a> you can look out for that on the public site coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=465.887s">But</a> those deliverables have gone over to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=469.551s">The</a> next thing that we submitted on the 11th, which was last week, was our enrollment projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=473.852s">And</a> that goes through a series of questions around not just school enrollment, but verifying that their numbers that they get from DESE are correct, as well as asking a lot of questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=488.664s">um,</a> the development plans of the city in terms of housing, um, housing capacity, housing expansion, um, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=497.286s">So,</a> um, the mayor's office was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=499.687s">Alicia</a> Hunt in particular, uh, was critical to collecting all of the information from a whole bunch of, um, different folks, um, across the administration, including like the number of building permits and the housing projects that are, that are sort of in permitting phase and how many units they're supposed to be, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=517.271s">And</a> the other thing we had to submit with our enrollment projection was a lot of information about our special education programs that Joan Bowen helped with. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=528.355s">And</a> then a big discussion around our early education and childcare programming that Dr. Pelosi was very integral. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=537.799s">So</a> all of that went in on the 7th, sorry, on the 11th, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=543.161s">On</a> Friday evening, thanks to the help of john McLaughlin and in particular, Paul Rousseau and Dr. Cushing, we submitted our maintenance and capital planning documentation, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=558.158s">sort</a> of a beast to submit because it covered everything from what are the job descriptions of your maintenance staff to what should your maintenance budget be and if there is a variance between your actual budget and what you think it should be, why is there a variance, and essentially like asking us to respond to how will we ensure good solid maintenance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=579.783s">So</a> it required <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=580.983s">a</a> ton of exhibits and attachments and lots of work by the finance office under Gerry McCue and Noel. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=591.268s">So</a> all of that work, finally, finally, last finishing touches went in on the 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=600.087s">I</a> did talk with MSBA last week, and at the time, what they indicated to me was that the next step for us would be a meeting where we essentially agree on a certified number of students that we would be studying the size of the building for. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=620.915s">When</a> I asked last week what she thought the timeline of that would be, she indicated that we should expect <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=627.216s">to</a> set up that meeting either in late summer or early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=632.978s">And</a> yesterday I got an email saying that they're available to talk to us as soon as next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=637.18s">So</a> we will be having that meeting next week with MSBA and folks from the mayor's team and from the administration where they will go through sort of their deep dive into all of the information we submitted, the housing plans, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=652.785s">And</a> then we will talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=655.531s">what</a> that certified enrollment number should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=658.492s">So</a> that is the next piece in the puzzle and the next step for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=666.375s">Once</a> that is done, all of our information will have to go to the board for consideration and approval to move to what they call module two. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=674.498s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=679.241s">that</a> according to the 270-day timeline that would have had us at the February board meeting, I am hopeful that we will make an appearance at a sooner board meeting than February, given that we're sort of moving quickly through our deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=696.293s">So</a> I'm not sure exactly where that will land or what the lead time is between the time when we say we're sort of all in agreement about this enrollment study and when <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=708.522s">reasonably,</a> things can get to the board for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=711.186s">So</a> we'll sort of learn more about that in the coming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=716.212s">But</a> that is a wrap, as they say, for the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=722.501s">So</a> I'll stop and ask if anybody has any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=733.459s">You</a> know how frequently the board meets? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=734.9s">Is</a> it quarterly or? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=736.722s">They</a> meet every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=740.445s">So</a> they have a December meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=742.867s">They</a> have an October meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=745.129s">So</a> they must have an August meeting is my guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=750.433s">But</a> yeah, it's like an every other month schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=757.059s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=758.427s">Well,</a> seeing and hearing no other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=761.751s">The</a> other thing that I wanted to mention in terms of next steps is for this group to really start to think about immersing itself in what they call module two, which is officially called assembling the project team. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=778.251s">So</a> this is where we will put out a procurement to hire an owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=783.392s">And</a> we will bring that person on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=786.393s">And</a> then that OPM will help us craft our procurement to secure the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=793.934s">So</a> there is a process around the work that the OPM will do with us in order to inform that architect's bid or bid request. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=806.022s">As</a> I've started reading, there is a template that I believe MSBA requires us to use to secure the OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=813.991s">I</a> have been in touch with the procurement office to make sure like we have a good understanding of what all is needed from the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=822.22s">um</a> for compliance purposes but between now and the next meeting if you all can find 40 minutes or so to immerse yourself in sort of that next module process I think that would be informative and educational for everybody in terms of like what we need to do but but briefly we will have to form a selection committee who will um <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=844.535s">who</a> will pick the OPM essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=848.457s">So</a> there's gonna be some work for us to sort of get that procurement ready to go out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=853.198s">And</a> then once we receive those bids back, we among us will have to decide how the selection committee will be formed is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=864.763s">And</a> then there may be some meetings with MSBA or like round tables that happen that they may require us to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=874.195s">There</a> is a whole slew of other things that happen in module two because you move on to the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=878.258s">But</a> like in my mind, once we have the OPM on board, it will be somebody who does this for a living with MSBA and they will be able to sort of help educate us along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=889.825s">So</a> that's just a sort of to do for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=893.248s">And</a> I'm still like reading and diving through those documents myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=897.691s">So</a> that is something we'll talk about and take up in our next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=905.778s">Questions</a> about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=906.759s">Tracy?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=908.843s">Where</a> do we find modulo 2? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=911.491s">If</a> you go onto the MSBA website, there's a section called building with us and it specs it out module one, module two, module three. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=921.056s">So</a> if you go in there, you can like really dive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=924.717s">There's</a> lots of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=925.738s">There's</a> lots of information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=928.359s">All</a> the model documents are out there as well as, you know, there are documents around like really like what they see in terms of, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=939.404s">Costs</a> that other communities have incurred or over the course of this next phase, both for the OPM and the designer and then in construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=951.434s">And,</a> you know, it's hard to look at those and and really assess like how does that compare to what we will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=958.92s">I</a> will say that MSBA was comfortable with the allocation of $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=964.463s">And</a> they don't give communities numbers, but they are happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=971.386s">They</a> will tell a community if they have not allocated a sufficient amount of funds for the phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=976.408s">So</a> we're good there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=977.449s">And</a> obviously, the procurement will have to support whatever we do from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=983.952s">So</a> yeah, all of that is on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=989.333s">And</a> there's lots of templates and information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=994.054s">Their</a> board meetings are public. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=997.135s">Everyone</a> is welcome to join, as are all of their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1001.757s">So</a> if there are meetings that you see out there, you're all welcome to just join and listen and be a participant. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1008.839s">But</a> there will be some formal things that we have to attend over the course of the next phase as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1016.041s">So</a> we'll keep an eye on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1022.357s">Any</a> other questions about Module 2? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1034.804s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1036.085s">Um,</a> so the other thing that I wanted to make sure that I say out loud is that we originally had an August 14 meeting scheduled for the full committee via zoom, and we will not have that meeting as a full committee, because we are very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1054.98s">in</a> a mode of waiting to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1056.801s">So</a> I don't wanna take up your time in that next meeting if there is an action for this group to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1062.883s">Instead,</a> the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee will meet at that time on August 14th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1070.286s">And</a> that will help us fill the gap of the meeting that I needed to reschedule at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1077.811s">Um,</a> and they will be, uh, working on the communications and community agent subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1083.393s">We'll</a> be working on some of the surveys to collect FAQs from, um, from residents, um, as well as, um, a survey that gets out to all our boards and commissions to help understand sort of who needs to be plugged into the process and when. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1097.878s">And</a> then the other thing that we'll be working on is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1101.772s">you</a> know, the start of what will become a little bit of like a roadshow kind of document that we can use to talk about where we are with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1114.413s">And</a> I also am in touch with a couple of folks in a couple of districts about tours to be scheduled over the course of this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1122.181s">So</a> as soon as I have those dates, I will let you know so you can mark your calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1126.805s">My</a> contacts are just trying to like work with their contacts and navigate everybody's school vacation out of office time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1133.632s">So</a> more to come on that, but as those get scheduled, I will keep you posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1141.338s">Um,</a> are there any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1145.719s">Or</a> from the group about where we are and what we're doing anything.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1167.327s">Oh,</a> it was a true team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1172.89s">There</a> was a lot of documentation, particularly on the maintenance capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1177.592s">Oh,</a> thank you for that reminder, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1180.134s">The</a> enrollment projection and the maintenance and capital planning information gets submitted directly into a portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1187.878s">So</a> it's not quite as easy to just pop it out to the site and link it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1194.421s">So</a> I'm working through like how to make that information shareable. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1198.484s">Like</a> we have working documents that we use to like get those answers ready and they're a hot mess like working documents are. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1206.631s">So</a> I'm just gonna, I'm just working on like how to make sure like there can be a cohesive story there and then we will publish all of that stuff out to the website as well if people are interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1216.078s">And</a> we will share all of that with you all as soon as it's <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1220.196s">as</a> soon as it's cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1221.197s">So</a> that's on my to-do list over the coming days is just to figure out like, especially with the maintenance stuff, it's just, it's a lot and it's a hundred attachments and all kinds of things, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1238.431s">Any</a> other questions, comments, thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1251.47s">Okay,</a> is there a motion to adjourn?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1145.778s">Motion</a> to approve the Medford Educational Administrative Assistant's AFSCME 93 contract.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1206.173s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1208.416s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2256.018s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2258.701s">I</a> just wanted to talk about what we have done in the past from a process perspective, since we have so many new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2268.277s">just</a> to sort of get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2270.958s">So</a> this is the superintendent self-evaluation, and then we as a committee have to compile our evaluation and then present it back in an open session just like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2283.665s">But</a> what we did last year that seemed to work was that the evaluation subcommittee met, had a meeting, established a timeline, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2293.65s">of</a> all the steps that had to happen from our perspective, and then held a separate, a second meeting where they compiled the results from all the different pieces of evaluation from each of us individually, and then that came to the floor to be <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2312.674s">to</a> be reviewed here and presented and ultimately approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2318.477s">So</a> I think those are the next steps is for that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2322.039s">And</a> I think member Olapade chairs that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2324.92s">So</a> I think the next steps would be for you all to find a time to meet and establish the right timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2331.084s">And</a> we can dig up and obviously support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2335.646s">with</a> the process because I think everyone on the committee is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2338.908s">So</a> we can definitely give you some process like guidance along the way in terms of what needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2349.414s">But</a> I think the most important thing for all the members to know is that everything that we do here as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2358.069s">compiling</a> the superintendent's evaluation is a matter of public record and must be done on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2364.935s">This</a> is not stuff that happens in executive session, which. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2368.846s">is</a> the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2369.947s">It's</a> not, would not be my preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2371.929s">I'm</a> sure it would not be the superintendent's preference, but there are unfortunately like there, that is the process that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2379.455s">So</a> all of your subcommittee meetings will be held as hosted subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2385.12s">Members</a> of the public are free to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2388.243s">And</a> the sort of mechanics of how you compile all have to be done in <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2393.867s">in</a> open session, so I just wanted to put that out there because there are some next steps there, and I just wanted to make sure that if there are questions about that, we give folks an opportunity to ask some questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4286.442s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4287.283s">Um,</a> does I think this is a question for Miss Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4293.329s">What</a> kind of supports does city air provide to its staff, given that that stipend would not allow you to live in the area, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4302.898s">So</a> that is not enough money to <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4306.872s">pay</a> rent, eat, do all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4309.016s">Are</a> there other supports that you're providing to the team so that they can actually live in the area that they are working in?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4390.9s">And</a> then I think this question is maybe for the superintendent, in terms of like how you envision these teams being used, I guess like the things that I started thinking about immediately are some of our operational challenges around substitute coverage around after school, but it sounds like substitute coverage is not an option in terms of how they work with our, with our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4412.64s">So</a> would these students, like if they're in the classroom working with teachers, I think the question about union work is a good one to be asking to make sure that we're not tripping on our bargaining obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4430.665s">But</a> also if we were to try to think about like the afterschool challenge of capacity in, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4439.827s">some</a> of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4440.807s">I</a> know Brooks is sort of an anomaly because the program is too big for the building, but at Missittuck and McGlynn and Roberts for sure, there is some capacity, I think, to expand the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4453.592s">Would</a> these staff being infused into the afterschool program allow us to take more students into the program that Megan runs?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4563.703s">And</a> so tactically, do you have a number of people that we could take off the wait list and place into the program?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4640.967s">Yeah,</a> I think I would definitely be interested in knowing how do we quantify that because <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4647.327s">that's</a> an important and ongoing discussion that we're sort of always having. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4651.45s">And</a> we have wait lists in all the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4653.172s">So</a> if there is like a quantifiable way to say what we would be able to do, that would, I think, be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4661.118s">The</a> other question I have is about the work that they're doing in collaboration with a teacher in a classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4667.964s">How</a> are they trained on the curricula that our teachers are using? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4671.647s">So</a> I know we have been like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4674.409s">sort</a> of fighting the good fight around the science of reading and using evidence-based instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4680.914s">And</a> I am a little nervous about tutors in the mix who may not be apprised of all of those things that our teachers are sort of on the front lines of every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4696.307s">So</a> I was just curious, and maybe that's a question for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4699.149s">Roberts,</a> how that works.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5922.997s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5924.098s">Miss</a> Roberts, I respect the fact that there's a lot of questions that we've posed that are not for you to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5931.482s">And</a> that's sort of always the case with these kinds of sort of big strategic efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5939.567s">And</a> I wondered if <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5943.055s">we</a> could plan to have a follow-up meeting, perhaps the week of July 8th, to be able to provide you a final answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5950.459s">One</a> of the things that I am thinking about is that we also have, due at some point, a report back from Meghan Fidler-Carey about any ways in which the administration has come up with any expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5966.787s">And</a> we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5968.748s">We</a> talked about things like using the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5971.631s">We've</a> talked about a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5973.433s">So</a> I just wonder if given like if we could just get by ourselves a couple of weeks, could we put together like a cohesive plan about how this could work effectively here in our district that would be compelling? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5989.708s">And</a> with the framing of it all as sort of supplementing the afterschool staff as its primary mission, which I think is sort of the thing we're all coalescing around, the revolving fund account for the afterschool program could be relied on to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6007.899s">So</a> the budget concerns that my colleagues have, which are well-founded, are separate concerns when you're talking about a revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6017.665s">So</a> I just, I guess my roundabout ask is maybe twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6022.206s">One,</a> could we get back to you in a couple of weeks so that we can do a little bit of due diligence planning on our end? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6028.987s">And</a> two, superintendent, could we schedule a meeting for the week of the eighth where we circle back, close that open loop about afterschool programming with this in mind and say, this is sort of, what does this look like as part of that solution?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6185.854s">Yeah,</a> your point about these folks needing to find housing in our housing market is a really good one, actually, because it is really hard everywhere, and Medford is not an exception to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6201.112s">You</a> know, I, I don't know, you know where the rest of the committee is at. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6205.315s">I</a> think if we could, I don't know if maybe we try to approve this tonight with an expectation that some sort of report can be provided to us in the next couple of weeks that <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6219.206s">sort</a> of answers some of these questions that has been posed just so that we have sort of a closed loop process and then we can we can and still I think should have our meeting about broadly what happens with after school but it would sort of take that contingency out of the mix for Miss Roberts and and the staff that we would want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6240.556s">So</a> I don't know if maybe that's an option where <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6243.177s">We</a> approve this tonight, and we still schedule that after school meeting sometime in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6249.64s">That</a> sort of takes the timing pressure off, but allows us to sort of onboard this pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6257.244s">So</a> I'm open to feedback on that idea, and I'm happy to make a motion, but thoughts?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6407.356s">So</a> then I will make a motion to approve <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6410.867s">the</a> two teams as discussed for Magdalene and Missituk, and that we'll have a summer meeting about resuming our conversation around afterschool programming.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6636.15s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6783.171s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to say thank you to Dr Cushing because we have been having this conversation in negotiations about exactly how this will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6792.999s">And</a> just last week, one of our bargaining partners was describing that <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6798.263s">this</a> exact system is what they wanted to see us implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6801.804s">So</a> thank you for not being in the room, but knowing what that was and making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6806.766s">So</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6809.427s">And</a> I think, you know, the direct connection to frontline is critically important to streamlining <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6817.169s">how</a> we pay our staff, how we ensure that we're paying people for overtime in accordance with the contract and the law and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6826.991s">So</a> thank you for all of that, motion to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6837.393s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6861.809s">Motion</a> to take 2024-30 out of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7313.936s">Thank</a> you, and I sort of am feeling like, so two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7321.819s">One</a> is I'm in favor of having these discussions because I think to your point about the opportunities that having some additional support might provide is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7331.962s">So</a> I'm sort of inclined to say what I'd like to see us do is adopt the statute, which we have to do in order for any of this to be legally possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7343.185s">but</a> also adopt the statute with an amendment that states that before any sort of change happens, that that plan will be presented to us for review and approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7358.812s">And</a> the reason I say that is because there's any number of ways where this, like, I think we've just talked about like five of them literally in a minute, that this could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7367.374s">It</a> could just simply be support and then everybody still reports to the superintendent and the school committee still holds the contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7374.856s">It</a> could be that the contracts go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7377.437s">It</a> could, you know, any number of things could happen in any of these departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7380.678s">So</a> what I would like to see is that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7385.484s">we</a> agree that we should investigate what these options are and bring those proposals back to this group before those actions are taken.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7407.401s">So</a> we don't usually do B papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7410.603s">So</a> do I make a motion to like approve the paper and then somebody else adds a B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7416.785s">Is</a> that how it happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7418.646s">You</a> could do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7419.227s">You</a> could do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7419.867s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7427.45s">What</a> I'm saying is we would be accepting the statute <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7432.681s">So</a> we would make a motion to accept the statute, which has to happen in order for the statute to be accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7438.285s">And</a> then there would be a B paper added that is a motion that requires school committee approval before any plan is implemented for shared resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7449.293s">So</a> what we would be doing tonight would simply be opening the door to have that discussion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7470.788s">Member</a> Ruseau, do you need me to repeat that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7485.247s">motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7485.407s">Two</a> motions of main paper and then the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7490.709s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7591.341s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7627.553s">Hold</a> on one second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7629.377s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7632.258s">There's</a> a recommendation to approve the FY 25 Medford Public Schools operating budget by Mr. Gerry McCue, Director of Finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7639.041s">So</a> the mayor is abstaining from this vote entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7641.922s">Member</a> Branley, did you have a conflict you want to cite so that we know what we need to do?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7662.877s">When</a> the time comes, we will, um, take that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7666.2s">Okay,</a> thank you, Mr. McHugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7669.002s">The</a> floor is yours.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7891.394s">Thank</a> you, Mr. McHugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7893.358s">For</a> the committee, are there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7898.427s">Member</a> Lapate and then member Intoppa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8103.294s">Sorry,</a> number and tapa you're good.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8253.82s">And</a> thank you, Member Intoppa, and I think that's an important clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8258.944s">My</a> understanding, though, is that for the administrators unit, one of the positions that was cut, that individual actually has accepted another position in the district, so she is remaining with the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8273.455s">And</a> then my understanding of the performing arts position is that the individual in that role has resigned, so the position is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8284.081s">And</a> so I would like somebody, maybe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8286.302s">Glucy,</a> Dr. Glucy, to describe the vision for supporting performing arts under this new structure if this budget passes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8403.274s">I</a> hope that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8404.835s">That</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8405.855s">Will</a> this be a promotion for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8410.157s">Fee</a> with taking on the extra department or does this all fall under her current director one job description?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8426.803s">Okay,</a> thank you for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8430.484s">Okay,</a> member Reinfeld.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8541.79s">So</a> a motion to receive a report by December 7th that specifically accounts for what has transpired, where any position reductions are maintained in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8557.187s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8582.916s">You</a> could send it to Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8584.296s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8585.356s">Member</a> Reinfeld, is there a second?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8589.082s">second</a> by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8592.804s">Let's</a> sort of pause game and take this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8597.586s">I</a> tell that to my kids when I want them to do the laundry or really anything else in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8601.628s">So</a> on the motion by Member Reinfeld, which was seconded by Member Ruseau to receive a report by December 7th about these position reductions and the implementation, Member Ruseau, can you please call the roll?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8617.817s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8619.864s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8632.835s">Yes,</a> I believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8636.858s">I'm</a> just looking, yes, you can mark her absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8639.68s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8644.178s">Five</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8647.02s">No,</a> six in the affirmative, one absent, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8650.482s">The</a> motion is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8652.984s">Member</a> Ruseau, you had your hand in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8655.045s">Actually,</a> Member Reinfeld, are you done with your questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8660.229s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8661.37s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8927.141s">members.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8927.441s">So</a> if I can, um, offer a point of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8931.222s">Clarification</a> real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8933.183s">Um,</a> the does this have to do, uh. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8937.925s">Mr.</a> McHugh with the kindergarten teachers because there were four kindergarten teachers added to the budget after it was approved last year, so it doesn't look like a budget cut because they never were in the
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9498.467s">Member</a> Reinfeld?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9650.085s">Other</a> questions from the committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9712.904s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9713.464s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9824.783s">I'll</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9828.667s">Member</a> Ruseau, can you repeat it again?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9868.245s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9868.645s">Member</a> Intoppa, did you have a question about the motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9902.787s">But</a> to your, I think to the spirit of what you were trying to do, Member Intoppa, one of the things like on my personal list, if we are to see a successful override in November is to get back to addressing those stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9921.281s">I</a> know there have been some joint labor discussions with the teachers union about those stipends, which obviously has stalled because there has been no money in the budget to really think through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9933.911s">But</a> in terms of like sort of how like how did we create the the number is <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9940.476s">a</a> complex question in terms of where those override numbers came from, but very much on my mind were a number of things, including the stipend district-wide, not just for the band, but for all of our athletic coaches, for all of our after-school, all of our advisors, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9960.448s">So</a> it's sort of a packaged <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9962.529s">deal</a> that when you think about all of those stipends together, it is not a few thousand dollars that needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9969.053s">It's</a> quite significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9970.254s">So,</a> I am hopeful that with a successful two override votes in November that we will have some breathing room to be able to get back to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9979.739s">So,</a> I'll see you at the doors convincing people of that with me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10010.28s">Okay,</a> Member Ruseau, can you read the amended motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10048.24s">Okay,</a> on the motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10051.943s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10072.953s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10076.697s">So</a> six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10082.243s">Thank</a> you all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10083.444s">And</a> I have taken notes on my <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10087.202s">tasks</a> going forward, and we will hopefully report back with something successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10092.405s">Before,</a> I do want to ask if there are members on Zoom who would like to provide comment, but before we do that, I just had a couple of things I wanted to say and clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10107.154s">That</a> I think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10108.896s">So</a> this budget does tell a really nice story about how we got here over the course of many meetings through open and transparent process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10119.927s">So</a> thank you for that, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10123.191s">This</a> also does reflect <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10126.534s">a</a> lot of what I call budget cleanups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10129.037s">So</a> one of the things that does get complicated in future years when you come back and look at this budget, you're like, why did that change so substantially? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10140.489s">And</a> so maybe there is a need to put an asterisk in the budget that says like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10145.154s">There</a> was sort of cleanup of accounts and movement and reclassifications that happen, which mean which the consequences like some of these accounts look like they either artificially inflated or deflated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10158.486s">When</a> in fact, that's really was just a reflection of reclassifying positions into the right places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10166.849s">I</a> also thought the format was very digestible, and I appreciated completely that we didn't kill nearly as many trees in the printing of this budget as we do on the regular when we print budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10180.878s">The</a> other thing that I thought was really compelling, and I just wanted to say thank you for it, was the charts at the front that really clearly describe, like, what are our enrollments in each school and in each grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10193.766s">how</a> does the staff that supports the building lay out in the in the various buildings and so if you look at you know what happens on page four and what happens on page five you have a really clear picture of how many students are in this building and you have a really clear picture of like and what staff is there to support them so I think that's something that's been very missing from our budgets for a really long time so <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10218.109s">I</a> am really happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10219.771s">I</a> love the new format. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10222.114s">It</a> didn't take me like 17 years to read the budget and get ready for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10226.579s">And</a> because it sort of provided that narrative that you just have to sort of sleuth together yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10232.626s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10233.927s">Thank</a> you for all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10235.889s">And</a> I will say, just to sort of quickly recap for people who are on the call and listening, under the citywide budget ordinance, the process kicked off for us in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10253.998s">And</a> in March, the mayor is required under the ordinance to provide an initial allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10259.94s">And</a> when she did at that time, it was 73.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10264.102s">We</a> then, Jerry and team and the superintendent then got to work to sort of try to sort of land somewhere in hybrid territory of like not just what do we need, but like how can we put how could we possibly get to that number because this ramp off of Essar is significant and important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10285.658s">In</a> the end, the work of the mayor with the approval of the city council brought our budget to $77.75 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10293.784s">So</a> that's like a multi-million dollar increase over the initial allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10297.847s">So</a> I think that's a really important point that we have avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10304.051s">cuts</a> that we hadn't even yet brought ourselves to discuss because we were able to the city was able to find some additional funding for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10313.239s">And</a> that's that is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10315.721s">This</a> budget is not a level service budget because there are still cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10320.104s">That</a> is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10321.906s">This</a> budget also does not do that many new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10325.869s">So</a> there are some new things that are happening administratively in terms of properly funding accounts that were underfunded before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10332.134s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10333.195s">There</a> are things happening that I think are really important that are new, but in terms of like new programs that you would be able to see or sort of feel in the schools, there's, there's not much in the way of new programming planned under this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10351.848s">better</a> days ahead on that front as well as we look forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10355.57s">So</a> I am gonna ask if there's anyone who would like to provide comment, please just raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10365.934s">I'm</a> gonna ask you to limit your comments to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10370.935s">And</a> if you could start by giving us your name and address for the record, that would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10376.157s">So</a> if there is anybody who would like to provide comment, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10380.759s">Please</a> put your hand in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10400.527s">Jessica</a> Healy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10422.643s">Superintendent,</a> can you answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10424.464s">Is</a> there a sixth grade special ed teacher at the McGlynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10427.865s">I</a> don't know if you can do that one off the top of your head.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10494.053s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10495.635s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10496.095s">Bowen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10501.781s">Any</a> other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10505.524s">Lily</a> Scott?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10564.309s">Um</a> Lily, I can maybe take a shot at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10566.65s">So</a> there while there were, um, there's a net reduction of three positions in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10574.514s">Um</a> and that includes increases in some places and decreases in other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10579.736s">So</a> the net reduction is three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10582.417s">Um,</a> but that there are additions in various places and, um and offsetting reductions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10590.101s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10591.789s">Yeah,</a> the picture is very complicated, but if you saw the superintendent's memo, I think from Friday night, after the table, there's a good explanation of the reductions happening across the district, but I don't, I can't remember off the top of my head if the additions were focused on there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10610.525s">So</a> you'd have to sort of use the chart and the description to net that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10617.331s">Any</a> other questions, comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10628.884s">Um,</a> for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10631.885s">Is</a> there, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10635.026s">Is</a> there a motion to sever the teachers line item from the budget?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10984.463s">Six</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10987.864s">The</a> FY24-20, the FY25 budget, which comprises the 2024-2025 school year has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10997.506s">We</a> are going to move on to new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10999.631s">Item</a> 2024-29 offered by Member Ruseau is a new policy around capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11006.198s">or</a> it's a codification of our policy that did come out of the strategic and capital planning subcommittee some weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11013.943s">So</a> thank you member Rousseau for writing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11017.865s">It</a> is something that we will have to submit to the MSBA shortly with our capital maintenance and capital planning deliverable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11028.331s">I'm</a> going to read it and then take any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11032.716s">So</a> the school committee will develop a capital improvement plan annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11036.159s">Preparations</a> for annual approval of the capital improvement plan will be scheduled in phases throughout the school year with attention to certain deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11042.806s">So</a> phase one, capital project identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11045.769s">Between</a> September 1st and October 15th, the superintendent will ensure that school building leaders have submitted all outstanding maintenance work in the district-wide ticketing system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11054.515s">Phase</a> 2 strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting target dates October 15th to November 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11059.358s">The</a> strategic and capital planning subcommittee will meet to review and prepare recommendations for the committee of the whole to be held per phase 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11066.522s">The</a> subcommittee will create four lists of projects, capital projects eligible for Community Preservation Act funding, capital projects eligible for net school spending, capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, and D, all capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11082.196s">The</a> subcommittee will prioritize the individual items within each list, and the school committee will forward these artifacts to the committee per phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11090.034s">In</a> phase three, the committee of the whole review and approval will occur between December 1st and December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11096.98s">The</a> committee will review the projects received from phase two, and the committee will report a capital improvement plan to the next regular school committee meeting for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11107.849s">Phase</a> four, school committee approval of the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11113.454s">Oh,</a> give me just one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11114.715s">My</a> computer's gonna die here if I don't plug in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11116.896s">I'm</a> gonna lose you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11120.911s">Okay,</a> here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11122.713s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11124.975s">So</a> the school committee approval of the capital improvement plan and phase four target dates January one to January 31, the school committee will consider approval of the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11134.795s">In</a> phase five, the capital improvement plan will be submitted to the city council, target date January 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11140.359s">The</a> approved school committee capital plan will be forwarded to the city of Medford with a funding request to implement the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11146.624s">Phase</a> six is a publication of the capital improvement plan, which has a target date of February 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11153.809s">The</a> capital improvement plan will be published in the school committee section of the Medford Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11161.474s">And...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11164.33s">Phase</a> seven is inclusion of capital projects eligible for net school spending in the budget request. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11170.413s">Target</a> date, February 1st to February 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11173.835s">All</a> capital projects eligible for net school spending that could be reasonably accomplished within the upcoming fiscal year will be incorporated into the budget request. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11180.739s">All</a> capital projects eligible for net school spending but not included in the budget request will be detailed in the budget request as an attachment and explain why all the projects cannot be reasonably accomplished in the upcoming fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11192.745s">And</a> then phase eight, public school administration submits Community Preservation Committee grant applications with a target date of July 1 to July 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11201.616s">The</a> grant applications eligible for the Community Preservation Act funding shall be submitted to the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11211.561s">So</a> there's a couple of definitions here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11214.605s">One</a> is a definition of the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11216.687s">The</a> capital improvement plan typically consists of one or more capital improvement projects which are financed through a capital budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11222.713s">CIPs</a> are important tools for local governments, allowing them to plan strategically for community growth and transformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11228.633s">A</a> capital improvement project is an asset upgrade or large scale maintenance work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11233.201s">Some</a> examples of capital projects include building a new school, replacing outdated HVAC systems, replacing a roof, or any project above $150,000 per school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11242.83s">The</a> Community Preservation Act is a Massachusetts law passed in 2000, enabling communities to assess a tax on real property for open space protection, historic preservation, affordable housing and outdoor recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11256.558s">The</a> Community Preservation Committee is a committee established by the city council here in Medford to make recommendations for spending of community preservation funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11266.504s">And</a> the Community Preservation Fund is a city established fund to contain the monies raised from taxes for the spending of those funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11273.491s">and</a> then net school spending all funds expended by the school committee via the budget grants or other funds, as well as certain city expenditures such as infrastructure and pensions, excluding certain types of expenditures such as transportation, adult education, and long-term debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11289.905s">So</a> that is the proposed policy that would line up well with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11298.628s">policy</a> that we passed around our budget process just a week ago, I believe, or two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11306.158s">Members,</a> so is there anything else you'd like to say?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11353.219s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11359.062s">Oh,</a> you're on mute.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11541.531s">So</a> this is a policy which requires two readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11547.757s">So</a> somebody can make a motion to approve the first reading and then this would go on the agenda again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11553.622s">Alternatively,</a> somebody can motion to waive the first reading and then we can motion to approve the policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11580.145s">Okay,</a> so there's a motion to waive the first reading by member Labate, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11586.15s">Second</a> by member Branley.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11591.391s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11592.272s">Is</a> that a motion to approve the first reading?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=186.547s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=187.027s">Nine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=188.027s">in</a> the affirmative, zero in the negative, six absent, the minutes are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=195.012s">Okay,</a> so I just wanted to give you all a deliverable status overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=199.876s">So</a> again, we have five, we'll call it six things, but with five official things that have to be done in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=207.282s">The</a> MSBA let us know that our, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=211.525s">ICC</a> has, which is the legal agreement, has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=215.77s">So</a> that is complete and approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=218.492s">We</a> have submitted our SBC form, our school building committee form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=222.296s">They</a> reviewed it and they have approved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=224.699s">So</a> we are done and approved on item number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=228.286s">Um,</a> last meeting, we approved, um, the chapter 74 form as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=233.03s">That</a> one has not been submitted yet, but that is just a matter of, um, collecting up all the paperwork and doing some final editing, and that will be submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=241.115s">Um,</a> item number four is the educational profile, which I am hopeful that we will, um, get to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=249.001s">Um,</a> and then, um, the <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=254.264s">Final</a> pieces include the maintenance plan profile, which we will talk about today and potentially provide an approval by this group to go ahead and submit that as soon as it's complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=265.726s">And</a> then the final big thing that we will have to do there's well there's two more things so there's data from the about enrollment that has to be submitted that is in process does not require approval of this body but we are working with Alicia Hunt as well as Gerry McCue who's our CFO here and are on track to get that completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=287.466s">The</a> very last thing that we will have to do is earmark funds for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=292.27s">So</a> I just wanted to let you all know that you can expect to see that on the city council agenda on the 25th, which is a Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=302.139s">The</a> request will come from the mayor to use free cash to set aside funds for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=311.307s">The</a> exact amount is still <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=314.029s">a</a> little bit of a TBD because there's a little bit more legwork to do to make sure that we get the right number, but we know what that range needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=322.051s">So</a> we have a couple more conversations to have, and then the mayor will make that request to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=327.372s">Hopefully</a> the council will approve that on the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=330.973s">MSBA</a> has already signed off on the language that will go before the council to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=336.014s">They</a> are fine with it and they are ready to watch and hear that that's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=340.536s">They</a> did say that they will schedule our enrollment meeting like once that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=346.38s">And</a> so the fact that we're going to do that in June is good because then we can accelerate that piece of it, which really would position us for a much earlier view by the board than next February, which is when we would sort of be scheduled if we take full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=362.734s">So</a> that's just a quick update. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=366.517s">Are</a> there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=377.847s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=379.628s">The</a> other just like announcement related is that we have finished the first draft of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=386.854s">I'm</a> gonna ask Tom to send that out to everybody after this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=391.817s">So</a> if you wanna take a look, if you have any questions or comments or suggestions, please, by all means, let Tom know what they are and he will work on integrating any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=403.446s">We</a> are on our way there and sort of positioned for being able to use that to start to talk to the community when we are ready for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=414.276s">And</a> then the last thing we did have a subcommittee meeting earmarked for June 20th for the communication subcommittee and that meeting will be canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=428.394s">And</a> I will reach out to the communications team to find another Zoom time for us so we can move forward on some of the preparation things that we were talking about at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=440.184s">But</a> I will tell you for sure it will not happen probably until the beginning of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=448.432s">because</a> I don't have any minutes left in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=450.954s">So</a> I'm sure that's true of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=453.236s">It's</a> June and it's just sort of a full court press. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=456.158s">So</a> we'll spend some time in the summer to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=459.221s">And</a> our summer meetings will be on the schedule unless we are in a true holding pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=464.345s">And</a> in which case I will let you know and we'll cancel those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=467.267s">But</a> my plan is for the summer meetings to be Zoom only so everyone can be where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=472.652s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=474.994s">Is</a> everybody okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=478.976s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=480.677s">OK,</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=481.057s">OK,</a> so on to the next item. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=485.258s">We're</a> going to take a look at the ed profile again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=488.12s">What</a> I did since we last spoke is integrate feedback that I got from lots of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=497.223s">Thank</a> you, Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=498.244s">Thank</a> you, Libby. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=500.305s">Thank</a> you, Luke. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=501.618s">Thank</a> you, Tracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=502.459s">You</a> guys really crushed it in the performing arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=507.182s">And</a> what I wanted to do, what I'm hoping that we can do tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=511.726s">Hey,</a> Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=513.127s">What</a> I'm hoping we can do tonight is sort of collect any additional feedback that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=518.05s">There</a> are some placeholders in here that are contingent on the staff having some time to meet with all the district administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=524.555s">And</a> so what I'm hoping that we can do is, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=528.971s">talk</a> about what we see here, talk about any additional suggestions, agree on the things that are listed here as placeholders, and provide an approval as amended and to be completed so that, you know, and we'll share the final copy with you all, but if you do that, that will give me the leeway to sort of collect up all the last pieces and get this submitted as well, which I would like to do before June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=556.075s">So</a> a couple of big changes that I made, let's see, are start on page... So one big change that I made starts on page eight, which provides a deeper description of the library in its current form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=579.904s">Thank</a> you, Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=582.135s">So</a> that is one change that has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=585.638s">And</a> then there is reference to the library as well, down in the non-traditional and other spaces section. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=600.971s">And</a> then if we fast forward to page 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=612.453s">This</a> is the section that got a really substantive overhaul based on all the things that were provided to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=624.105s">So</a> at the top of page 13 in course spaces, still to be added to this document, just for <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=634.301s">everybody</a> to sort of shake their head and say yes, those are the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=639.132s">There</a> is some discussion about Curtis Tufts that has to go into this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=644.595s">There</a> is discussion about early EEC, early education and childcare, so that is both our Chapter 74 program as well as our MEET programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=655.519s">Kids</a> Corner, which is our daycare program for Medford Public Schools employees, and certainly they are at capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=670.22s">I</a> think there would be no shortage of people interested in that service if there was space to increase enrollment and open that up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=677.822s">And</a> then the final thing that is on the to be added list in core spaces is that that felt integration project that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=685.744s">I</a> know Suzanne was looking for some information about what that said so that we can sort of paint a like sort of paint some broad strokes about that as well in terms of this is our like sort of goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=698.092s">So</a> I'll stop talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=699.053s">Are</a> there any questions, thoughts, changes about the course basis section?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=715.118s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=737.274s">That</a> will all happen in the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=739.316s">So</a> that is some time from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=741.998s">I</a> did, in some places, try to <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=751.508s">sort</a> of describe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=752.889s">And</a> it's probably buried in one of these sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=755.13s">And</a> so what the other thing I'll do is find it and put it at the top of this section as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=764.554s">But</a> yeah, okay, so I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=770.117s">I</a> am making a note that we will add that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=850.447s">So</a> I asked a similar question of MSBA when I spoke with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=855.628s">And</a> what they said was they used information in this section to get a feel for the kind of building we're trying to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=864.69s">So</a> I think that is like an answer and a non-answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=871.291s">And</a> I thought about that, too, as I was pulling in some of Tracy's content. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=879.109s">to</a> bring that to this group because I read it and I was like, I can see what he's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=887.787s">Like</a> I can visualize <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=890.606s">what</a> he's saying when he talks about like the performing arts space in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=897.068s">And</a> so I found it very helpful to read that to get a sense of like, do I agree with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=902.91s">Yes</a> or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=903.39s">I</a> think I did for the, you know, for the by and large, and I'm not an expert in space. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=909.332s">So</a> I was like, Tracy thinks we probably do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=912.853s">So</a> I let I put it in here, sort of with that in mind, which is to say, like, if the if the <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=919.727s">designer</a> or MSBA is trying to understand where our head is at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=926.668s">I</a> think this sufficiently describes how we're currently feeling about the performing arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=931.869s">So</a> Libby and Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of your experience in this space and whether you feel strongly about what's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=944.112s">Is</a> it too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=944.712s">Is</a> it not enough, et cetera?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=949.588s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1037.112s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1037.872s">So</a> if you're signing up for that, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1040.353s">I'll</a> sign up for it with Joan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1044.654s">And</a> so, Luke, I think as you read this, if there are changes in that vein that paint a bigger picture, I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1053.397s">The</a> other thing I think we can use this document for is when we went to Arlington and we walked around a brand new building, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1064.768s">The</a> first thing you saw was like a student-run cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1070.386s">Nobody</a> in this building is like dreaming about a student-run cafe because it's like beyond the scope of what by and large we know to be about high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1082.796s">Like</a> I didn't have a student-run cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1085.038s">You</a> didn't have a student-run cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1086.879s">Those</a> weren't things back when we were kids going to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1090.141s">And</a> we know what's in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1091.523s">And</a> some people probably know like what those options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1093.864s">But</a> I think this is also sort of a nice opportunity for us to say to the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1100.149s">here's</a> this big vision, like here's where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1104.63s">And</a> this is the beginning, because I think it could get juices flowing, which will like feed into the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1112.892s">Luke.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1197.322s">And</a> I think the other thing that is important to remember is that <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1202.608s">There's</a> no requirement even that the school building committee is involved in the creation of this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1207.692s">Like</a> the requirement is that it is submitted by the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1211.795s">So</a> I think it's appropriate for this team to start to like paint a picture for people to react to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1218.681s">So</a> I think I'm okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1220.002s">I'm</a> personally okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1222.043s">I</a> think to the point of like engaging the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1227.57s">I</a> do want to engage the community when there's experts in the room who can do that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1234.992s">I</a> don't want us to be too far out ahead of that process because I think none of us particularly is equipped to do that kind of visioning process with the community in a way that's going to sort of be consistent with what has to happen during feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1251.157s">So</a> I don't want to create a situation where we are <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1257.452s">sort</a> of out over our skis, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1259.994s">So</a> I think like what I would use this document when we sort of get to the point of publishing this to the community, I mean, they can, it's in the meeting documents and everything, but to say like, this is our, this is like the jumping off point that the committee accelerated to <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1277.685s">get</a> us to the place where like the door, we can open the doors to this bigger vision, but we want you to read this and start to think creatively about these spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1287.351s">The</a> important thing is like programming like Curtis Tufts, Curtis Tufts has to sort of say like an enter, this is our, this is like <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1295.997s">is,</a> you know, this is our place to, to describe all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1300.86s">So,</a> and start that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1303.362s">So</a> I think I'm okay with us being sort of visionary in terms of what we know, because as MSBA describes the requirement here is like, this is so that we can start to hear what's important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1315.089s">And</a> I can tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1317.01s">I</a> feel good that the things that we hear about on the school committee all the time are well represented here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1323.832s">Athletics,</a> performing arts, Curtis Tufts, the alternative space for the high school, like all of those things are the, those are the heavy hitter topics for us, generally speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1336.155s">Peter?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1391.817s">Oh,</a> sorry, Larry?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1450.438s">The</a> one in Arlington is like a cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1453.12s">So</a> the one in Arlington is like limited because you can't interfere with the food service program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1459.124s">That's</a> a whole other problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1460.865s">But</a> this what was in Arlington was like a cafe, essentially like coffee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1478.755s">So</a> that's all in the chapter 74 piece in that other form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1483.716s">So</a> it doesn't make a huge appearance here for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1493.799s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1494.139s">So</a> we, I did put something in there just so it doesn't get lost, but the chapter 74 form talks about all of those programs that we're trying to explore and the proposed capacity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1548.013s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1549.034s">I</a> can add something about that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1552.195s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1553.196s">Paul?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1868.396s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1869.778s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1872.38s">Oh,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2051.956s">So</a> that's the work that the administrative team has signed up to do, because they will have to describe the curriculum, the 2B curriculum section of this, which is not complete yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2261.772s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2262.312s">Yeah,</a> so I guess a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2265.734s">I</a> am also here to keep this on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2267.555s">It</a> is like my mission in life to keep this thing on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2273.198s">One</a> of the things that, so I agree with you that we can start to ask those questions in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2278.9s">What</a> I'm unclear about is, are you saying we should not submit this until we've done that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2283.127s">Or</a> are you suggesting that we submit this and then we use that sort of body of information to also feed the consultants that are going to come on?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2318.705s">And</a> so is there something in here that you want to not be in here?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2348.764s">It</a> is asking for core spaces, specialty spaces, and non-traditional spaces that are described above are proposed to be used if known at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2362.253s">Additionally,</a> if there are proposed changes indicate how they will impact space needs and what training to support staff will or may be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2371.892s">That</a> is the question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2398.755s">Bear</a> with me, my brain short-circuited several hours back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2402.998s">Is</a> there something you're proposing to take out? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2405.62s">Like,</a> are there words on the page that you want to take out? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2408.042s">I</a> would say anything that doesn't exist today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2410.724s">Which</a> is?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2427.737s">Anesthesia,</a> like all of these things exist, they just exist poorly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2475.937s">I</a> think what the community wants is to talk in feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2482.439s">And</a> we can't get there unless we agree on how we are going to get this document submitted, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2489.462s">So</a> that is why I'm just trying to be really concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2494.053s">that</a> you what I think what you're saying is there's too much information in items one through 11 on page 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2502.16s">And</a> instead, we should maybe be more broad about what we are thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2507.664s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2558.049s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2559.009s">I</a> also would encourage this group to choose their words carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2563.99s">Like</a> if we start telling people we're disenfranchising them, they will feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2568.691s">And</a> I don't think the community thinks of us that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2571.411s">Like,</a> and so we shouldn't talk that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2576.232s">So</a> I just, I think this stuff does find its own legs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2581.433s">So</a> I, the school committee under its authority <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2588.703s">appointed</a> you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2590.505s">And</a> we're here to like, make sure we don't mess this up, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2594.009s">Because</a> everyone in the city is definitely afraid we are going to mess this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2598.814s">So</a> it's just it's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2602.538s">So</a> we can strike <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2605.183s">item</a> 11, all those other things are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2608.585s">We</a> can make it, like I will go through and make it a little bit less specific, which I think is totally fine and reasonable, so that it does not sound so specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2618.192s">And</a> I think to your point, like when we put out a press release that says these documents are complete, there needs to be some framing of this document as like a starting point by this committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2633.675s">in</a> meetings open to the public, it's tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2636.656s">It's</a> like May and June, like there's not a whole lot of time in the community for people to be with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2641.677s">But</a> the entire point of this was to like collect all the feedback that we've heard all along the way, pair it up with like the teaching and learning methodology and get us sort of off to the races. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2653.52s">And</a> that, to me, that is what we're here to do in eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2658.281s">So</a> I think we're still on track to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2661.962s">And</a> so I think the other place where there is some like real description here is around the library media space. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2670.784s">But</a> I would also say, I don't see anything in here that doesn't sort of match the description of current in some way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2680.167s">So</a> there's some description of like what the current state is that Maria put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2684.328s">And</a> then there is the description of the like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2688.666s">the</a> ideal space and other than a restroom close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2695.791s">And</a> movable walls. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2699.233s">I</a> think other than that, we are fairly saying something about how we're envisioning and actually with the luxury of our head librarian doing that for us, that this is sort of what we're envisioning that space to become. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2715.879s">So</a> that was the other place where I thought it was very detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2721.083s">And</a> so I don't know if anybody saw anything else that they thought was maybe too detailed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2779.902s">That</a> will all be cleaned up before this is done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2816.676s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2817.937s">Yeah,</a> all of that is a sort of a wacky template to work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2824.182s">And</a> it has like all kinds of different bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2826.304s">So</a> all of that will be cleaned up before we're done to make sure that it's consistent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2846.236s">That's</a> totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2846.976s">That's</a> totally fine.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2862.938s">Are</a> there questions about section three? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2867.427s">Aaron?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2895.519s">I</a> think we're just, I think what I'm hearing is to just bring everything up to the same level of detail.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2901.503s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3042.699s">Yep,</a> and Suzanne was working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3045.96s">Tracking</a> down that application that went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3049.401s">Some</a> years ago now to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3053.643s">It</a> was very project based learning integration with the outdoors oriented for another grant that we did not get, but she was going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3064.506s">Go</a> through the files and we had information to figure out if there's anything that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3130.114s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3131.034s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3132.794s">Any</a> other questions, comments?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3159.237s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3159.618s">Brian?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3167.229s">Um</a> so we talked about Arlington, we talked about Somerville, Belmont, okay and you know the other you know the thing we may want to do is sort of reformat our summer meetings to be like tours instead so that we have some time in summer to do various tours so um <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3193.241s">I</a> think that would be a great use of summer if we can get all of these documents, if we can get through all of these documents so that we really can sort of take the summer to put all of our like communication plans together, start to tell the community what we're saying, start to look at all those other schools and sort of get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3210.693s">So</a> it might just be nice timing to do all of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3275.683s">Section</a> four, community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3277.204s">I</a> think the last time we talked, people talked about the sequencing of the information in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3288.351s">And</a> I tried to, although I'm finding the typos because I was doing this in my lap at the council meeting last night, but I did try to like re-sequence this to better flow with the information that we have in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3301.748s">So</a> talking about the communications and community engagement subcommittee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3308.01s">I</a> think it was last and then talking about some of the things specifically that they asked about around, you know, what kinds of things are we considering doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3318.294s">And</a> then, in addition, doing a little bit of sort of just framing that last paragraph a little bit better about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3326.437s">the</a> engagement that we've already done around the co-location of Curtis Tufts because that is a program that we are proposing to bring on here and the school committee has done some very helpful useful work to sort of move that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3338.506s">So</a> that is, I think that is everything in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3352.415s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3358.724s">Um,</a> is there a motion to approve this document as amended and to be completed as noted?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3383.601s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3387.09s">Okay,</a> so a motion by Dr. Cushing and Aaron, seconded by Aaron. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3398.273s">All</a> of our voting members are in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3401.354s">So</a> all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3404.715s">All</a> those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3406.996s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3408.556s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3421.483s">I</a> can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3424.444s">Okay,</a> the last item on our agenda for this evening is just to give you an update on the maintenance practices information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3435.428s">So,</a> Dr. Cushing, so let me pass this out and then I'll explain what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3475.134s">Okay,</a> does everyone have a coffee? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3476.735s">Oh,</a> we're almost there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3478.975s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3481.236s">Okay,</a> so just as framing, the MSBA has an online portal where they require us to upload a whole variety of documents around our maintenance and capital planning practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3496.251s">Earlier</a> in this process, Tom and I sat down with that system and we went through and we created this document to just try to provide like a working place for all of that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3512.425s">So</a> you'll see all the questions listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3517.349s">throughout</a> this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3520.573s">And</a> what you'll see is the questions, the answer format. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3524.638s">So</a> many of these things are like yes, no type questions, and then any comments, which would be comments that we need to put into the system to answer the question, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3535.485s">Um,</a> so if we start at the top, what I think you'll see is that the vast majority of this information has to be completed by Dr. Cushing, who's our representative on the committee in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3551.553s">his</a> work as the overseer of the facilities department for Medford Public Schools, among other 45 other jobs that he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3561.003s">But</a> I think I just wanted to run through the questions here as a sort of jumping off point and talk a little bit about, you know, give you all a chance to review all the information that <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3576.447s">is</a> populated in here already and talk about next steps for this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3582.41s">So</a> if we start at the top, the first series of questions is really around staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3586.332s">So</a> it asks about, question number one is, is the facility maintenance performed by the municipality or the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3594.375s">In</a> our situation, it's a combination of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3597.415s">So</a> the districts largely has the responsibility for sort of all things maintenance until something gets too big and becomes a capital project and then the city does step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3609.585s">Our</a> buildings and grounds department clears snow and they do other projects like paving and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3615.851s">So</a> it is truly a group effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3618.469s">Item</a> number two, are vendors used for any aspect of facilities maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3622.771s">And</a> the answer to that is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3624.953s">For</a> all of these things, plumbing, pest management, elevator inspections, asbestos testing, et cetera, fire alarm systems, all of that good stuff.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3639.06s">Number</a> three, full-time equivalent, to help them understand how many custodians we have across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3648.73s">Is</a> there a director of facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3650.131s">The</a> answer to that is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3651.833s">And</a> does the district have defined job descriptions for our custodial staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3657.218s">And</a> the answer is yes, so we'll have to attach those. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3660.78s">Um,</a> item number six is their system of performance evaluations of the district's custodial and maintenance staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3667.665s">Um,</a> that is a work in progress, but, uh, we are, uh, pending contract negotiations around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3677.071s">And,</a> um, number seven is training required or provided for the district's custodial and maintenance staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3682.675s">Um,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3683.456s">And</a> we cover some of the things that we have, um, trained our staff in starting in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3690.656s">And</a> then number eight is their written maintenance plan for the district that details minimum custodial maintenance standards and governs day to day operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3699.861s">The</a> answer to that is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3701.822s">And</a> so we will have to attach those documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3703.923s">So</a> that's the staffing section, the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3708.354s">Is</a> there a preventive or predictive maintenance plan for the district's facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3713.019s">The</a> answer to that is yes, and there's an attachment that we'll have to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3718.225s">Does</a> the district have a work order system? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3720.187s">The</a> answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3721.248s">We</a> actually recently converted from email work order system, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3727.458s">problematic,</a> as you might mention, to a system called operations hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3734.484s">And</a> it is a true work order ticketing system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3737.707s">And</a> we the district is sort of rolling folks onto that both on the custodial staff and then also in the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3745.993s">Over</a> the course, there's working on that implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3749.736s">The</a> facilities condition index <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3752.751s">question</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3753.411s">Does</a> the district conduct periodic inspections of school facilities to ascertain their conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3757.874s">The</a> answer to that is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3759.956s">Um,</a> item number two is do we have a facilities condition index which keeps track of school systems, identifies major system components and tracks information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3773.084s">Um,</a> we purchased some software to begin doing that in February of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3776.947s">That's</a> operation hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3777.808s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3782.066s">item</a> number three, please describe how the district analyzes facility condition information and how that analysis impacts decisions on budget capital improvements and staff performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3792.819s">So</a> up until recently, the facility conditions and repairs were done on an as-needed basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3801.229s">the</a> district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3803.47s">So</a> beginning in FY 24, we've really begun to shift to a recommissioning model where we are looking at each of our schools on a periodic basis to understand their budgetary needs, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3816.876s">Item</a> number four, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3818.637s">is</a> do we have a protocol around commissioning and recommissioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3822.42s">That</a> is starting in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3826.162s">And</a> that process is essentially on a periodic basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3830.385s">You</a> do sort of a soup to nuts assessment of what is happening in the building so that you can identify what it would take to bring the building back to its original condition in terms of its intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3841.632s">And</a> then what that does is it sort of highlights any maintenance <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3846.515s">practices</a> that need to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3848.977s">HVAC</a> can, you know, the big systems there are like HVAC oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3853.621s">You</a> may or may not know this, but we have a project going on right now in our middle schools that will replace HVAC systems in the Andrews Middle School and then in the entire McGlynn complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3863.788s">So</a> those buildings are like in effect being reconditioned because of that substantive work, which is scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3872.294s">Hopefully</a> by next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3873.816s">Next</a> summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3874.336s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3876.605s">And</a> the other schools, Brooks, Roberts, Missittuck, will get on to the reconditioning cycle with this next rehab. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3885.929s">And</a> then the expectation would be the high school would go on to like a five-year loop with the other schools as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3977.055s">So,</a> so yes, yes to both of those things right like proactive maintenance like extends the life of these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3986.482s">But</a> there is a life of the system that you know you you tap out and I think what you see, particularly when you talk when you start to think about like that's kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3997.179s">system</a> programming that's going to go into this new high school like Arlington talked a lot about how like they don't know how to use their building just yet because it is so highly technical and so very different than how their building used to operate that they said often they hear they are like this thing is broken and it's not broken at all they just don't know how to use it yet right and so there's this huge learning curve that goes into these these new buildings in particular <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4024.927s">But,</a> you know, for the same reason that like <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4028.106s">when</a> your car is like fully electrified inside, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4032.429s">Like</a> there's more parts, there's more things that can go wrong, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4037.073s">There's</a> more, there's more, well, if you're completely electric, that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4041.196s">But</a> like you start talking about like even the advancement of anything else that's going on in your home, like you're, you know, the refrigerator from the 70s lasted for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4051.623s">And</a> it's still, maybe it's still running in avocado green, but <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4055.816s">If</a> you buy a refrigerator 10 years ago, you're probably thinking about it's time for a new refrigerator. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4061.978s">So</a> the entire way we maintain our buildings will change with this new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4068.039s">And</a> I think what they're trying to understand is, how do we do it today? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4072.1s">So</a> how big of a climb is this going to be for us to take good care of this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4077.181s">And</a> the answer is, we have work to do in that department, for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4083.363s">we</a> are trying to get there proactively so that we have arrived by the time this building comes on because that's going to be its own challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4093.549s">The</a> environment question, does the district routinely monitor air quality? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4098.672s">The</a> answer to that is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4101.594s">Does</a> the district implement practices in the EPA's Tools for Schools program? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4106.537s">The</a> answer is yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4114.18s">Does</a> the district have a protocol to eliminate toxic chemicals and use green products for cleaning and repairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4121.205s">Best</a> practices for building operators typically include regular inspecting, testing, balancing, and cleaning of HVAC components in order to make them most efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4128.891s">Do</a> we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4130.672s">I</a> think that's like maybe a working yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4134.655s">Does</a> the district monitor energy consumption and spending? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4137.537s">We</a> do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4143.081s">It</a> is a very interesting analysis.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4168.462s">With</a> outside testing, yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4459.45s">We</a> have a maintenance department.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4465.941s">Got</a> it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4591.494s">Well,</a> you know, you're being recorded, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4602.837s">Also</a> in this document is a series of questions about budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4607.639s">So</a> does the facility maintenance person have a role in establishing the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4611.981s">What</a> are the amounts that have been requested in the budget over a series of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4618.103s">What</a> was allocated in the budget over a series of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4621.244s">If</a> there is a variance, why was there a variance? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4625.426s">Expended</a> budget over a series of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4632.196s">Is</a> there a variance? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4633.998s">If</a> there's a variance of 20% or greater between consecutive years and the district's total expended amounts, please provide the details on the reason for the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4642.02s">projected</a> budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4643.601s">I</a> think we're actually on a better track there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4645.581s">So</a> that is nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4647.582s">What</a> does the district believe that the appropriate amount of spending on operations and maintenance should be to allow for routine maintenance of those facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4656.104s">And</a> how close are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4657.165s">So</a> we had lots of conversation at the council meeting last night, in particular, because <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4666.801s">that</a> there are potential Proposition 2.5 overrides on the ballot in November, voted in last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4677.303s">And</a> part of all of that money, $7.5 million across the two ballot measures, other than $500,000, would be directed towards schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4688.189s">A</a> big part of the planning that went into those numbers was things like making sure that we're able to provide routine maintenance that supports the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4697.013s">So</a> that's a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4698.721s">Um,</a> and then any other comments on your budget history, so we will talk about those upcoming items. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4705.384s">Then</a> there's a capital program piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4707.845s">We're</a> in good shape from a capital program perspective because the city, we had a capital program for several years when Mayor Lungo-Koehn <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4716.613s">took</a> the reins of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4718.135s">She</a> created an integrated capital plan that included the schools and they use the calling center to help establish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4728.185s">And</a> then we are in the midst of a policy change on the school committee side to sort of codify our annual capital planning review process for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4739.897s">And</a> then the capital budget history asks about tax overrides, capital exclusions, debt exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4747.401s">The</a> answer to all of those is we have not done that before, but we're about to do it in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4753.404s">And</a> then any other capital projects that were deferred due to funding constraints, so I'm sure that we will have one or two items in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4763.002s">The</a> final section is the capital improvement plan and budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4767.404s">So</a> what is you know what is our capital improvement plan and budget so we will attach the city's capital improvement plan and some of the other documents that we have internally and then provide any information about availability of non public funds for school facility purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4782.51s">We'll</a> talk about our rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4784.621s">and</a> some other things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4786.923s">And</a> then provide information from the treasurer finance committee or capital planning committee regarding the outstanding debt and future bond capacity inside the debt limit for municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4796.93s">And</a> so that will come from the bankers office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4800.727s">And</a> then this last table was just a table, one of the tables that have to be sort of filled out and completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4807.089s">So</a> all this document is really just to allow us to start to collect the information where that ultimately then has to be like keyed into the system in a very particular way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4819.654s">So</a> I wanted to share this with you, find out if you have questions or comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4825.126s">Our</a> working goal is again that by June 30th this will be done and we will be able to submit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4832.474s">We</a> actually have until I think October to do this, but we can't go to that next phase in the process until we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4837.899s">So</a> our goal is to get all of this documentation pulled together and buttoned up between now and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4844.065s">So</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4849.193s">Um,</a> would anybody like to make a motion to authorize Dr. Cushing and I to complete and submit the questionnaire? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4862.561s">Okay,</a> so motion for myself and Dr. Cushing to complete this questionnaire as requested by Nicole Morell, seconded by Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4875.509s">Thank</a> you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4879.639s">Okay,</a> all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4881.883s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4882.565s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4884.588s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4885.15s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4891.28s">We</a> are at the end of our agenda, a few minutes early. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4895.122s">Our</a> next full meeting is scheduled at six o'clock on July 17th via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4901.006s">I</a> will be in touch with the communications committee so that we can find another date hopefully in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4906.109s">And</a> I think the next steps are to finish up these forms and get everything submitted and look forward to that feasibility study vote by the council on the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4919.297s">Um,</a> so that we are sort of off to the races and then, you know, use the summer to do our community engagement planning and do some touring. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4930.205s">So</a> between now and July 1st, I'm going to say I will be back in touch with you if I am able to sort of shift things around and schedule some dates and times. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4939.432s">So</a> those two meetings may not stay on the calendar exactly as they are, but I will let you know as soon as I have ideas and plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4948.482s">Generally</a> speaking, if we're going to go to a school in the summer, I think their folks are going to lean toward wanting to host us, not in the evenings, is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4963.322s">time</a> frame that works better for you all than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4968.527s">I'm</a> assuming it's summer, it's going to be sort of a Monday to Friday ish thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4973.853s">And</a> probably they're going to ask for us not to come from six to eight, but I will certainly ask if that's a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4980.359s">So</a> is there other other times like, generally speaking that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4985.834s">Is</a> morning better than afternoon? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4987.275s">Is</a> afternoon better than lunchtime? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4988.976s">Is</a> lunchtime the best? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4991.037s">Any</a> feedback about scheduling? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4992.658s">I</a> know it's all impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4995.8s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5028.193s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5030.316s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5031.577s">Any</a> other questions, comments about timing and scheduling? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5036.702s">I</a> know it's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5038.128s">So</a> like I said, I will ask if there are people willing to host us on an evening, and maybe there's evening programming going on in the building where somebody would be willing to do that, or the architects would be willing, the designers often are willing to sort of help make those things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5052.933s">So</a> I will do some outreach and be in touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5057.835s">I'm</a> sure the HMFH would be very happy to take a group back to Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5063.377s">I</a> know some of you got to see Arlington, <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5066.438s">It</a> was just right next door, which is amazing and was very cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5070.839s">So</a> I will be in touch on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5073.84s">And</a> as soon as I have dates, I will have Lisa send them out to you all so that you have them on your calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5079.141s">And</a> you all should have district email now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5083.342s">If</a> you have questions about that, you can see Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5088.463s">And</a> is there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5091.824s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Luke.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9992.153s">Jenny</a> Graham, 7 Ronalee Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9994.376s">I</a> am the vice chair of the school committee, and I just wanted to let you all know that every time we look at a budget we have a chance to look into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10003.275s">When</a> we looked at the FY21 budget, we looked into a future where the Medford Public Schools was the only department in the entire city to say goodbye to humans who worked in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10014.061s">And</a> when we looked at the FY22 budget, we said, okay, things are better. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10022.065s">But</a> also we had an inordinate amount of need that we had never seen before due to the recovery of students from the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10031.21s">I</a> don't remember FY23, so I think that means it was like a not noteworthy year, meaning we weren't at the brink of crisis, but also nothing was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10041.612s">When</a> we looked at the FY24 budget, we looked forward and we said, this budget is incredibly fragile. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10048.653s">Those</a> are words that we used on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10052.014s">We</a> also said that we would be using and exhausting our remaining ESSER funds to do what the city budget could not do for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10059.895s">So</a> when I look forward to the FY 25 budget, the budget proposed by the mayor, which includes work done by myself and others on the task force, it restores most much of the ask that we put forward to you all a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10075.833s">It</a> is not everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10077.679s">That</a> is sort of what compromise is all about, that everyone leaves just a little bit unhappy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10083.743s">And</a> so we do have work to do on the school side once this number passes, whatever that number is, to reconcile. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10091.328s">But</a> when we looked forward, we saw a very bleak picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10094.931s">We</a> saw a destination of the leadership team of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10099.033s">We</a> saw the elimination of six secretaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10101.655s">We</a> saw the elimination of many school teachers, four nurses, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10107.879s">We</a> also were looking forward at an unknown number of $2.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10112.261s">So</a> to Anthony Guillen's point, the time is now to vote on this budget, because once you do, we have work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10120.683s">And</a> there's a whole bunch of humans who are waiting anxiously for that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10125.745s">The</a> school department is aware that this number is out on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10129.794s">and</a> I would ask that you move on this tonight because it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10134.76s">The</a> other thing I'll say is when I look into the future, I'm excited to fund budgets that say yes to the fire station that our firefighters deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10143.851s">They</a> have been waiting and they deserve to work in conditions that are <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10149.637s">not</a> substandard. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10151.458s">They</a> deserve to work in a state-of-the-art facility just like our police do, just like our library does, just like I hope someday our students will and our teachers will. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10163.382s">And</a> I look forward to saying yes to an amount of money for Bedford Public Schools that allows us not just to pull back from the brink, but also to say what do we need for the future so that we can say yes to pay equity for our paraprofessionals, <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10179.628s">so</a> that we can fix the high school schedule, that we can increase the access to the arts and so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10185.0s">Yes,</a> yes, yes is my answer to those three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10188.662s">I'm</a> happy to talk to anybody who wants to talk about those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10192.445s">And</a> the last thing I will say is thank you for being decisive tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10197.287s">It's</a> very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10198.548s">And</a> most importantly, I look forward to talking to all the residents about what those possibilities mean for us in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10205.432s">The</a> last thing I'll say is that- This is the second last thing you say, but I'll give you 15 more seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10209.015s">Okay,</a> I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10210.676s">The</a> last thing I'll say is that the MSBA building committee is working very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10215.098s">I</a> expect that you will see a request for free cash in your next meeting to fund the feasibility study, which is a critical step in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10223.043s">And</a> in addition, when we talk about free cash, the other thing that is very much on topic in the school committee meetings is the many millions of dollars, I think north of 20, that are required to rehab the HVAC systems in both the Andrews <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10235.43s">and</a> the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10236.291s">So</a> all of that forthcoming to many people's questions about free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10240.754s">So</a> those are one-time funds, one-time expenditures, and you can look forward to those at your doorstep soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10245.838s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5028.251s">I</a> see here that you're also requesting that we support an administrative action review to strengthen school district tobacco policies to ensure that e-cigarettes, vaping, nicotine pouches are fully addressed in a preventative and restorative approaches that focus on health outcomes consistent with our mission to support students in the schoolhouse and provide opportunities for community dialogue on health risks of all tobacco and nicotine use. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5053.223s">and</a> encourage campuses to promote health messaging to educators, students, and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5058.624s">I</a> am fully on board with that, but I want to remind everybody that we have a suspension policy that limits our use of out-of-school suspension as a disciplinary measure to a series of criteria that were laid out in the memo by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5075.967s">And</a> this is not on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5079.547s">And</a> I just want to call that out because I have heard <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5083.064s">situations</a> where students are being suspended for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5086.006s">And</a> I just want to say that suspending a kid so they can go home and vape is not the answer to tightening up our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5096.553s">So</a> I'm in support of this and happy to otherwise make a motion to recommend that we support the tobacco and nicotine free generation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5829.146s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules and take item 2024-28 out of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5922.648s">Mayor,</a> I just had a couple of questions or potential amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5927.895s">Sarah</a> Silver, PB): Um, so I would like to maybe amend the motion to approve with the addition of a meeting on Monday, June 9 Sarah Silver, PB): We inevitably cannot get out of June with two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5943.769s">It's</a> just not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5945.25s">So</a> I would rather <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5946.914s">see</a> us have the time scheduled and decide we don't need it, then be left scrambling for a date, which we're actively doing right now to do the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5956.258s">And</a> we're like running out of days in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5958.699s">And</a> there's a lot of people like waiting with bated breath to hear what we have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5961.801s">So</a> one amendment would be the addition of June 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5966.763s">And</a> I would also like to propose that we put the two budget hearings on this calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5972.225s">And</a> my proposal would be <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5974.681s">Wednesday,</a> February 26 and Wednesday, April 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5980.125s">And</a> I picked those Wednesdays because those are the weeks immediately following February and April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5986.348s">So</a> I feel like a Monday budget meeting would <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5989.429s">A,</a> be really hard for the administration to get ready for, but B, would be really hard for people to motivate to get to from a public perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5998.535s">So</a> in keeping with the resolution that we just passed, those would work within the timeline that we established, but I would like to see them just be added right to the calendar so that we can all put them in our calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6013.826s">And</a> if there's something that we decide that we don't need, <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6017.108s">That</a> would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6018.189s">But</a> also we sort of crush into the end of the year and there's not enough time to do all the things that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6023.493s">So</a> I was hoping we could maybe add those few things so that we can chart a slightly better, less chaotic course next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6034.16s">It</a> would be 226 for the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6036.582s">A</a> second budget hearing sort of if required on 430. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6045.273s">And</a> I would say if required, because there's some language about when we would do a second budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6053.617s">And</a> whoever is typing, could you just put if required right next to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6063.162s">Is</a> it you, Dr. Eby? <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6067.804s">It's</a> Lisa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6071.852s">Oh,</a> I was like, who's typing? <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6074.874s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6076.496s">And</a> then the other budget meeting to add to the calendar would be June 9th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6095.671s">That</a> June 9th wouldn't be a budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6097.452s">It's</a> just a regular meeting.<h2><a href="../2024-06-05_dFRUMZnF2Cc/2024-06-05_dFRUMZnF2Cc.html">MCHSBC Full Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=677.111s">Okay,</a> so as I was saying, I don't know what you all were able to hear, so I'm just going to repeat what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=684.299s">The</a> finance subcommittee was streamed to YouTube, so if you weren't at the meeting, I would encourage you to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=692.167s">Alicia</a> Hunt from our planning office joined us, and we had a good conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=698.86s">potential</a> sites for the high school should this site not be the one that is desirable from a planner's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=707.727s">So</a> it just was like a really sort of interesting conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=711.49s">Particularly,</a> we talked a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=712.971s">We</a> talked a little bit about transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=714.813s">And</a> her planner's hat says that transportation should not be the reason we do or don't do something with the building, because transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=728.993s">can</a> be moved to align with where the building ultimately resides. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=734.338s">So</a> just like good information, more sort of like fact finding and starting to engage the right people that I would recommend everybody listen to if they have a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=745.007s">There</a> are two amendments that do need to be made to correctly list Nicole Morell in both the minutes and in the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=756.12s">And</a> then other than that, I will look for a motion to approve the consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=761.603s">There</a> are no other objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=765.726s">Motion</a> approved by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=772.971s">Okay,</a> roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=776.253s">Jenny</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=777.514s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=779.475s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=780.856s">Suzanne</a> Galusi, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=783.957s">Dr.</a> Cushion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=784.598s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=785.558s">Marta</a> Cabral? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=787.04s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=788.541s">Libby</a> Brown? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=789.642s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=790.782s">Marissa</a> Desmond? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=792.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=793.264s">Maria</a> Dorsey? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=794.405s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=794.926s">Brian</a> Hilliard? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=795.806s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=796.907s">Tracy</a> Keene? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=797.788s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=798.148s">Emily</a> Lazzaro?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=893.88s">Yeah,</a> I think we'll do this more than one time because right now, again, we're like in the middle of the paperwork phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=900.526s">I</a> just thought it might be helpful at a high level, but when we start talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=905.367s">you</a> know, when we start getting into the place where we're talking about design and feasibility, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to do that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=911.332s">There</a> will be lots of opportunities even for the community to come in and do that as part of the communication plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=916.316s">So</a> yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=919.138s">But,</a> uh, and certainly if you want to come in before then just let me know and I'll have I'll arrange it with somebody to give you a personal tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=929.306s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=931.728s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=935.676s">Okay,</a> so we're gonna go on a little walking tour here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3754.553s">So</a> we just got back from a brief walking tour of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3760.416s">We</a> saw just like a little bit of everything, just to give people some perspective on what all this building is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3768.18s">And</a> you know, it's pluses and minuses, I guess I'll say, and we'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3773.562s">Plus,</a> we have lots of marble at our disposal, minus, you know, many minuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3779.345s">So</a> having... <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3786.078s">Okay,</a> the next item on our agenda is to take a look at our chapter 74 viability form, which we looked at last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3799.042s">So</a> it's in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3800.142s">I</a> sent it, we sent it out yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3805.214s">We</a> at our 520 school committee meeting, Chad and Dr. Cushing presented to the school committee about some things that they would like to see us study from an expansion perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3820.421s">So</a> there are four programs, auto, electrical, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3827.119s">cosmetology</a> and health assisting that are current programs here that are space constrained. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3833.463s">So</a> we are, we, the school committee unanimously approved that we study an expansion of those programs from a space perspective when we get to the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3845.167s">And</a> in addition, the school committee approved that we study dental assisting, veterinary science, criminal justice and protective services, plumbing and HVAC, and information systems, networking, cybersecurity, all as separate vocations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3865.298s">So</a> five new vocational programs under study from a space perspective for the vocational school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3872.361s">So</a> the school, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3874.907s">MSBA</a> requires that we follow all the rules and regs that DESE has around Chapter 74 programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3882.09s">So</a> they all require licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3884.111s">They</a> all require like all the things that would normally have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3888.293s">They</a> also will ask DESE to weigh in on us studying these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3892.235s">So</a> there's a variety of criteria, including that there's demand in the area for those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3899.237s">and</a> that the school committee is in support of studying those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3903.201s">So</a> we've checked all of those boxes, that presentation and the vote and the minutes will be sent to MSBA with this form. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3913.089s">But</a> I wanted to bring this form back to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3918.414s">I</a> did talk to our contact at MSBA this morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3923.911s">We</a> are not required to take votes on these eligibility program documents as the school building committee, but I think it's important that this group provide their input and weigh in and take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3934.455s">So</a> I would like to see us do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3937.257s">My</a> hope is that if you all have any comments tonight, having reviewed this, we can take a vote to approve this document as amended, and then we will submit this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3948.441s">So</a> I just wanted to open the floor in case anybody had questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3952.782s">comments,</a> thoughts about what is here, before we move any sort of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3960.327s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3982.79s">I</a> was like, auditorium, auditorium is ringing a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3985.613s">Okay,</a> sorry, this is the chapter 74 one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3988.758s">Yes,</a> we reviewed it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3990.26s">And</a> since then, or not last week, but at our last meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3998.23s">Since</a> then, all the information has been filled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4002.113s">Our</a> proposed capacity information has been fleshed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4007.737s">We've</a> noted the school committee's support for the new programs and finished filling out the rest of this form. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4014.682s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other questions about this document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4123.157s">Because</a> we don't function like a standalone vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4126.979s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4169.849s">So,</a> um, I think the other sort of thing because we had this actually this conversation like very early like back in February, the first time we met, where I was like, Hey guys I need you to like really think about all these things and fill out these forms and like, we need to do a lickety split, so they haven't like kicked me out of their office just yet which is nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4190.123s">but</a> we had this conversation and I think there's like the other variables are you know yes MSBA is going to pay for a portion of the building but we also as a community are going to pay for a portion of the building and it's a much more complicated story to tell to say we're going to make it bigger than our students need and we're going to pay for that at a hundred percent because our enrollment certification won't support <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4216.452s">to</a> be enrollment from other districts, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4218.974s">So</a> that's sort of the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4221.797s">And</a> so we actually sort of stayed towards like the current model of if there's capacity, we would continue to take students like Chad does. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4231.525s">And</a> with the expansion, like the expansion that we're talking about and the new programming, I think we could see again that there's capacity across the programming, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4241.014s">It's</a> a little bit hard to say I think but that was sort of the calculus as we were thinking about how like the point of view to take to put this stuff together which was like we felt like it would be too hard of a sell to the community to say let's pay 100% for the extra space <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4259.52s">for</a> programming to tuition in which may or may not ultimately sort of get us where we need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4267.565s">So</a> that was the conversation that we had certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4272.607s">That</a> is just like one point of view, but that was sort of where we landed as we put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4283.203s">Other</a> questions, comments, concerns?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4297.45s">This</a> is the Chapter 74 form? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4301.051s">No,</a> no, you're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4301.732s">We'll</a> get to you in just one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4306.054s">So</a> are there any other Chapter 74 questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4325.856s">Yeah,</a> so there's a motion on the floor to approve this document by Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4330.117s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4331.658s">Second</a> by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4333.919s">Oh,</a> hold on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4341.225s">I</a> feel like I could almost do it, but I wrote in my brand new notebook in the front, so I remember you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4348.027s">OK,</a> Jenny Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4349.407s">Mary</a> Lungo-Koehn, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4351.147s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4353.348s">Dr.</a> Galussi, absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4354.789s">Right</a> behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4355.489s">Dr.</a> Galussi.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4514.046s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4517.367s">I'm</a> guessing it's, yeah, the vocational piece.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4525.618s">Was</a> it an agricultural school at any time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4527.499s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4527.72s">We</a> would love that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4581.078s">OK,</a> so we can double check the square footage of Medford High and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4590.112s">Question</a> B really talks about how students move through the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4594.796s">So</a> this talks about, you know, they're wanting to know things like, is it a lottery? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4600.861s">Is</a> it a neighborhood school? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4602.242s">How</a> do you move from fifth to sixth? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4604.104s">So</a> this narrative talks about our four elementary schools, you know, how many schools we have, and it talks about the transitions from five to six being a lottery for the two middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4617.875s">everybody</a> comes to Medford High and then it does talk a little bit about the freshman exploratory program as well as like how students pick into a CTE program if they're desired and then it sort of references the wait list and references our chapter 74 form. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4634.439s">So</a> it's just really to give the folks that are trying to get a feel for our district like how do students move about the district all the time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4672.864s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4673.345s">Section</a> two, this is where you'll see sort of the, again, current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4679.533s">How</a> many classrooms are considered each of these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4684.495s">Um,</a> so thank you to Marta and her team, among others who went through and counted all the spaces in the building to say, like, here are all the things that are happening in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4699.669s">We</a> will do another review of this, but this is just to sort of tally up all of the spaces that exist in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4709.257s">Um,</a> and then <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4711.587s">In</a> a related question, item B talks about like, how are these spaces currently used? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4718.973s">And</a> there is a narrative around, as the form requests, course spaces, specialized spaces, non-traditional spaces, and class policy, class five policy, all of which are requested in the question in the form.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4775.059s">Maria?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4775.419s">The</a> medium of the library?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4790.586s">Yes,</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4792.327s">So</a> can I send this to you and have you make some edits to it and send it back to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4797.789s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4799.31s">Thank</a> you, Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4805.791s">Any</a> other questions about the information in item B? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4814.637s">We</a> also talk a little bit on the top of page seven about <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4820.35s">the</a> some of the rentals that happen with our community partners, as well as the central office being housed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4827.873s">And</a> all of the all of the administrative offices, the administrative offices, I believe, are another thing where they're not considered part of the school from a reimbursement perspective, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4839.797s">There</a> obviously has to be an administrative space available to operate the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4846.301s">So,</a> you know, there's any number of questions about how that could happen in our like new reconfigured space, whether they stay where they are or they. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4856.868s">perhaps</a> move to the Curtis-Tufts because we want to co-locate the Curtis-Tufts program on this campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4863.191s">So</a> there's any number of things that the feasibility study will look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4866.832s">And</a> so the important thing for us is just to say, yes, the administrative offices are housed in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4871.994s">And</a> at the end of all of this, they need a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4874.755s">So</a> any questions about B? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4883.303s">Um</a> item c again current state what is our current <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4888.883s">teaching</a> methodology, class size policies, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4893.725s">So</a> this is a description, thank you to the administrative team who has taken a lot of time to try to be complete and comprehensive about both like the teaching methodology and some of the specialized programming we have within the building, including the TLP program, the transitions program, our English learners, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4919.19s">et</a> cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4919.85s">We</a> do have some conversation about technology in this section, and then some of the things that are quite limiting around reliable connectivity access to the internet, et cetera, at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4931.438s">Any</a> questions about this so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4935.36s">Okay,</a> section three, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4948.11s">is</a> about what are we proposing? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4952.014s">What</a> is it that we want to see in this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4955.717s">I</a> did have a conversation with our MSBA contact today and <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4961.045s">we</a> did I did ask some questions about what sort of the finality of what is in this document and she assured me that this is like a jumping off point so that MSBA can get a feel for the kind of building we're envisioning and that whoever we ultimately bring on as an owner's project manager or to do a feasibility study can start to learn about us through these documents that we've had to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4985.623s">And</a> the reason I was asking is because I did have a chance to go to Arlington and perhaps sometime this summer we'll try to schedule another tour with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4994.067s">There</a> were spaces in the high school that like if you asked us to fill out a document today to say what should be in this high school, like we couldn't envision that space because it's just not something any of us have ever like seen or considered as an option because it doesn't exist here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5010.533s">So</a> I wanted to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5014.662s">what</a> we put here doesn't limit the thinking of the people who are coming in who build school buildings for a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5020.044s">And</a> they assured me that, no, this is a jumping off point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5024.565s">Very</a> much, they want to know sort of where our head is at and what they're thinking about and what we're thinking about, but also that all of that visioning will happen led by the folks doing the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5036.95s">So</a> those designers will really sort of lead that charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5041.391s">The</a> other conversation that I had today was with one of our Medford High School nurses and our district physician, and they reached out knowing that we were sort of in this pipeline and process to ask about whether we should be trying to provide space for an in-school health clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5064.504s">And</a> they talked about, Dr. Sabia talked about some of the programs that he is part of in Malden, in Everett, and in Revere, where they partner with Cambridge Health Alliance and they provide health services here that are over and above what happens in a nurse's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5083.571s">And</a> so they had some particular information and insights about the kind of space that they would need to be able to hold such a facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5092.279s">Most</a> often those programs start out as grant funded by the Department of Public Health, which sounds amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5099.185s">And</a> so they just wanted to say like, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5101.227s">hey</a> like we just want to make sure you know that we're here and we're thinking about these things um so that's something that I told her like we needed to like connect back with the district administration and talk about that and figure out like if and how it should go on this form but you could you should maybe expect to see some change there on the form in the next <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5118.931s">week.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5119.231s">So</a> I had like a 30 minute conversation with them and my wheels were turning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5123.314s">And</a> I was like, this, this is the time to say we're envisioning something like that as a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5128.136s">We</a> certainly want to study how to have and provide that kind of space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5134.961s">Questions</a> about that, Luke?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5216.598s">Yeah,</a> no, I think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5218.86s">We</a> can add all of that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5222.002s">And</a> then <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5224.16s">If</a> any of you, the McGlynn Playground project is under construction right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5231.646s">And</a> it actually is an amazing use of outdoor space, and particularly for outdoor classrooms, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5237.07s">So</a> keep your eyes on that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5239.292s">It's</a> supposed to be done sometime this summer, hopefully before school starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5243.935s">But</a> it is really stunning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5246.057s">And</a> the outside space is very, very amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5252.967s">be</a> thinking about that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5254.369s">And</a> at one point, if I remember, we went after a big grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5261.519s">This</a> was years ago, because it was before Chad's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5266.625s">Suzanne</a> was at the Brooks, Joan you were here, and it was the entire grant was written to become a like very Fells-centric educational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5278.928s">Does</a> that ring a bell to you all? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5282.549s">It</a> was a high school grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5284.829s">I</a> don't know if it was through Bloomberg Foundations or it was some big, big, big grant where like it would have re-envisioned this building and it was architected by Heidi Riccio and <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5298.529s">I</a> forget, Edward, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5301.951s">Perella,</a> thank you, Mr. Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5304.732s">And</a> they submitted this very significant grant that had a lot to do with sort of being anchored to the fells as like a central like teaching point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5316.58s">Does</a> that ring any bells to anybody who's been around for a long time?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5333.297s">This</a> was just a grant application, like we didn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5339.7s">It</a> was a grant application and we didn't get the grants, but there was something submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5345.023s">So</a> I just I wonder if there is something in there if we can locate it that would be worth <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5356.018s">thinking</a> about in terms of inclusion from an outdoor space perspective, because if I remember correctly, the whole entire like genesis of the program they were proposing had to do with like being very anchored to the fact that the fell sat right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5373.726s">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5375.507s">Oh,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5397.074s">I</a> think it can't hurt for us to describe our intentions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5401.996s">Like</a> that we, you know, that we do have climate concerns on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5408.781s">on</a> this physical site, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5410.424s">Like</a> we have had issues because we sit right by the belt and every now and again the water pours in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5416.472s">But</a> I think to your point and to Luke's point, like we certainly need to make some space in this document to talk about the fields that are up high. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5426.004s">They</a> are at their end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5427.525s">They're</a> like more rubber than grass at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5432.049s">So</a> those fields need to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5434.45s">There</a> is a football practice field that's very much in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5439.234s">There's</a> another practice field up there that I'm sure somebody will tell me has a name and I don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5445.719s">But</a> there are all these other like little things all over the campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5451.543s">And</a> I think if like we were like dreaming really big, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5455.822s">you</a> wouldn't have to go across town to get to the football stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5459.983s">You</a> wouldn't have to go somewhere else to get to a softball field or a baseball field or a track, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5466.565s">So</a> maybe some sort of, maybe we can add something that talks about a more cohesive vision for our athletics properties as part of this project that service the students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5481.85s">Paul?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5649.558s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5650.658s">Emily?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5679.764s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5746.346s">So</a> I think I've heard like a million good ideas so far and I'm wondering if there are any volunteers who might take a shot at like a paragraph or some sort of narrative about any of the topics that we've talked about so far to sort of help <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5764.821s">make</a> light work of what is like otherwise a really heavy lift for the administration at this time of year when graduation is tomorrow and all the other things are happening before between now and the end of the year so is there I will see if I can't talk to some folks who might know where that grant application is and and you guys can go um in the can hop in Howard's Wayback Machine and um <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5793.021s">get</a> in the time machine and see what you can come up with from that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5796.543s">Because</a> I know that at the time, I was like, wow, this is so amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5800.766s">And</a> it was just really well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5802.927s">So</a> there just might be something there that helps draw that anchoring to the outside space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5809.412s">So</a> we'll take a look for that to see if there isn't something that we can pull in and integrate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5813.354s">Tracy?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5866.872s">Well,</a> I guess my thought is there's a way for us in this document to say like, <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5872.355s">We</a> are not tied to this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5874.477s">And</a> we have identified others that potentially are worthy of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5880.462s">But</a> as it relates to this location, here are some things that we would think are important if we are planning to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5889.129s">So</a> I think that's perfectly rational and reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5892.631s">So</a> if there is somebody who would like to take a crack at like the athletic spaces or the outdoor classroom spaces or the sort of anchoring to the fells, like if anyone wants to just take a shot at writing a paragraph or something and sending it to me, like I'm happy to do the integration if there are any volunteers.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6007.36s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6010.503s">Tracy,</a> the other thing that I'm thinking about is like the very active conversation about the arts that we are having in the community at this very moment and wondering if there isn't something that we should be adding about sort of like how we're envisioning like the artistic spaces and if you might think about writing something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6037.096s">Anybody</a> else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6055.929s">That</a> came up as well as having space for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6060.905s">Yeah,</a> it was like a really exciting conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6064.349s">I</a> was like, what about all the other schools?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6071.016s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6072.557s">So</a> Maria, I think the other space that like could require or like, do with a little bit of love would be the library space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6080.986s">Could</a> you take a crack at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6083.209s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6134.368s">The</a> other thing, Lori, that's gonna need to be sort of flushed in here is some conversation about the co-location of Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6142.194s">So</a> we might do with a paragraph from you about that vision, if you could work on that, Joan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6149.019s">Oh,</a> okay, great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6163.72s">Any</a> other questions about this section so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6166.882s">We've</a> got 10 minutes to go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6171.785s">That's</a> a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6172.766s">So</a> we're scheduled to meet next Wednesday, June 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6178.489s">Is</a> it Tuesday? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6179.13s">It's</a> a Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6180.451s">It's</a> a Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6181.331s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6182.492s">So</a> if you all could, by any means, get it to me by Friday, I can then do some integrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6190.717s">And</a> if you can't, it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6193.826s">give</a> it to me when you can.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6199.633s">Midnight</a> Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6202.016s">I'm</a> gonna I'll work on it over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6203.497s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6207.503s">Um,</a> item C is, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6210.507s">Still</a> a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6211.949s">Um,</a> the administrative team has some work to do to be able to describe that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6217.076s">Um,</a> so that there's nothing for you all to review there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6219.679s">Um,</a> and then section four is about community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6224.505s">Um,</a> and it talks about, um, some of the community engagement we have already done about Curtis Tufts and whether to co-locate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6233.227s">It</a> also talks about, um, some of the communications and community engagement subcommittee work, um, in terms of how we plan to engage the community in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6243.109s">And</a> it closes, um, by saying that certainly we will need a debt exclusion to fully fund this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6248.81s">Um,</a> but I think Maria had some questions about this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6252.071s">this</a> section for community engagement? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6256.272s">Oh,</a> Emily, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6257.533s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6611.792s">Yeah,</a> this is just a draft review.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6617.079s">Yes,</a> so everybody who has been found told to write something please go ahead and send that to me, I will do the integration of that information and then we will take another look at it next Wednesday and we'll decide are we like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6633.368s">feeling</a> good about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6634.249s">Do</a> we need more time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6635.211s">You</a> know, how do we, you know, how do we sort of balance, you know, speed and completeness? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6641.199s">Obviously,</a> that's always sort of the challenge, but we're on a good track and <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6649.375s">I</a> think all the feedback today was really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6651.657s">So</a> thank you all for, thank you for your feedback and your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6657.322s">Next</a> time we'll review this document and hopefully we'll take a first, maybe last look at the maintenance submission that has to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6665.649s">Again,</a> doesn't require this committee's review, but I think it's important that you all know what those questions and answers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6673.535s">We'll</a> see how far we can get in the drafting of those answers and then look at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6680.038s">The</a> other thing I wanted to do before everyone leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6683.96s">Sorry,</a> where's my schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6685.501s">We</a> have scheduled <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6696.81s">still,</a> we have a meeting on the 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6699.873s">And</a> then we had a subcommittee meeting that was a TBD on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6706.498s">We</a> then decided we would use that for the communications and community engagement subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6711.082s">However,</a> I have a date with my 11-year-old nephews to take them to see the Michael Jackson musical that evening, so I cannot attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6722.672s">Apparently</a> all fifth grade boys go through that phase and we are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6727.439s">So</a> I need to move that meeting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6730.903s">So</a> I will reach out to the communications subcommittee and we'll find another time where we can have another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6737.272s">There</a> are two meetings on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6741.48s">It</a> won in July, won in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6744.862s">We</a> may or may not need those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6746.904s">Maybe</a> we can use those as like a tour date to go see Arlington or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6753.928s">And</a> I think we, depending on how far we are able to get through the other documents, like we may do a Zoom only meeting at some point before the end of June to finish our deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6765.095s">The</a> last deliverable is actually not an action for this group to take, but it's a vote for the city council to take to authorize the funding for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6774.645s">The</a> mayor and I are working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6776.627s">MSBA</a> is reviewing the proposed language that will go up on the council agenda probably the week of the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6786.537s">but</a> we'll keep you all posted on when that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6788.538s">So</a> it's a really, the MSBA has to approve the language, the council has to vote it very specifically, but we're all on track for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6796.161s">So</a> the last piece of what we have to do in eligibility is information that we'll work with Director Hunt's office around community growth projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6808.346s">So</a> we are working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6809.887s">So</a> there's an enrollment piece on the school side and then there's a city piece <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6813.789s">that</a> has to get submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6814.97s">So</a> I am actively working with Director Hunt on that and hopefully we'll be able to get all that stuff like organized and put into the system in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6825.124s">So</a> we're on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6827.367s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6829.189s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6831.185s">That</a> is everything that I have for all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6833.026s">So</a> just a note to say like, bear with us as we get through the rest of the scheduling of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6837.868s">And</a> with that, I think we're at the end of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6843.29s">Our</a> next meeting is on June 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6846.851s">And</a> then my goal is to set the rest of the, my goal is to set our calendar for the fall once the school committee calendar is set, so we'll do that and then we'll set this calendar so you all can put it in your calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6858.544s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6860.086s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6861.187s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Luke, seconded by Tracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6865.832s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6866.593s">Roll</a> calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6867.973s">Jenny</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6868.573s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6868.914s">Mary</a> Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6869.874s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6870.735s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6871.775s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6872.155s">Dr.</a> Lucy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6873.056s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6873.316s">Dr.</a> Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6874.016s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6874.536s">Marta</a> Cabral.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6148.224s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6149.625s">I'm</a> actually going to hold most of my comments because Member Ruseau helpfully crafted a policy that covers much of what we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6161.454s">The</a> only other thing that I would add is that we will be making updates to the existing <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6169.597s">capital</a> plan for the schools in time for that next cycle next year, assuming that that passes tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6175.363s">So</a> we can get to that later, the process, which I think was the more substantive part of our conversation later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6183.932s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8021.01s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8022.875s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8024.175s">I</a> actually have had a chance to tour the playground, and it's super exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8029.176s">I</a> was involved in the CPC applications that started this, actually, that happened before I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8037.818s">And</a> it started out as a collaboration between the PTOs at the three schools that got resurfacing at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8046.02s">So</a> it was the Missittuc, the Brooks, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8048.824s">and</a> the McLean and the folks at the McLean. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8054.082s">were</a> very committed to making sure that what they did for that school served the school for the long haul and not in the just the immediate, like, I want the same as everybody else kind of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8067.191s">So</a> I want to just say thank you to them for their patience, because this has been a long process, much to all of our, you know, chagrin, like we all could have done without COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8078.339s">But</a> here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8080.802s">And</a> the project is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8082.483s">And</a> we're still accepting donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8084.684s">And</a> maybe we can put another reminder in the weekly in the weekly update from the superintendent that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8093.789s">So</a> we are still looking for community donations to support, you know, making sure that we can really sort of dress this proper place out the way that it deserves to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8105.682s">There's</a> so many trees going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8108.063s">It's</a> going to be the envy of every elementary school and the question is going to be which one is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8113.344s">So</a> I'm hopeful that we'll be able to find some money for those conversations quickly because this playground is far above anything that Medford Public Schools has ever been able to see or deliver to students before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8129.287s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8772.919s">Just</a> a few brief updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8775.88s">There</a> are five deliverables in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8778.48s">Two</a> of the five have been submitted to MSBA already. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8782.861s">The</a> remaining three are on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8786.402s">I</a> am anticipating that in our meeting tomorrow night the chapter 74 eligibility form will be finalized and approved by the committee and they will do a first draft review of our <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8798.445s">our</a> educational profile where we will look at that before June is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8802.889s">So</a> we are sort of pushing hard to make sure that we are getting all of our deliverables in just as quickly as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8811.235s">I'm</a> working with the mayor and the president of the council to make sure that the right votes get taken to fund the feasibility study, which will rely on free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8821.103s">So</a> all of that also just to happen here in the month of June in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8827.628s">In</a> terms of some of the work the committee has been doing, we have established two subcommittees so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8834.894s">One</a> is about communications and community engagement, actually three subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8839.277s">Communications</a> and community engagement has built a plan that includes some surveying that we'll do in the short term to ask the community sort of what their questions are so that the website can attempt to answer some of those questions proactively. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8854.982s">We</a> also have talked about a strategy of how to start to include the community in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8861.106s">It's</a> a little bit of a boring conversation right now because it's a lot of paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8865.648s">But</a> once we sort of move into the next phases, we're actually talking about things like feasibility study and envisioning what a new building could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8873.552s">That'll</a> be a sort of a completely different scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8877.294s">So</a> we have a plan that includes things like being at tables at community events and having a pitch deck for lack of a better term that we can use to go talk to all the boards and commissions who might be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8890.041s">So</a> we have some like upfront planning and survey work happening really over the course of the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8895.504s">And</a> then, you know, sort of really just using this time to set the stage for good proactive communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8903.735s">We</a> also had a rules and onboarding subcommittee meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8906.697s">We</a> have established and passed our operating rules, which are very similar to what they are here in terms of using Robert's Rules of Order and trying to take a more, actually a less formal tone than we do even here, but outlining the same rules of public participation that we use here so that we can make sure that our meetings can remain productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8930.591s">And,</a> you know, overall, have established a path for what happens when we need to onboard new people so we have sort of plans in place for all of that so that somebody coming on board can get up to speed quickly if that becomes necessary which over the life of us five to seven year project it's inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8951.618s">The</a> website, the dedicated website is just about complete in its draft form and it will include bios of all the folks that are on the committee, it will include all of our minutes and all of our agendas and all the documents that we have talked about so far, submitted documents, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8972.733s">And</a> then just other helpful links, FAQs, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8975.195s">So</a> all of that is about done and ready to be launched. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8978.9s">But</a> our anticipation is that there won't be a lot of traction for that until we get into the feasibility study phase, which is just a little ways down the road for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8991.63s">Again,</a> we have to be done by January 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8993.652s">We're</a> on track to be done far sooner than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8999.577s">And</a> the sooner that we're done, the sooner we can get in the queue to go to the board meeting, which happens every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9006.402s">And</a> then the sooner that we can move on to those next phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9011.104s">We</a> also had a finance subcommittee meeting, where we talked with Alicia hunt who's our director of planning and sustain a development and sustainability is that right okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9024.738s">And</a> she was immensely helpful there's been a lot of questions around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9029.705s">the</a> site of the new high school and whether there are other possibilities besides where Medford High is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9036.669s">And</a> she went through, she pulled up a map and went through what those options might be in terms of sort of things that she would be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9047.315s">We</a> don't need that information just yet, but at some point we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9050.437s">So,</a> you know, for example, like people have asked about Playstead Park as a potential site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9057.061s">I</a> think that has been noted before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9059.341s">She</a> actually said that's sort of not on her hit parade of places to look, namely because we would be burying the high school further into a corner of the city that is the wealthiest corner of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9074.832s">So</a> we'd be sort of advantaging students already who generally have lots of advantage in terms of getting to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9081.737s">And</a> then, you know, there's sort of a whole bunch of transportation concerns with that location as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9087.739s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, Moderator): She did cite Tufts Park is maybe someplace to think about because even though it is also sort of in a corner of the city, which is its own HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Challenge from a transportation perspective, her thought was like it is in a corner of the city that <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9102.349s">would</a> actually advantage students who are historically disadvantaged in terms of their ability to get back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9109.534s">She</a> also said that, you know, her planner heart says she would love to see Medford High back in the middle of the city, just like it used to be one day long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9117.999s">And</a> so that's sort of also a conversation we talked about, like the complex over at Hormel, and sort of ruled that out for the most part, because it would be too congested with <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9130.208s">elementary,</a> middle, and high school all sort of having to convene in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9134.491s">So</a> we had a really, really good discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9136.713s">We</a> also talked with Fiona Maxwell, who's our purchasing official for the city, and she's certified and meets requirements by MSBA, and she is starting to work on collecting <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9149.543s">model</a> documents for bringing on our owners project manager, which will be our next our next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9156.047s">And</a> we talked about, again, an aggressive goal that on the day where they approve us to go into the owners project manager selection phase that our fee goes out the door that same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9164.993s">And</a> so that's going to take some advanced work and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9168.335s">And</a> so she is starting to talk to the local communities around us who have done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9173.138s">to</a> start to pull some of those things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9174.839s">So</a> everybody's like really eager to get past this phase, which is exciting and has been helpful and collaborative all throughout the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9188.403s">So</a> it is a big committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9189.683s">Everything</a> is going great so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9191.464s">We've</a> had great attendance and great participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9193.624s">And</a> there's just like a lot of sort of legwork to do between now and say the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9199.666s">So</a> we'll continue to sort of work through that <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9201.887s">We</a> have a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9203.929s">Our</a> meetings are in the bistro so people are welcome to join us in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9207.592s">They</a> are on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9208.793s">We've</a> not seen a lot of traction yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9211.635s">It</a> is June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9214.497s">There</a> are a few million things happening at the same time so I'm not surprised but <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9218.974s">I</a> also think the time for that participation is going to be once we get into the feasibility study where we're hiring a designer who's actually engaging with us to say, tell us, tell us what you want this place to look like and what you want it to be and what you want to be able to do in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9234.212s">much</a> like what we talked about with McGlynn, like how do you really thoughtfully design like every last nook and cranny of a building so it both serves a need and provides some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9243.398s">So</a> all of that's like sort of down the line and that's where really we'll be talking to, you know, to teachers, to staff, to students, to the community and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9254.144s">So</a> all that's very much to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9256.526s">So</a> that's just a quick update of what we're doing, but we do have a pretty robust communication plan <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9263.806s">getting</a> underway, and everyone's excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9268.809s">I'm</a> happy to take any questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10314.285s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10315.606s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10318.267s">You</a> know, one of the things that I feel like we have seen, and we see it happen in different ways every year, but certainly we're seeing it this year, is like, you know, we get to the point where we're like talking about the budget with the community, and all of a sudden, what we're asking for and what we think we're going to get all gets like mushed together and people get really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10342.04s">What</a> when I think about being led by a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10345.682s">I</a> think that means like somebody sitting down at some point in time and saying, in order to make progress strategically on whatever our objectives are like here's what we need to do next year and then you have to sort of let reality like play play its course and and you adjust from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10363.072s">But</a> we've not yet ever really gotten to a point where like that, what do we need to do the things that we're setting out to do is not muddied by some financial reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10375.848s">And</a> I think it's a disservice to the community because I think people <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10380.593s">have</a> questions about, are we doing strategic thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10384.195s">Are</a> we doing things that, you know, improve the arts programming across the district from, you know, K to 12? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10391.859s">Like</a> nobody sees that work because it gets sort of buried under everything that happens when you start talking about the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10401.204s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10402.304s">Um,</a> I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10403.745s">We've,</a> we've sort of bifurcated these two things, but it's still very, it's so tight and close together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10409.269s">It's</a> still quite muddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10410.13s">Um,</a> and I would also say that we are unusual in that we are in June and still talking about a budget that does not happen across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10420.857s">People</a> are passing school committee budgets in January, and they're feeling like they're behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10425.68s">Like</a> there are communities that pass budgets before January. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10428.802s">Like</a> none of this is unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10432.102s">in</a> terms of sort of endeavoring to have a better process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10435.664s">And</a> I feel like maybe those communities have figured out that like the gauntlet of May and June is just not the time to be also hashing out like the, whether you're gonna have enough paper next year, like all of the things that sort of converge in May and June, like we need to start to offload some of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10454.231s">It's</a> just like an unsustainable amount of <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10458.971s">activity</a> that has to happen during that time, both for the superintendent, for all of Medford Public Schools, for this body, for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10466.532s">So</a> I think there's a way for us to sort of be thoughtful and strategic and do our part and do so in a little bit more of a pathway when we can take advantage of what are historically like generally sort of light meetings in January and February and March to really hash out <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10485.81s">the</a> strategic details and then we're sort of on our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10488.733s">So</a> I like the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10490.615s">I</a> have been pushing to do things sooner earlier since I started on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10497.482s">And</a> we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10498.683s">Like</a> and even here, here we are, it's June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10501.145s">And</a> I was like, it's earlier than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10503.428s">And</a> it's here, it's still June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10505.249s">We're</a> still talking about this in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10507.592s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10508.834s">people</a> don't have clarity about like what exactly is happening and what that means and to some degree that will always be the case because we are dependent on the mayor putting out her budget, she has work to do to do that that has nothing to do with us, and the council has to agree to all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10524.892s">There,</a> there are still those things that are going to push us to having budget discussions in June, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10530.894s">I</a> just think we should have less of budget discussions in June and more budget discussions earlier in the cycle so that we are not part of like what the ultimate <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10543.478s">sort</a> of June rush looks like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10545.84s">So</a> I think we have an opportunity to try this and if it doesn't work, we can revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10551.925s">So</a> I'm in full support and would make a motion to approve it with that one amendment of talking about the municipal allocation instead of the proposed reconciled budget in phase five, item 1B.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11134.966s">Okay,</a> Member Graham, and then we'll take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11138.047s">Sure,</a> I just wanted to revise my motion a little bit, and I think this might help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11142.529s">So</a> a motion to approve this on first reading with two amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11148.831s">One</a> is section five, item 1B, in that second line, it shouldn't say proposed reconciled budget, it should say proposed municipal allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11163.909s">And</a> then with a second amendment in phase two, item number two, it says principals and we're going to add and department heads discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.<h2><a href="../2024-05-30_bv-PbDpiP-8/2024-05-30_bv-PbDpiP-8.html">MHCSBC FInance Suboommittee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=14.327s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to go ahead and read the meeting notice so we can get started and. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=22.227s">Hopefully</a> it will not take us the entire time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=24.948s">So</a> we will see what we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=29.25s">Okay,</a> so please be advised that on Wednesday, May 29th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=36.053s">there'll</a> be a strategic and capital planning meeting, sorry, finance subcommittee meeting of the Medford High School Comprehensive School Building Committee held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=48.298s">The</a> meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=50.779s">The</a> meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel, through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast channel 9, 8, or 22, and Verizon channel 44, 45, or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=64.128s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can call or log in by using the following meeting number. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=69.012s">It's</a> 963-3633-4995. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=74.035s">Questions</a> or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing jennigraham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=80.319s">Those</a> submitting must include the following information, your first name and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=89.262s">So</a> I will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=92.223s">Let's</a> see, where did it go? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=94.403s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=101.906s">Member</a> Graham here, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, do not see her yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=107.387s">Libby</a> Brown? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=108.088s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=142.304s">Oh,</a> you're on mute, but I think you said yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=148.571s">Okay,</a> so for attendance purposes, we have three present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=155.938s">So</a> the meeting can be called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=159.822s">We</a> also thank you, Alicia, for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=164.792s">I</a> invited Alicia, who's our head of everything, it seems. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=171.555s">Development</a> and sustainability and something else, right, Alicia?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=180.64s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=181.16s">I</a> knew I was forgetting something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=183.341s">Because</a> a lot of the things that we'll be talking about certainly have some crossover into Alicia's world. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=190.559s">And</a> so thank you for being here and for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=195.201s">We</a> have just two items on our agenda for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=198.582s">And</a> certainly if people have questions along the way, it's a small group and you can feel free to stop me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=206.926s">And</a> I'm happy to field those questions as best I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=210.347s">We</a> have two agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=211.287s">So</a> one was, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=213.388s">to</a> start a discussion about potential sites for Medford High School that would inform our next steps in the process, which ultimately is getting towards a feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=225.499s">And</a> then the other thing that we have on our agenda is to discuss the anticipated budget for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=233.166s">And</a> if the mayor's not here, we may just table that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=236.428s">But</a> when we talk about potential sites, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=240.592s">there</a> I think there have been some questions raised in the community certainly over over the period of years around how to think about a new Medford High School and where it might be and I think you know certainly where it is right now is one very viable option but I think there is like a sort of a broader sense of possibility potentially in terms of what we might be thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=268.067s">And</a> we don't need to make any decisions tonight, but I wanted to start the conversation because if there is a broadening of what needs to be studied in the feasibility study, we'll need to know that in order to start to sort of weave that into our process and our application. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=283.239s">So</a> that's our first agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=288.063s">And</a> I am happy to <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=290.909s">take</a> any comments that you all have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=292.43s">So,</a> you know, Fiona and Bob, you may not have as much to say about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=297.692s">That's</a> totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=299.833s">But</a> just trying to start to think through, you know, as a group, where do we <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=306.752s">you</a> know, where do we begin in terms of sort of what is possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=314.275s">And</a> so, Alicia, thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=315.995s">That's</a> certainly a very helpful person to have on the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=320.797s">So</a> I will stop talking and see if there's any questions, comments, thoughts, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=326.099s">I</a> have a question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=364.093s">Yeah,</a> I think that is certainly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=366.416s">I</a> have, I have certainly heard people talk about Placedead Park as a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=371.641s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=374.144s">And</a> I guess if you're going to talk about Placedead you could talk about potentially any of those like sort of open green spaces which all are under city control. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=384.972s">Not</a> that I want to sort of be the committee that takes parks away, takes parks out of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=389.375s">I'm</a> not saying that, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=390.536s">It</a> will be a swamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=392.657s">But</a> that, you know, I know that that at least sounds like it has been a discussion over the course of years in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=402.664s">And</a> certainly, you know, as people speculate about what this project could be, that comes up fairly often. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=408.868s">And</a> I think it comes up often because at some point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=413.868s">There</a> was a discussion about if there was going to be a new high school, could it be somewhere else? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=417.414s">And</a> somehow that seems to have been the thing that sort of stuck in the. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=422.295s">public</a> purview.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=450.409s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=452.51s">I</a> do hear, I hear a lot of people talk about how it is not central in the city and it is not particularly easy to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=462.961s">I</a> can sort of speak to like our busing situation so currently we provide buses <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=472.952s">at</a> for those students who are more than two miles outside of the school zone in the secondary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=480.658s">So</a> that includes middle school and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=483.261s">The</a> way we do that at the high school is in part through MBTA buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=488.385s">And</a> then there is some yellow bus service to North Medford where there is no MBTA service. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=494.389s">So</a> certainly central location is something that's been discussed a whole bunch of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=501.895s">you</a> know, over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=503.076s">So</a> that certainly is a factor when we think about the high school and the, you know, the sheer amount of traffic that has to get to and from every day.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1456.806s">Yeah,</a> you would be talking about two building projects, not one at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1462.088s">Yeah,</a> that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1465.211s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1481.623s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1483.624s">Can</a> you share or do I need to let you share?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1488.508s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1488.728s">I'll</a> try that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1543.638s">Yeah,</a> I think there's a couple of variables there, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1546.98s">One</a> is that the school committee has voted that they want to see Curtis Tufts come onto the site of the high school in some sort of co-location perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1561.186s">So</a> that's one thing that, and obviously that's like 20 kids, so it's not like substantive in terms of the number of students, but the space needs are very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1571.411s">And</a> the other thing that is part of this grant is our early childhood programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1576.715s">So</a> there is a possibility of changing the amount of early childhood programming happening on the property in a way that would expand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1589.785s">So</a> the other thing that I think is like sort of dicey is like once you throw in the vocational programming, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1598.161s">The</a> space conversation is completely different than the space conversation about a new high school, but MSBA, you're correct, will go through and they will size the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1610.587s">They</a> will size the enrollment, and then I believe the feasibility study will size the building based on that enrollment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1670.734s">Yeah,</a> I think that's definitely something that we'll consider because edgily is, I mean, you can even see it in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1678.247s">You</a> can see more rubber in the picture than grass.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1686.37s">So</a> yeah, so we will, you know, have to contend with that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1689.013s">But</a> I, you know, I think some of that all of that can be studied, you know, anything about like the current, the current space can certainly be will certainly be part of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1698.082s">It's</a> really just a question of like, you know, where are those other possibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1702.467s">So</a> in doing this, are there any, you know,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1792.164s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1792.684s">Well,</a> and COLO, moving things around during <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1797.455s">construction</a> becomes really tricky with our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1801.116s">So</a> all of that will be part of the feasibility study as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1804.057s">But</a> just to say like, you know, it's not the same as like moving a classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1812.779s">It's</a> an entirely different sort of undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1815.26s">So</a> that's something that we'll have to consider as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1817.04s">So,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1820.241s">So</a> Alicia, are there any other spaces that <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1824.349s">come</a> to your mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1825.589s">I</a> think this is a perfectly fine working list, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1828.731s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1988.329s">But</a> that's State Road, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1990.25s">It</a> is a State Road.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2053.627s">Yeah,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2080.947s">Oh,</a> yeah, they pack them in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2085.066s">Alicia,</a> thank you for all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2086.407s">I</a> think this was really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2089.589s">I</a> have to, I just got access to the MSBA's portal that requires us to submit a bunch of information that feeds enrollment projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2100.757s">And</a> so, Bob and Alicia, there's definitely some tentacles there that will require your input around, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2109.301s">growth,</a> planned growth, and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2114.524s">So</a> I will sort of funnel that off to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2116.805s">I've</a> just started looking at it though. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2118.926s">I'm</a> not sure, I don't think there's anywhere where we have to sort of describe this just yet, but perhaps it has to be described in the RFP when we are at the point of like going out either to the OPM or out to, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2137.734s">the</a> actual feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2139.155s">So</a> hard to say like exactly when this information will be useful, but I think it's sort of on the minds of lots of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2144.86s">So</a> I'm glad that we had the conversation because now I can assure people that we are talking broadly about all the possibilities and really thinking through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2155.269s">Um,</a> I think that was, uh, that was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2157.971s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2158.791s">Um,</a> the other item on our agenda for tonight is to start to talk about, um, the anticipated budget for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2167.176s">So,</a> um, and, you know, I can talk a little bit about next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2170.819s">So</a> before, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2174.065s">before</a> we can get out of the eligibility phase, we have to, the city has to authorize a feasibility, the cost of a feasibility study and demonstrates MSBA that we have the money, whatever that mechanism is, and, you know, an amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2192.189s">So</a> that, I know I have been talking to the mayor about that and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2199.577s">I</a> believe her plan is to use free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2205.022s">At</a> least that's where she was at the last time I spoke with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2210.606s">And</a> so we won't need to take a vote to do a bond or a debt exclusion, but the council will have to take some sort of vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2219.286s">that</a> authorizes its use and it needs to be in a pile that is demonstrable for the MSBA in order for them to sort of flag us into the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2228.194s">So</a> procedurally, that's what needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2230.637s">As</a> I've been talking to people about sort of what the budget needs to be, I've heard <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2238.484s">you</a> know, a variety of numbers between two and a quarter and $3 million for the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2245.325s">Roughly</a> half of that, a little bit more than half, it sounds like, would come back to us eventually in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2252.327s">If</a> we get all the way through with MSBA, they do credit you back the same thing as your reimbursement rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2258.108s">And</a> when we had our kickoff call with them, I think they said our reimbursement rate was like 52.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2262.609s">seven</a> or 52.69 as of that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2265.812s">So</a> it changes, apparently it can change all the time, but 52% of that would come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2271.744s">eventually,</a> but not, but the city has to put the money up front to do the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2277.429s">The</a> other thing that was raised to my attention was that, and actually we took a tour of Arlington High School and they're in the middle of their project. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2287.819s">So</a> part of the building is open, part of it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2290.361s">And</a> they said something sort of related, which was, we're still learning how to use this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2296.987s">and</a> there's all kinds of things that happen in the building where they're like oh there's something wrong with the building and it just turns out like they don't know how to use the building like the entire infrastructure of the building is different than what they're used to and so they're very much in this like learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2312.591s">So</a> our CFO at the schools said that it's not uncommon for districts to <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2318.533s">In</a> addition to bringing on the OPM and ultimately the designer to bring somebody on on the district side to ride sort of side saddle with the project and really intimately understand all of the various components <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2337.451s">of</a> the build and how it works and how it's envisioned to work and how the plan changed to the actual and all of that from a facilities maintenance perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2347.56s">And</a> that that's a job that's sort of bigger than like the director of facilities just being able to do that in addition to all the other things that he does already. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2357.848s">And</a> that Jerry was saying that the other thing we might consider is, and I need to <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2363.733s">connect</a> back with him on this, but the other thing we might consider is making sure that that set aside funded this like this position that sort of helps us like sort of smooth that out and bridge the gap over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2378.118s">So</a> that's sort of another thing that we need to think about in terms of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2384.047s">So</a> I, you know, by all the accounts that I've heard somewhere between two and a half and three is probably the right amount of money based on all the things that have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2394.696s">But</a> Bob and Fiona, I wasn't sure whether you had resources that you could tap into in terms of other procurements. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2405.305s">and</a> the budgets being set for communities like ours for this for these processes that might help inform that that ultimate number that needs to be set aside and I don't know what sort of digging and investigating you all have done in your free time on this up till now and I don't know you know sort of how you are connected to other communities but I wanted to give you some space to <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2430.607s">talk</a> to us about what those, where you might have information that could plug into that, or even Alicia, if you have those connections, like how can we sort of leverage the city side and talk about all of that as well, sort of actively?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2552.949s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think that Nantucket is a very different place for all those reasons you cite. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2558.99s">I</a> don't know, Fiona, if you are connected to other purchasing folks that might have some light to shed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2566.071s">And</a> Libby, I know you sort of work in this space, if you have any light to shed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2571.012s">So</a> it's really just more to sort of get the juices flowing and thinking about before we go too far.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2638.25s">If</a> you could, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2639.77s">I</a> think the other thing that would be helpful Fiona to start the wheels turning in, um, in a related way is to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2646.88s">to</a> find out if they have copies of their procurements for their owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2652.503s">That's</a> going to be our net, you know, that's going to be our like big thing is to like get ready to issue that RFP because once the OPM gets on board, life for all the rest of us gets easier, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2664.03s">So</a> I'm looking forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2666.732s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2667.632s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2668.673s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2698.324s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2698.744s">And</a> Fiona, I'm thinking that there's also, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2702.483s">some</a> very school-specific things about building with MSBA that maybe your counterparts in those other communities could provide as well, because the MSBA's process is very prescriptive, sort of at every step. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2714.952s">So</a> anything that they can tell us, because my goal, you know, my goal, whenever we're done with eligibility and they invite us to the next phase, which is hiring our OPM, is like, my goal is that the next day our RP goes out the door and we are moving right along. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2732.205s">And</a> so obviously we'll sort of convene a working group with you between now and then to sort of get that procurement ready to go and make sure that it has all of its moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2742.93s">But</a> if you're talking to them anyway, maybe grabbing that stuff too from them would be really helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2881.572s">Right,</a> right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3031.681s">Yeah,</a> and the school committee has already outlined that set of goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3038.041s">we're</a> sort of on our way with that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3040.384s">But</a> yes, like making sure that sort of what we envision is well outlined is definitely sort of top of mind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3137.02s">Yeah,</a> and Alicia, the numbers I've been hearing are pretty consistent from multiple sources in terms of people familiar with Medford and this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3148.567s">The</a> numbers are not all over the map, so I think that's a good thing for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3154.11s">And</a> I think the mayor is hearing the same, so that is awesome.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3164.956s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3167.441s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3169.202s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3170.743s">And,</a> you know, ultimately, we will the city council have to take a vote with some very precise language, but I don't think that's anything for this group to be worried about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3179.387s">I</a> will like work with MSBA to make sure the language that goes forward is compliant and sort of ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3185.05s">But,</a> um. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3187.366s">Yeah,</a> I think those were our two agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3191.17s">So</a> thank you all for joining, 655. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3193.933s">We're</a> done early, so hopefully you can take your hour back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3200.099s">And</a> then Bob and Alicia, I will reach out to you separately about some of the things that we need from a planning and projection perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3211.437s">It</a> may be more Alicia than Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3212.798s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3213.299s">I've</a> just literally got the access like two hours ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3216.061s">So</a> we'll keep you posted.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3255.856s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3256.856s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3259.42s">So</a> if there are no other questions, is there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3270.183s">Motion</a> adjourned by Aaron, seconded by Libby. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3276.465s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3277.745s">And</a> roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3281.286s">Jenny</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3282.427s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn, absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3284.267s">Libby</a> Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3285.347s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3286.728s">And</a> Aaron Olapade.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3289.649s">Three</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3291.533s">The</a> meeting is adjourned.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=127.895s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=129.496s">Please</a> be advised that on Tuesday, May 21st at 4.30, there will be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=137.998s">This</a> meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=139.839s">You</a> can view the meeting live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel on Comcast 9, 8, or 22, or Verizon 43, 45, or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=154.232s">Since</a> this meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call by using the following call and number link. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=159.875s">The</a> meeting ID for Zoom is 970-762-6607. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=166.798s">Additionally,</a> questions and comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing jennigraham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=173.081s">Those</a> submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=180.953s">Our</a> agenda tonight is be it resolved that the strategic and capital planning committee will meet to review and update the district's capital needs assessment and planning document. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=189.858s">Be</a> it further resolved that the subcommittee will devise a process to ensure regular annual maintenance of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=194.881s">Be</a> it also resolved that the subcommittee will provide a report to the full school committee no later than June 10th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=200.305s">So</a> I'll call the roll, member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=206.008s">Member</a> Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=206.668s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=207.269s">And</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=208.269s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=208.729s">So</a> three presents are absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=211.85s">Here</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=212.231s">So</a> you can have that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=214.372s">So</a> I think actually what might make sense is for us to talk about the process first in terms of like how to ensure that we are doing that we are sort of getting back, I'll say getting back to post-COVID <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=232.832s">a</a> more routine and I'll say rigorous process around capital planning to try to anticipate, try to have like an ongoing roadmap that anticipates what those big needs are so that we can be communicating with our partners in city government what those upcoming needs are, what we think that they might be, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=253.921s">And</a> those things for which we would be wanting or needing capital funding to be able to complete the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=261.864s">So</a> before COVID, there was a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=267.986s">It</a> has changed over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=269.466s">So</a> there was a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=272.878s">back</a> right before COVID, I guess I would say maybe in the preceding year where like a sort of a four year chart that looks like this was produced. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=281.965s">And</a> it listed each of the buildings and what on a year by year basis was on the capital like roadmap for that building and sort of estimates of what was being accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=295.497s">And</a> then during COVID, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=299.399s">Our</a> process actually sort of got absorbed into the city of Medford's capital improvement plan, which is this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=309.161s">And</a> there's a number of things from a school perspective in this, in this document as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=316.343s">I'm</a> just trying to find the page that talks about some of those things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=324.865s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=330.63s">And</a> let's see, we have this report outlined 27 projects for the schools at a cost of 12.4% of the total costs outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=355.542s">total</a> anticipated cost of $60 million and a percentage of total costs being 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=363.023s">So,</a> and there's a whole lot of information about what those 27 projects are that were outlined at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=370.805s">And</a> I think the time is, I think the time is right for us as a school committee to sort of take back the ownership of tracking all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=380.727s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=382.403s">That</a> is true, especially because we now have a electronic ticketing system for all of our like maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=391.936s">projects</a> and requests across the district right so work orders can be put into like a formal tracking system that I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=399.659s">can</a> maybe help us sort of make light work of what these capital requests are so that we can then put them on the roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=407.209s">So,</a> Dr. Cushing, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about how that system is working versus like what we used to do, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=415.2s">ticketing</a> system of sorts, you know, but via email and much harder to sort of report and track. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=420.745s">So</a> what kind of capabilities do we have today?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=557.829s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=560.87s">Okay</a> so then would it make sense for us to identify the things that are on this plan that maybe still aren't done and need to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=568.695s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=570.232s">and</a> push them into the system, as well as to go, maybe ask you to go through the list of 27 projects in the city's capital plan and push those in so that we can generate a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=583.598s">And</a> then, you know, perhaps what we, so that's like startup, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=590.2s">So</a> we can get everything sort of pushed into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=593.462s">And</a> then I'm wondering if on an annual basis, we set some sort of like timeline or schedule around like, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=599.304s">when</a> will we have an annual capital planning discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=605.626s">So</a> that this committee sort of has that clear marching order, maybe we do it later in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=610.528s">So</a> it's not such a like, sort of working session, but more of a presentation of what those things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=617.49s">So</a> the community sort of can understand what those things, what those what those plans are and when. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=622.931s">And</a> I think my suggestion would be that that happen <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=628.755s">Not</a> in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=635.558s">But</a> I actually am almost wondering if we set this up to be like a November, December activity so that before the halfway point of the year and long before budget and long before free cash certifies, like we are proactively being able to like say and report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=657.829s">Um,</a> what, you know, what we believe that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=660.671s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=789.692s">I</a> think that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=792.693s">Buildings</a> and grounds has <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=795.054s">historically</a> like done many different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=799.296s">But</a> in its like last iterations, they were focused more on like, community driven, like beautification efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=811.402s">And</a> like, the more like, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=813.888s">tactical</a> day-to-day stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=816.169s">So,</a> and that may still be the right thing for them versus, I'm almost thinking like this committee will get together to sort of craft what ultimately according to our policy really should be happening at a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=830.374s">So</a> if we think about like doing our work in October to collect, to make sure that like we have, you know, we have a report out of the ticketing system, we can sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=842.244s">I</a> think it would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=843.425s">If</a> we could craft what we think is like the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=846.207s">Prioritization</a> and then bring it to a committee, the whole, to present that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=851.192s">To</a> the entire committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=852.172s">So</a> we have the entire committee's involvement in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=854.114s">That</a> might make some sense in terms of like a flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=857.757s">And</a> then certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=860.119s">Because</a> the whole committee's there,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1090.223s">So</a> two things sort of come to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1092.984s">I</a> had a conversation with Alicia Hunt last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1097.319s">And</a> we were talking about this process of recommissioning buildings, which essentially looks at everything and says, here's how you restore this building to its original purpose and function. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1112.845s">And</a> this is what you have to do in order to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1115.346s">And</a> eventually, the idea is we should do that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1121.088s">one</a> building at a time in rotation over a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1124.631s">And</a> then no building is ever more than like six or seven years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1128.773s">And</a> that's enough to like have that sort of big picture point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1135.718s">The</a> city has indicated a willingness to do that across this, for all of our outbuildings, not this building, not Curtis Tufts, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1147.086s">Alicia</a> would, her opinion is that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1151.092s">the</a> OPM that they're bringing on to do the Andrews McGlynn project, they are the right people to help us do this too because of their deep familiarity with the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1163.52s">And</a> so she was definitely like sort of favorable to working with them to help facilitate that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1170.424s">But</a> to her point, like when you recommission a building, what you get out of it is a list of like problems to fix.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1180.81s">It's</a> the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1181.71s">It's</a> the beginning of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1183.812s">It's</a> basically the creation of your to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1186.013s">But</a> all of those things should feed either work orders for the maintenance team to do because they have capacity to do X or Y or Z, or something that has to go on the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1199.321s">So</a> really, the output of the recommissioning study should go into the ticketing system so that we have one place <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1206.445s">for</a> all of this to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1208.206s">So</a> I think Alicia can be a real ally in that and she's indicated a willingness to attend meetings provided that we can like say hey this is the meeting I want you to attend because she's got a lot on her plate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1236.385s">something</a> different.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1281.156s">Is</a> that HMFA? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1281.997s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1282.077s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1282.297s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1285.68s">And</a> so they're sort of another potential that could be part, you know, be part of the conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1307.029s">No,</a> probably not, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1309.11s">And</a> it could be that BTQ, I think that's their name, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1314.793s">Does</a> the OPM work?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1318.376s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1318.836s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1320.178s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1322.099s">I</a> thought she was talking about B2Q to actually execute the recommissioning study. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1327.844s">But</a> anyway, we can find that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1329.225s">I'm</a> not overly concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1331.227s">The</a> other question I had is, timing-wise, if we were to say our process is from October 1st to October 15th, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1340.575s">We're</a> going to push out a proactive email to the principals of the buildings to say, if there is something that belongs on our capital plan like speak now submit your tickets, so that we can we can catch all of those and categorize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1354.233s">And</a> then between, you know, late October early know, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1358.755s">Late</a> October into November, maybe we'll give ourselves the month of November because it's November and you know, it's a short month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1365.921s">We</a> sort of meet and put together sort of a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1369.845s">And</a> then in December, one of our meetings becomes or part, you know, part of one of our meetings becomes a committee of the whole where we review that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1377.091s">That</a> timing all works in the lead up to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1381.82s">free</a> cash being available if we are dependent on free cash for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1386.443s">It</a> also predates or precedes our budget cycle.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1394.327s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1395.868s">And</a> presumably if there's a stabilization fund, you could like tap into that at any time, but also it's not like an endless pot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1402.952s">So</a> that prioritization is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1406.173s">The</a> one question I have is where does the CPC <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1411.91s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1413.591s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1415.613s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1417.354s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1418.415s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1419.756s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1420.577s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1421.838s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1422.698s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1423.699s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1424.52s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1425.601s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1431.784s">I,</a> I don't exactly know like when are their applications do I would just want us to a rolling to like I did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1438.066s">I</a> think there are certain things that are rolling, but I, but I thought there were like rounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1442.867s">So</a> I would just want to make sure like wherever that fits like It all fits into this process because I would hate for us to be like, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1449.97s">And</a> we could get CPC funding and like, oh, we just missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1452.951s">You</a> know, I don't want us to like set Oh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1455.211s">Why</a> a
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1696.851s">So</a> I have found two other presentations beyond the 27 projects that are listed here, so in the city's plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1708.983s">And</a> so I just wanted to run through because they're old, but I don't think that necessarily means they're not <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1715.567s">that</a> they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1716.827s">So</a> this list has, it's mostly lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1720.889s">So</a> Peter, I think that's a question in terms of cafeteria and exterior lighting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1781.314s">Okay,</a> so I just want to finish going through this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1783.195s">So</a> the Roberts School exterior lighting, are there exterior lighting needs that have not been addressed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1790.36s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1791.12s">And</a> then Missittuck has not yet been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1793.602s">Brooks</a> has not yet been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1795.783s">Curtis</a> Tufts.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1856.557s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1856.977s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1857.097s">So</a> you can check on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1859.258s">Also</a> on the Andrews School, and this list, by the way, this list is from like 2017, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1862.54s">So</a> I just want to make sure there's stuff that's still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1865.941s">We're</a> taking it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1868.082s">Andrews</a> School, it says controls upgrade for ADR. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1871.483s">And</a> I don't even actually know what that means.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1898.861s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1903.164s">Oh,</a> that's not us, that's public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1905.285s">Okay,</a> Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1908.07s">You'll</a> find it funny to know that they said the Andrews HVAC upgrades were going to cost $25,000.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1963.095s">OK,</a> so then the second plan, just to bring us to current.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1969.398s">Yes,</a> draft number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1972.3s">Two</a> air compressors at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1975.27s">five</a> air compressors at Missittuck, two air compressors at Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1979.174s">They</a> all were replaced, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1990.744s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1992.846s">Andrew's</a> new roof, that actually got done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2028.357s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2030.138s">McGlynn</a> Complex had auditorium seating work for $25,000.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2055.431s">And</a> then at the high school replace or replace repair fire alarm sealing system in 2019.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2079.392s">OK,</a> so and then we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2083.814s">I'm</a> going to put security improvements to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2085.874s">I</a> know that's an ongoing conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2087.415s">The</a> Andrews outside curb repairs, those curbs are still not installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2092.456s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2099.977s">And</a> then there is an item here for the McGlynn complex, asphalt and tire complex, including Andrews side curb repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2109.697s">Um,</a> so all of that is still like in progress, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2112.779s">That's</a> not complete.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2145.364s">Okay,</a> so I'm not going to worry about some of the later things for high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2152.348s">McGlynn</a> complex, roof rebuild, air compressors, and chiller contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2158.544s">contact</a> compressor, all of that is being handled with this HVAC project that will go in for the system to be tracked.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2185.852s">So</a> we would have some sort of roof assessment, which I think we can sort of let recommissioning guide priority there, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2199.942s">The</a> other thing that's on here looks like water heaters at the Andrews.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2323.581s">So</a> we said CPC applications are like July? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2327.022s">Opens</a> in July, due in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2328.563s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2343.907s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2344.347s">I</a> think they were the $120,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2345.688s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2348.228s">Yeah,</a> I think they were the $120,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2349.389s">They</a> were huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2350.449s">Yeah,</a> they were not inexpensive.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2353.638s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2355.019s">And</a> that was, you know, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2356.459s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2357.18s">So</a> then I think it was, sorry, the surfacing at Roberts was 109, 540.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2374.987s">Um,</a> okay, so I think from a sort of process and cadence perspective and Jerry like, please weigh in what we talked about was like. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2385.929s">a</a> desire to use the ticketing system, sort of push all of the things into it so that it can come, it can be tracked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2393.094s">And</a> then at the beginning of October, we would send out a reminder to principals that like, we're gonna do our, we're gonna start our capital planning process for the annual year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2403.94s">And</a> so if they have anything else, they need to like get those things into the system so we can be considering them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2409.544s">And</a> then in October and November, this committee will meet to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2413.948s">lisa</a> smith, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2437.759s">I</a> think we should invite Alicia to our like our subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2456.255s">especially</a> because I think that is more likely to be happening in her work day, which might be easier for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2463.098s">And</a> then certainly she wants to come to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2465.379s">So</a> that's sort of what we're talking about in terms of sort of revising our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2470.141s">Does</a> that make sense to you?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2486.689s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2498.515s">And</a> I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2500.156s">So</a> I think the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2502.444s">is</a> that we probably can present the process to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2509.349s">I'm</a> happy to write it up after we meet so that everybody knows what to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2514.892s">That</a> is actually something that we do need to do in one of our upcoming meetings in June, because that's what we said we would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2521.797s">And</a> I think, Peter, I can pass these old items to you to put into operations hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2531.738s">And</a> then maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2534.301s">Maybe</a> we even like you tell us when you're ready to meet with like sort of everything that you can see pushed in and we can look at what that reporting looks like and tweak it even in advance of this next official cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2548.553s">So</a> I would be happy to like do that on Zoom over the summer at some point if there's a time that works for everybody, just so that it happens when things are not quite as chaotic as the beginning of the school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2564.092s">Do</a> you need that investigated before? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2566.413s">I</a> don't think we need to investigate it before we tell the committee what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2571.435s">But</a> I think before we meet in the summer, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2575.977s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2576.937s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2604.229s">I</a> don't think we necessarily need to, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2608.351s">If</a> you're willing to take a crack at writing the policy on our behalf.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2923.88s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2926.881s">So</a> it sounds like maybe we just need to make a motion to present our policy and process to the school committee and that member Rousseau is going to draft on our behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2939.568s">I'll</a> make that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2941.349s">Motion</a> by Member White. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2943.271s">I'll</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2944.071s">Seconded</a> by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2946.933s">Oh,</a> we're in person.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2949.795s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2950.515s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2951.076s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2951.556s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2952.337s">All</a> those opposed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2954.318s">Only</a> three of us, so we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2955.739s">Motion</a> passes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3058.974s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3059.635s">I</a> did see that she did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3061.496s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3062.176s">But,</a> um, yeah, and I actually got to join the playground last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3066.318s">Um,</a> and it was awesome.<h2><a href="../2024-05-20_3RWkmZ9GDFQ/2024-05-20_3RWkmZ9GDFQ.html">5.20.2024 Regular /Budget Vote School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=579.402s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=823.295s">Can</a> I motion to waive the second reading?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=841.738s">Oh,</a> okay, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=842.859s">Withdrawn.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1952.752s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you Adam and Savannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1956.471s">Savannah</a> and I live in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1958.053s">So</a> and I happen to be home when when attacked place and I happen to be driving by as the police were responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1966.02s">So</a> it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1969.363s">But</a> I sure I'm glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood because that would have been terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1975.429s">But</a> thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1977.831s">It's</a> really important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1979.213s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.1s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.56s">I</a> just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3855.362s">This</a> actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3875.15s">Cabral</a> brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3876.994s">and</a> I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3883.341s">So</a> can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3974.402s">And</a> so do you think that you can start this program next year and <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3982.685s">Is</a> that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4034.479s">I</a> just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4039.11s">project</a> and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4045.552s">And</a> I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4058.476s">that's</a> since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4063.479s">So</a> I'm so happy that it's finally here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4065.74s">And</a> it's only been four and a half years, and it's not been a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4069.042s">But</a> I do want to sort of like we're all here, but this room is full, because we're having a budget presentation soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4075.285s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that Miss Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4094.45s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4099.36s">Thank</a> you, that's it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4555.984s">Can</a> I just interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4558.727s">Just</a> so that the committee knows why these folks are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4562.631s">As</a> we have been planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4565.915s">For</a> the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is fill out some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want them to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4582.894s">And</a> the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need programming space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4597.338s">And</a> MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4603.76s">So</a> Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4608.941s">My</a> hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to direct them to continue to explore these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4617.587s">because</a> that will be needed to send to the MSBA with our chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4633.251s">So</a> I will turn it over to Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4635.871s">I</a> just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5166.92s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5168.202s">Um,</a> in terms of the expansion of auto tech cosmetology, electrical and health assisting, can those expansions happen in the current space? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5178.856s">Or</a> are you space constrained?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5201.75s">None</a> of those are currently budgeted for FY25, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5220.223s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5221.785s">In</a> terms of the expansion of those programs, I would love to see a report at some point early next year about sort of a proposal from you all to implement those expansions like over the course of the next <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5238.129s">number</a> of years where space is not a constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5240.631s">So</a> obviously electrical would be a sort of a separate issue, but for the three shops where we could expand, what would you recommend that timeline be? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5248.958s">And</a> do they all go at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5250.559s">Does</a> one come first or second? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5252.701s">But</a> I would like to see that, you know, it does not have to be now, it does not have to be before the end of the year, but as we think about like next fall, really having you come to us with a sort of a proposal of like what we should be planning for and expecting in the coming years, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5267.625s">very</a> much so, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5268.566s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5269.787s">And</a> then I'm gonna make a motion that the school committee request that the MSBA explore the program expansions and new programs outlined in this presentation as part of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5284.82s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5285.14s">Did</a> you get all of that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5304.501s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5306.342s">Actually,</a> can we roll call? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5307.723s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5318.189s">Sorry,</a> school building committee to feed the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5321.84s">application.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5322.541s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5328.367s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5919.698s">So</a> just so that everyone knows, thank you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5922.421s">I</a> know it's very hot in here and that's not on purpose, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5927.465s">But</a> I'm afraid to consider opening the windows because I don't think that'll work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5931.047s">So</a> hopefully we can just bear with the heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5935.631s">Item</a> number six is a budget update from Mr. Gerry McCue, our Director of Finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5940.175s">He's</a> gonna provide his presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5942.116s">I'm</a> gonna let the committee ask some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5946.099s">And</a> get their questions answered and then we will be happy to take public comment from all of you I assume many of you are here to speak, just to set your expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5955.531s">We</a> do ask that folks speaking at public comment limit their comments to three minutes and one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5962.959s">So</a> please bear with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5966.773s">Please</a> feel free to speak from the heart or whatever it is that you need to speak from, but also just remember to do it briefly so that we can all have a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5978.242s">So,</a> Mr. McHugh, it's all yours.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6818.766s">questions</a> from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6819.667s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7000.489s">Thank</a> you, Mr. so before we continue talking about Mr. so his motion is on the floor if there is a second it can stay on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7011.537s">Second,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7013.419s">But</a> we're not going to take a vote on that until we have heard the questions of the rest of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7017.622s">And</a> we have heard from all of you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7022.185s">Everyone</a> can just take a breath, exhale, we're going to get to all of you before we get to any sort of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7028.533s">Mr.</a> so can you please sort of explain those numbers one more time just so that everybody understands what you just said.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7084.933s">So</a> before we take any vote, we'll make sure that we can look at that spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7088.156s">So</a> take your time, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7090.798s">Are</a> there questions from the rest of the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7094.093s">Member</a> Bradley.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7250.23s">Member</a> Branley, do you want the exact numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7252.131s">I</a> have the proposal from last week in front of me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7363.115s">Member</a> Branley, would you like the superintendent to weigh in here?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7366.918s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7368.379s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8089.983s">Adjustment</a> Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8091.525s">I</a> think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8092.525s">Bowen</a> is saying no, you do not need to have an IEP.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8103.675s">So</a> the answer, just so that people that are on the phone can understand the questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8109.119s">The</a> question was, do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment Councilor or school psychologist? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8113.763s">And</a> the answer to both is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8115.385s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8508.604s">And</a> if I can interrupt from the chair, for those of you who may be joining us for the first time, lucky you, because we do this every year and it is five years and counting of being pretty bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8522.289s">So</a> what we have tried to do in the last couple of years is do two things when we are talking about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8532.072s">The</a> first is to request <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8535.293s">what</a> we need from the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8538.196s">So</a> that is the motion that Member Ruseau put on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8543.26s">Then</a> we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8545.612s">wait</a> patiently or impatiently, as it may be for the mayor to finish her work citywide, and for the council to pass their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8554.415s">And</a> once those two things happen, the preliminary number that was provided by the mayor under the budget ordinance by the city council was preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8563.718s">That</a> means it's not final. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8566.019s">So</a> we will get a number through a past budget via the mayor and the city council at some point between now and the end of June, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8575.859s">And</a> at that time, we typically will pass a second request or a second motion that actually spends the money appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8585.824s">So</a> what Mr. Russo put on the floor tonight, just for you all to be clear, is our request to the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8594.208s">I</a> don't think it outlines any cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8596.049s">You</a> said level service, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8619.952s">And</a> you can see that on the screen now so that request will go to the mayor, obviously she's here tonight but that will go to the mayor, it will go to the finance team at the city, it'll be considered by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8637.165s">to</a> the city council, they then we all have to let them do their work and wait patiently or impatiently depending on who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8646.071s">And</a> when they finish their work, they'll come back around to us and say here's your number, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8653.135s">We</a> will be back here if the number is not what we requested it never is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8659.441s">And</a> we will talk about like the brass tacks of exactly what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8663.805s">So</a> that's the process I just want to make sure everybody knows what that is, where we are right now is we're making a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8671.131s">What</a> Jerry has laid out is sort of something in the middle of like what we might request and what is responsive to that preliminary number. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8679.813s">So</a> I just wanna make sure everybody is clear on that before we take public comment, but there are no other comments from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8688.014s">Member</a> Ruseau, did you have another comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8691.015s">Oh,</a> I did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8691.615s">I</a> just turned my mic off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8695.015s">Member</a> Intoppa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9170.226s">I</a> think we have a question from our student reps too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9172.307s">So</a> Jerry, do you have an answer?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9258.018s">Okay,</a> I can take a shot at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9259.279s">How's</a> that sound? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9260.339s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9262.28s">So,</a> so, in order to put forward a proposition two and a half override to the city, the mayor and the council need to agree to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9271.364s">I</a> sit on the city's finance task force and I know that that is very much part of the discussion happening right now so I believe that we will see a request from both the council and the <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9282.029s">to</a> do a proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9284.831s">There</a> is, there are still a lot of questions to be sort of asked and answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9289.634s">We've</a> never even tried this in Medford before in history, we are one of like three communities in the entire state that hasn't even tried so we have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9299.341s">We're</a> trying to collect answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9301.082s">And</a> those answers might include or could include if we do a proposition two and a half override, and it passes how quickly can that money flow to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9311.307s">That</a> is going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9312.347s">And</a> that's why I say we have to let the mayor and the council do their work, because they have a lot of questions to ask and answer to figure out like what is that path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9322.952s">There's</a> all kinds of other stuff that goes on in budgeting that the mayor is still working on as she puts her budget out so <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9328.955s">She</a> may find that, you know, for example, local receipts from local receipts were higher than expected and so the revenue forecast can change so there's a lot of variables still happening but I think to answer your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9341.605s">Yes,</a> a proposition to have override is very much on the table and that would allow us and the first time in history to ask the community to tell us how much they value our schools and. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9354.465s">I've</a> said it a million times I've campaigned three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9357.147s">I'm</a> a supporter, I will knock on your door and I will convince you when we get there but yeah it's a good question and I think that's where what we're going to do tonight is we're going to make a request so that everybody in the city knows what we need to help Medford thrive, not survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9374.295s">What</a> Jerry has presented is like that sort of middle of the road response that includes both like what do we want to thrive, and then what do we think we might actually have at our disposal and how do we sort of close that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9389.867s">If</a> that number that comes back from the city is something less than what we have asked for, then this committee will have to make the choices about what is funded and what is not so, but to answer your question, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9403.452s">Raising</a> revenue is one way that you balance the scales. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9408.534s">So,</a> you're right on target. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9411.116s">It's</a> just not something this group has the authority to do or I would do it tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9573.72s">Jerry,</a> can I just also say from the chair that when you look at the depreciation life cycle of laptops that are frankly like more powerful and sophisticated than a Chromebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9585.105s">The</a> typical depreciation life cycle is like two or three years in any corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9590.187s">So</a> when we talk about a five year life cycle we're actually talking about a pretty extended life cycle for our equipment for our students so <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9598.01s">Luckily,</a> Chromebooks have fewer moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9600.052s">And</a> so that's a little bit more feasible than in a laptop situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9604.575s">But</a> this depreciation cycle is very long already in today's time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9753.584s">Darren</a> did you have more questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10034.29s">You</a> can describe it right now if you want.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10041.692s">Can</a> you put your microphone on so we can hear you?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10338.096s">Darren,</a> did you want to tell us about your petition?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10608.288s">Thank</a> you, Darren. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10608.889s">Thank</a> you, Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10609.549s">There's</a> many, many pages of signatures here, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10613.113s">And</a> I think, you know, sorry, I'm gonna maybe step away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10618.459s">Oh,</a> is it, can you turn your mic off? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10620.801s">I</a> don't think that's causing the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10623.666s">Okay,</a> I think that's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10625.167s">I'll</a> stand back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10629.008s">I</a> know that this has been particularly hard on students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10632.41s">Thank</a> you all for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10634.231s">I</a> long for a day where our students can just be kids, and they don't have to worry about budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10641.835s">And</a> we're not there yet, obviously, judging by how many students are in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10647.581s">But</a> you're, you've all been heard, you've all been heard by all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10651.866s">I</a> don't think there's a single person in this room that wants to make the kinds of cuts that we are talking about having to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10658.193s">And</a> we will get to a vote that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10661.056s">sort</a> of solidifies that in just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10663.177s">But</a> before we do that, I do want to hear from the community if there are folks who would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10670.321s">So</a> as a reminder, three minutes, please be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10674.002s">And</a> if you come to, oh, sorry, member of the potty, go ahead.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11046.636s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11364.465s">But</a> I think the point is they're still employed at Medford Public Schools through the end of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11368.606s">So</a> that work would have to happen in the right now in order to be ready for next year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12363.624s">I'm</a> going to ask the superintendent to answer your question once we get through some of this public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12368.826s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12389.255s">I</a> mean, most people aren't giving it anyway, or it can't be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12392.137s">So</a> I think we're okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12393.178s">If</a> you just want to tell us your name, that's fine.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12502.781s">Is</a> there somebody else who would like to speak.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15543.953s">I</a> just want to remind you that you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15549.174s">Okay,</a> that's still a lot of people that need to speak and I just want to be respectful of everyone's time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=17910.44s">Watch,</a> but I just wanted to remind you that you have three minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18509.695s">Could</a> you please put the spreadsheet back up on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18514.139s">And</a> so could you please repeat your motion.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=16.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=18.777s">So</a> please be advised there will be a meeting of the Medford Comprehensive High School Elite Committee held at Leisure 489, Medford Occasional Technical High School, 489 Windsor Street and via remote participation for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=33.5s">Meetings</a> can be viewed live on the Medford Public Schools YouTube channel, preventative community media, and your local cable channel, podcast channel, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=41.685s">98422</a> Horizon Channel 4345447. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=44.347s">The</a> meeting will be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=48.829s">Please</a> log in by using the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=51.47s">The</a> due meeting ID is 963-2041-9196. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=53.932s">Just</a> like editorial comment, you have to sort of read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=62.596s">You</a> need a description for everybody to know what meeting is that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=68.079s">You</a> all know why you're here, but some days you might watch this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=71.425s">want</a> to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=73.626s">Okay,</a> so I'm going to do a quick roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=75.247s">Mayor</a> Mungo-Kern.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=162.422s">Marissa,</a> if you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=167.265s">You</a> can all see your squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=168.786s">So</a> that might just help us know that you want to get a wordage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=175.831s">The</a> next thing on the agenda is what we call a consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=179.273s">And</a> it's essentially a place where you put items that have to be officially approved by the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=185.261s">but</a> for which like there's probably no conversation really to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=189.702s">So</a> the three items that are in there that we need to approve tonight are our meeting minutes from our personal meeting, from our relief and onboarding subcommittee meeting, from our communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=202.686s">If</a> you take a look at the meeting minutes, you will see that they are very late. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=207.247s">That</a> is because those meetings by and large did not have a lot of action in terms of motion <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=214.147s">and</a> votes and things to approve or deny. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=218.351s">We</a> also, in the electronic version of this, you can click a link to the YouTube channel and see the actual reported meeting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=227.939s">We</a> try to err on the side of slimmer minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=232.382s">These</a> are still totally permissible under the OPA law, but the more detailed they are, the more like you have to read and recount and say what's accurate, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=240.725s">that</a> I've saved them that quite way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=242.405s">And</a> you just find that that sort of leads to just a lot of work that I can try to avoid if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=253.128s">So</a> the consent agenda is basically approving the meeting minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=258.169s">And</a> the meeting minutes also include several documents that we'll actually talk about in some detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=263.33s">But</a> the first thing
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=278.761s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=285.408s">If</a> there was something that you were like, I want to talk about this thing separately, you just <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=290.353s">just</a> let me know, and we will sever that, we'll pull it out, we'll vote everything else through, and then pass the conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=299.777s">And</a> in general, we're gonna try to drop the Robertson's border without boring you all with lots of financial about Robertson's border, so the general thing is if you have a question and you don't know how to do it, just ask, and the people that take questions know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=317.647s">And</a> the other thing that's worth noting about the law is that if there are people, it is a hybrid meeting in terms of participants, we do a roll call.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=373.039s">Okay,</a> 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the minutes are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=379.648s">For</a> three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=381.643s">One</a> of the things that we charge the rules and onboarding team to do is provide a set of operating rules for this committee and give some thought to onboarding both for all of you, as well as for people who may join this committee over time, because that's sort of inevitable when you talk about a seven, six, seven year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=405.362s">So</a> if you flip through your packet, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=409.545s">What</a> I wanted to do is just go through these rules and ask you all like what questions you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=417.429s">If</a> you think anything's missing, this is a place where we can certainly amend these rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=421.332s">And</a> then when we're done reviewing the rules, we will take a vote to adopt them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=427.615s">So</a> the rules committee met <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=432.212s">for</a> about an hour, so they were incredibly efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=434.635s">We</a> did a fast job of trying to create a set of rules and an onboarding checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=440.46s">So</a> we'll start with the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=443.122s">The</a> first thing that we have in here is essentially that we will simply use SBC as the acronym for this, because if you add all of the Medford Comprehensive <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=455.834s">high</a> school building committee it's a lot of letters so we will adopt SPC as our sort of common acronym. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=463.797s">item</a> number two we had some discussion about so if you watch council meetings or school committee meetings everyone is member so-and-so Councilor so-and-so we sort of landed on a slightly different approach we are residents and neighbors and as such we will refer to each other by our first name unless somebody requests otherwise the mayor of medford will be referred to as mayor and the superintendent will be referred to as superintendent but otherwise we're going to be friends and neighbors first and committee members second so <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=493.273s">That's</a> item number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=496.152s">Members</a> of the SBC are urged to speak for themselves using I statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=500.713s">Allow</a> for one speaker at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=502.673s">Be</a> present, engaged, and prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=505.174s">Engage</a> in honest and open conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=507.894s">Assume</a> the best intentions and understand and acknowledge intent and hold themselves and one another accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=514.575s">Item</a> number four, public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=520.436s">The</a> chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=524.858s">The</a> chair will announce the timeline before any public comment period at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=530.205s">The</a> public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing by emailing the SBC account. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=534.451s">Those</a> emails will be auto forwarded to all members when they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=539.626s">Item</a> number five, the SBC will operate following Robert's Rules of Order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=544.228s">And</a> what we try to do here is give you like the ones you need to know in order to sort of function in a basic way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=550.53s">So</a> voting happens when a motion to do something is made and seconded after debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=556.192s">Under</a> the open meeting law, voice votes are allowed when everybody is physically present. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=560.394s">So</a> that's where we say all those in favor, all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=563.915s">and</a> you just say aye or nay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=566.456s">However,</a> when any voting member is remotely participating, a roll call is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=570.838s">Any</a> voting member may request a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=573.099s">So</a> if we were all here in person and there was something sort of squirrelly going on and you were like, no, I really want to know where everybody stands, you just say roll call and then we will do an official roll call so everyone has to register their vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=585.084s">Um,</a> any voting member may suggest an amendment to the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=588.648s">The</a> chair will guide and support members in following Robert's rules during the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=592.352s">Members</a> may speak twice on any debatable motion for up to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=596.396s">And</a> once voting begins, no member may speak other than to indicate how they are voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=603.368s">If</a> a voting member of the committee believes a mistake was made with a motion that passed or failed and that member was in the majority for that motion, they may make a motion to reconsider to do so by speaking to the chair on how to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=616.453s">So</a> in other words, if something happens really fast and <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=620.994s">you</a> know, it was sort of a split vote, and somebody that was on the winning side says, wait a minute, I don't think we all know what we just did there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=628.782s">Like,</a> there's a process for us to reconsider, as long as that is raised by somebody who was in the majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=637.57s">And</a> if that happens, just say, wait a minute, I have a question, and we'll like work through the mechanics of how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=644.436s">And</a> then if items on the agenda will be taken out of order from how they are presented on the agenda, a voting member must make a motion to suspend the rules and take them specifically out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=655.286s">Item</a> number six, the chair will create the agenda and place certain items within the consent agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=660.751s">Item</a> number seven, all SBC meetings and or any SBC subcommittee shall operate according to the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=667.699s">The</a> SBC shall to the best of its ability ensure its meetings are reported by Medford Public Media and broadcast live to the district YouTube channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=675.848s">Media</a> requests for comment from the SBC will be directed to the chair of the SBC. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=681.71s">Number</a> nine, non-voting members will be called during the roll call at the beginning of the meetings, but their presence will not be counted towards a forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=687.875s">I</a> did that sort of while I was calling the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=691.138s">Non-voting</a> members will not be called for the adjournment of meetings, as this is just simply a vote to adjourn the meeting, and our non-voting members cannot be counted in that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=702.468s">And</a> then item number 10, new members of the SBC will be on-boarded following the checklist, which will be maintained by the response committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=710.692s">That's</a> sort of our proposed set of rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=713.373s">So</a> the subcommittee both created and considered these rules and is bringing them here tonight for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=722.456s">So</a> I will open the floor if anyone has questions, comments, thoughts, anything they want to change, like this is the time for us to do that because we will adopt those changes as we go.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=761.926s">because</a> you may get in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=764.308s">And</a> that actually completely mirrors how we do public participation at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=768.152s">So</a> people are welcome to speak on any item that we're discussing, like members of the public could be weighing in on the rules right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=776.259s">But</a> yes, we generally do limit to three minute per person and you can't just get back in line and come back up again and talk for three more minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=784.486s">And</a> if there's a lot of public participation, we sort of can make those adjustments on the fly under our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=791.37s">So</a> we would, yeah, so we would add one time to that item. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=796.914s">Can</a> I see somebody with a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=801.837s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=822.428s">Yeah,</a> I think we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=823.449s">Okay,</a> yeah, we can do that for the next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=838.284s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=839.15s">And</a> I think they're hopefully for our purposes, the ones that will need to be used here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=843.673s">You</a> know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of like other things that happen when things get wild and I'm hoping we can navigate through those without having to have y'all go by the 200 page book and read about parliamentary procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=861.285s">So</a> that's sort of the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=862.846s">And</a> if things get out of hand, we'll adjust.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=908.185s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=909.746s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=910.307s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=911.167s">15</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=913.969s">The</a> rules have been adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=915.33s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=918.326s">Item</a> number four is, oh, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=923.228s">Also</a> under item number three is the onboarding checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=926.009s">So</a> on the next page, what we tried to do was just create like a little checklist of like the kinds of things that we're going to want to remember to do when somebody new joins this committee, which is somewhat inevitable and things that we want to make sure this group has, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=942.825s">has</a> done and is comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=944.246s">So</a> open meeting law training, for those of you who were here last week, you went through open meeting law training. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=950.951s">We</a> will send you like a little thing to attest that you did it just so we can put it in the file and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=956.634s">If</a> you missed it, there is training offered by the attorney general's office and we'll get the presentation from Janelle at KP and make sure that you all have what you need just so that you understand sort of the role open meeting law plays. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=970.383s">our</a> SBC rules, which we just adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=974.285s">We</a> would want to make sure new members get an overview of the MSDA process, which we did in the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=981.308s">Everyone</a> will get an email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=983.469s">I</a> think we're still working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=984.75s">Is</a> that right, Dr. Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=987.231s">Okay,</a> so you all, if you don't already have an MPS email address, you will get one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=993.074s">Again,</a> highly encourage that all communications about the SPC happen via that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=999.578s">Like,</a> if you use your personal email to do this, sort of open up your personal email to records requests, so it is not recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1009.023s">So,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1030.16s">Okay,</a> we'll make sure people have access to the MSBA website and our School Building Authority website. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1038.668s">And</a> that is a bit of work in progress, but I'm expecting we'll be able to look at it at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1044.013s">We</a> talked a little bit about that at our communications meeting, so more on that in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1049.658s">Obviously,</a> we'll provide people a meeting schedule and add people to our distribution list. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1054.162s">Robert's</a> was in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1055.143s">An</a> email to everybody else to introduce a new member so that everybody knows who to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1062.169s">This</a> acronym listing is obviously quite short, and I'm sure it will get much, much longer before we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1070.135s">And</a> so that's sort of like our brief onboarding checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1073.098s">The</a> other thing that we talked about was <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1076.71s">collecting</a> up exemplar documents from other districts so we can start to look at like how other people are navigating this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1085.432s">Stone</a> and Belmont, Arlington, Somerville, Winchester, and possibly Mohawk as a vocational school are some places that we would like to go out and sort of collect that information and make it available, not just to the members of this group, but to other members of the community who might be interested in sort of taking a deep dive into <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1106.465s">the</a> phase that we're at or what we're up to and how other communities are handling these documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1111.568s">So</a> that's our onboarding checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1117.731s">Any</a> questions, thoughts, Tom?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1211.238s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think ideally, they would be close in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1215.459s">But</a> Winchester, I think is a little bit further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1220.48s">But</a> I think the thing that intrigued me about Winchester was like, they're like, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1225.728s">their</a> overhaul of the building was maybe possibly something that would be similar to what happens here, where like the facade changed and they did it in state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1236.09s">So</a> there might just be something interesting there, but I think they were like a little bit further back than some of the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1242.271s">But</a> I think Stoneham's right in the middle of their process, Arlington is, Belmont is, so the rest of them are all very recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1249.033s">But</a> Winchester sort of jumped out at me because it's like a building I know with my eye that <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1254.654s">has</a> gone through like sort of started out looking a little bit like our building and has gone through that restoration.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1282.332s">Ideally,</a> yes, but they don't have to be if like we know of a district that has gone through this and like, particularly the ones where it went smoothly, maybe like those documents are the ones I want to see.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1312.369s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1314.831s">Other</a> thoughts about this checklist? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1318.634s">The</a> other thing that I think might be helpful is it's not as easy as you might think to find some of these exemplar documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1325.359s">So</a> Tom, I think we started creating a folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1329.762s">I</a> don't know how far we got.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1336.724s">If</a> there's anybody who's willing to, like, take on one of these communities and go find their documents, that would be amazing, because I think the quicker we can sort of pull all these into some place, like, the more accessible it will be for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1350.556s">So</a> I don't know if there's any volunteers to take on going to track down Luke.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1360.495s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1361.315s">So</a> if you can send those my way, I'll get them dropped in the, I'll get them to Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1366.358s">We'll</a> get them to Tom so they can be shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1371.04s">Anybody</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1371.68s">Aaron?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1371.98s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1372.601s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1375.002s">Aaron</a> will go digging, for example, our documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1378.443s">Does</a> anybody want to sign on to help Aaron?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1396.902s">I</a> think for right now, what I'm particularly interested in is their eligibility-based documents, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1401.926s">So</a> the same documents we're going to have to send in, like, they have to be in the public record somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1410.032s">But</a> I think if you look at a project that's just about done, those documents are going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1414.369s">pretty</a> well varied, I'm guessing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1415.95s">So</a> it might just take a little bit of digging to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1418.712s">But</a> I would be interested in what did other people put in their educational profile? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1424.095s">Because</a> that's a pretty meaty document, and I'm interested in what all goes in there, because that could give us good inspiration when we start reviewing our educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1437.103s">The</a> same thing with the Chapter 74 form. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1438.664s">Those</a> are the two big ones in the eligibility phase.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1480.548s">I</a> would assume they have access to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1483.149s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1485.89s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1488.412s">Other</a> questions about onboarding? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1490.733s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1495.895s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1497.176s">So</a> then we'll move on to item number four, which is review and amend proposed communications and community engagement strategy for the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1507.728s">So</a> the communications and community engagement team met and actually I thought we had like a really fun discussion of some of the opportunities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1517.718s">um</a> particularly sort of focused around the eligibility phase so um the first thing is like first draft of the website um our website will be connected to the mps website so it's not a standalone you know thing with a separate architecture it'll um it'll be connected um we have a dedicated domain um it is it all of our sites are secure so all of that should be fine um the basic structure that we landed on was like <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1544.561s">a</a> welcome page, like welcome and why, like why are we doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1548.243s">And</a> we'll, so Tom and I will work on penning something for that page. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1553.465s">We'll</a> have a meetings page where like you can go get all the meeting doc, agendas and minutes and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1561.769s">A</a> news page where like when we submit documents where we're doing press releases that all of that can sort of live. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1570.041s">We'll</a> have a documents space so that as we finish and complete documents they can be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1577.41s">Bios</a> for all of you will also be available on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1582.211s">And</a> then finally FAQs, which we'll talk about in just a second, but you know, ultimately sort of an evolving list of answers to questions people want to know about what we're up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1591.453s">Does</a> that make sense so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1593.434s">So</a> that's the website sort of broadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1597.274s">And</a> then we did talk about like <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1600.171s">some</a> of our community engagement opportunities in the eligibility base specifically because I think people are really excited to be part of the things that are going to happen a little bit further down the line like focus groups with students, focus groups with teachers, focus groups community members, but like it's going to take some time for us to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1616.726s">And</a> so in this eligibility phase we talked about a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1621.31s">One</a> was a community survey <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1624.979s">where</a> we would collect some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1628.101s">So</a> the questions that we have on our list is, you know, we want to answer your questions, so tell us, what questions do you have about the building committee itself and what questions do you have about the eligibility process? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1640.691s">We</a> want to know what kind of features are important to you, so tell us, like, what do you see in a reimagined Medford High School just to, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1647.003s">get</a> everybody sort of thinking and excited about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1650.245s">And</a> what suggestions do you have for the building committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1653.227s">Tell</a> us who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1653.928s">Are</a> you a caregiver, a student, a resident, MPS faculty? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1657.23s">What</a> neighborhood are you from? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1660.052s">And</a> are you a Medford High student, past, present, or future? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1663.914s">Just</a> to sort of get an understanding of like, is there a set of questions that's coming from primarily students, primarily faculty, et cetera? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1673.941s">And</a> tell us how you want to be involved in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1676.583s">I</a> want to take surveys during the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1678.744s">I</a> want a tour of MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1681.166s">I</a> want to know about your meetings in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1683.668s">Just</a> the highlights, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1685.129s">Tell</a> us how you want to know and be involved in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1690.333s">So</a> one proposal that we have is to send out a community-based survey to collect some input that will help inform those FAQs and start to get people sort of thinking about the fact that this is a community-based project for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1705.031s">We</a> did talk about scheduling some tours of MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1710.677s">Probably</a> not before the end of school this year, because I don't think there's like a single extra minute in the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1716.382s">But,</a> you know, really thinking about like, as we <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1720.366s">I</a> think that would be very appealing to people who don't spend any time in this building or don't have kids in this building yet to be able to come in and see like, what are we talking about here? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1733.497s">They</a> know what it looks like outside, maybe they know what the pool looks like, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1737.5s">But</a> is there some sort of curated tour we can provide people so people start to get an understanding of what this building is? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1743.645s">And</a> frankly, what some of the challenges are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1745.446s">I</a> think that needs to be baked into any sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1748.969s">tour</a> that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1751.47s">We</a> did talk about being willing to do more staff meetings with your team so if there is another staff meeting coming up for the end of the year or even next year that you want us to participate in you can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1765.394s">We</a> did talk we had this Luke had this great idea there's apparently a video from this back in the 70s when Medford High opened <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1774.08s">and</a> that it would be really cool to do some sort of like then and now of like what these spaces look like and how they've aged since the 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1785.25s">And</a> Maria is also in the middle of digitizing yearbooks so she has some history of the old old MHS pre-fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1794.638s">And</a> so we talked about this as like <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1796.6s">Maybe</a> a program for, you know, potentially our vocational students to get involved in creating something that would be available for us for like really marketing purposes as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1811.878s">So</a> again, nothing that has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1814.241s">before</a> the end of June, but these kinds of cool creative things obviously take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1820.004s">So</a> really thinking about how do we start to create some energy around what's happening in the building and what the potential is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1828.868s">We</a> did talk about developing a roadshow presentation, and Nicole and Marissa Desmond volunteered to work on a draft of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1837.632s">We</a> think that content will change all the time, but we do anticipate <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1841.744s">a</a> lot of reasons to go tell people what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1845.106s">And</a> so whether it's at school committee, whether the council wants to be briefed on a regular basis, whether we're talking to community groups, like we want there to be some common set of talking points so that any member of this committee could say, yes, I'm available on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1861.998s">I</a> can go do that talk and sort of carry forward for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1867.368s">A</a> couple of other things we talked about, certainly including some periodic updates in the Superintendent's Weekly Update, but also investigating some sort of, like, register your email to subscribe to this particular kind of news, which will be important for people who maybe don't have kids in MPS right now and aren't seeing the Superintendent's Weekly Updates but might be interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1891.821s">And</a> then we also talked about for the website, creating a roadmap that's visual that demonstrates like what, where are we in the process and what steps have we already completed and what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1904.765s">So</a> that's something that we'll work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1908.037s">Maria</a> is going to collect some info for us so that we can start to have tables at some of the community-based events like the Farmers Market, Family Concert Series, Circled Square, those kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1920.026s">And</a> so once we get there, we may want to have some poster boards of what NHS looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1927.14s">something</a> visual about our roadmap and where we are, but really just to be there to answer questions and create interest in the community and encourage people to be part of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1941.45s">Any</a> questions about that in terms of our communication plan and strategy in the eligibility phase?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1979.535s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1982.297s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2014.264s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2015.864s">And</a> I think some of the youth sports organizations will have a vested interest in what becomes of the property as well, because they rely on the fields and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2029.408s">So</a> that's actually a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2031.748s">We</a> can add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2032.568s">Tracy?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2076.618s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2079.899s">Our</a> website is building MHS, because building can mean like all of those things but I think reimagine is the other word that I like to use when I'm talking to people because <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2092.711s">it</a> what it's going to be is is not decided yet right so um and i think when people say well what's it going to look like are we going to do this or that i typically say we don't know that yet but you know part of this process is like is really <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2109.429s">an</a> imaginative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2111.511s">Like</a> some of us got to see Arlington High School and we went into a room and it was called the discourse room. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2118.357s">And</a> it was like a classroom, but it looked a little bit more like a college classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2125.003s">But</a> it was intended to be big enough for multiple classes to be in there at the same time so that you could like co-teach a lesson <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2133.19s">And</a> there could be like a debate happening and the room was structured for that right and so that's it like an imagination like point we don't have anything like that here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2144.322s">But</a> it's possible and not only is it possible it exists right and so really thinking about like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2152.19s">what</a> is possible I think is hard to do when you are tied to a building and how it functions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2158.111s">Like</a> you can say like, I want the windows to open or I want the lockers to be bigger or smaller, like, but to really think about like what isn't here does take a lot of imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2169.354s">So</a> I think re-imagining is a good word for us to think about using. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2173.655s">I</a> don't know if others have thoughts about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2335.646s">Yeah,</a> and I think what I tell people about eligibility is like, we've got to get through this in order to get on to answering the questions you really want to know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2345.873s">And</a> so we're going to move as quickly as we can through this eligibility phase so that we can start the real engagement and the imagination about what this could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2358.341s">A</a> third question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2468.496s">We</a> did talk about creating a mail list, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2472.24s">And</a> I think that's the place for capturing those folks, because we can create the list in such a way that you can tell us what you want to know about, and also, what else do you want us to keep in mind about you? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2487.354s">And</a> then we have that running list, and people can self-subscribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2491.898s">Luke?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2498.683s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2525.288s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2526.749s">So</a> I will, I've got that on my list to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2531.532s">Other</a> thoughts about the community engagement piece so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2534.735s">Maria?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2559.915s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2560.475s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2561.436s">I</a> will put that on the list.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2587.517s">Speaking</a> of the city side of things, we also talked about how best to engage our boards and commissions because there's a huge number of boards and commissions across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2597.276s">some</a> of which have like lots of obvious touch points with this school building committee and others maybe not as obvious but maybe there are some that we're not thinking about so we will build a separate survey for them for the boards and commissions to say does your board or commission have an overlapping and or aligned interest in our SBC if so please describe at what phase in the process should we reach out to you <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2622.944s">to</a> your board and commission for that sort of integration? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2625.866s">What's</a> the best way to reach you? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2627.087s">And</a> do you have any questions for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2629.249s">And</a> then also offer to hold some, hold informal sessions for those boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2634.172s">Like</a> they may say, can you come speak at a board meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2637.034s">So</a> we'll have this like little roadshow presentation that we can bring with us and somebody can go and speak to them and sort of bring back to the group like what they talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2646.861s">So</a> that's the idea of like how to make sure we're casting sort of a wide net across our boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2653.125s">I</a> would also like in my mind, I know REC has a board now, but we would also be trying to tap into the folks at Medford REC because they obviously have another like sort of another vested interest in what's going on here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2713.282s">Yeah,</a> I think there might need to be some sort of slightly different survey for them, much like there's something different for the boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2720.683s">So</a> maybe we can talk about that in our next, we have another communications meeting coming up, but we can talk about that in our next meeting and just figure out like, you know, how do we properly like get them into the fold as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2733.987s">Because</a> I think you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2735.507s">there's</a> this building is never quiet ever right so even when school's not happening something's happening in this building more than likely so just you know i think that is a actually a really good point i mean i'm aware of some uh just an idea of who all <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2759.404s">I'm</a> sure yeah I'm sure we have a list we'll have to work on whether it's an actual list or if it's a lot of things all over the place that we have to pull together but yeah yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2774.794s">Questions</a> Larry?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2828.613s">For</a> this group as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2941.488s">I</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2942.088s">So</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2943.309s">We</a> have a meeting on six, four, and I think having a tour of this building during that meeting makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2952.596s">So</a> I'll put that on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2954.837s">We</a> do have a finance subcommittee meeting before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2958.1s">And</a> I think the finance subcommittee includes more of the city staff, like Bob and Fiona, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2964.224s">And</a> so my goal for that meeting is for us to be talking about the, you know, just sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2972.02s">getting</a> to a place where we understand better what kind of funding needs to be set aside for feasibility study and for what, so that we can be ready to work with the council to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2983.008s">But</a> I think the other question we can put on their agenda is like, what are those possibilities across the city that this group needs to know about and start to be able to think about? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2993.455s">I</a> can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3018.349s">Oh,</a> people are chomping at the bit for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3022.991s">Yeah,</a> so once we get through this, the first thing that we do is we put out an RFP to bring on our OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3030.532s">And</a> that OPM has to be done by competitive bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3033.534s">They're</a> also chomping at the bit to be part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3037.317s">But</a> what we have to do before we can even get there is demonstrate to MSBA that we have a pot of money set aside that is reasonable to cover <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3049.475s">what</a> will be the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3051.117s">So</a> that includes the OPM and then ultimately the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3054.562s">So</a> the mayor will need to send something to the council that says this is how much money that we're going to set aside and this is where it's going to come from and then the council will need to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3064.935s">how</a> we think that's going to happen is that that money will be moved into the newly created stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3070.759s">So</a> there'll be an earmark of like this is money for the feasibility study for MSBA and it will get moved into the stabilization fund so it's there and it's ready for us when we are ready for it rather than waiting for free cash to come all the way back around sometime around now next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3086.59s">that</a> has to be in place before MSBA will move us on to the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3090.512s">So</a> we're working through the mechanics of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3093.394s">And</a> we've been in touch with the president of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3095.395s">So</a> he knows it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3098.256s">But</a> yeah, we have some flexibility because there's not a vote required. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3102.298s">There's</a> not a city wide vote required to fund the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3107.121s">So</a> that will that will come from our free cash reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3110.042s">And</a> that's been our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3112.104s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3151.212s">So</a> MSBA requires a certain process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3155.573s">And</a> that process really is like you can't sort of jump the line through their steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3160.735s">So</a> our goal needs to be to bring those feasibility folks on as quickly as possible and be ready to hand them something. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3168.338s">I</a> think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3169.358s">really</a> important idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3171.599s">But</a> more importantly, like we need to get them on the bus as quickly as we can so that they can make progress because we could hand them a whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3179.703s">They're</a> still going to do it again because they have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3181.964s">That's</a> part of the like prescription of the MSBA process is that there's no jumping the line, so to speak.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3224.279s">I</a> think we probably veered off track a little bit, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3227.481s">We're</a> back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3230.062s">And</a> then the other thing that we did talk a little bit about is that there is a question on the educational profile that does say like, what is your communication strategy during this time period? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3242.63s">And</a> so we have a couple of <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3245.202s">We</a> have a couple of thoughts there about how we are going to answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3251.464s">And</a> we'll certainly like sort of make this outline of what we plan to do a little bit jazzier and more cohesive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3258.587s">And</a> that will go in there, as well as describe some of the topics where we're expecting school committee engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3264.869s">So</a> for example, at our next meeting, which is on the 20th, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3271.011s">Mr.</a> Fallon will be bringing forward a conversation about expansion of certain vocational programs that they'll be seeking support from the school committee, like sort of to green light those ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3285.04s">That's</a> important for us to do and for us to take a vote on at school committee so that then it can be incorporated into our chapter 74 profile before it goes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3294.967s">There's</a> also a conversation tomorrow, is it tomorrow?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3308.968s">Wednesday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3310.008s">So</a> there's a special education subcommittee meeting of the school committee on Wednesday, and that group will be talking about the possible inclusion of the Curtis Tufts program to the campus through this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3328.176s">And</a> I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3330.282s">we</a> are all feeling like there's an opportunity to create increased educational opportunities for our students at Curtis Tufts by co-locating them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3342.01s">And</a> they're in a way that still like meets their needs because they do have a particular, like a sort of a different set of needs than being in a gen ed setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3352.997s">So</a> how do you sort of do both of those things is an important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3356.86s">And</a> we've asked the special education subcommittee, which is chaired by Paul, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3360.402s">to</a> explore that with students and members of the staff and come back to the school committee with a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3366.686s">Because</a> if that group sort of recommends that this is not a good idea, we should not pursue this, then we would not put it in our educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3374.01s">But</a> if they confirm that there is broad agreement, then we would make sure that that programming is in here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3380.994s">We</a> actually have a Medford resident who runs Somerville's sort of similar program and he happened to be at our meeting last week when we put the need for that meeting to happen on the agenda and he had just a million amazing things to say about <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3399.028s">the</a> benefits for students in the Somerville program, how the program has expanded, how this student participation in athletics has increased and all the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3410.019s">So</a> I think we're all thinking there will be like a pretty favorable outcome from that, but that is another place where we're asking the school committee to get engaged in something. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3419.609s">And</a> then the last thing is we'll have, I think it's next week, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3424.193s">a</a> meeting, a school committee meeting about our capital planning process, and that has to be sort of tightened up and in good order before we put in our maintenance documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3435.546s">So</a> all of those things are happening at the school committee, so we'll wrap all of that in as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3456.654s">Sure,</a> we can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3485.668s">And</a> the program today is how many students, Lori?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3491.312s">So</a> we're not talking about true consolidation that many communities go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3499.638s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3499.878s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3503.721s">Other</a> questions about the communication and community engagement plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3513.593s">Um,</a> is there a motion to approve the communication and community engagement plan as amended by our discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3519.376s">Uh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3521.857s">Motion</a> approved by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3526.039s">Um,</a> let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3529.241s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3530.061s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3531.322s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3532.743s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3533.063s">Dr.</a> Galusi? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3534.003s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3534.664s">Dr.</a> Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3535.504s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3536.285s">Marta?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3536.945s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3537.425s">Libby?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3538.166s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3538.566s">Marissa?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3542.884s">Maria.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3543.384s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3544.045s">Brian.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3544.745s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3545.206s">Tracy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3545.926s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3546.426s">Emily.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3546.907s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3547.427s">Nicole.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3548.108s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3548.728s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3549.168s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3549.569s">Luke.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3550.93s">Jenny.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3551.39s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3552.35s">15</a> on the affirmative, zero on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3556.333s">The</a> plan is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3559.463s">Okay,</a> we're making good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3561.345s">It's</a> seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3563.568s">The</a> last thing on the agenda was just to give you all a first draft look at one of our deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3573.382s">So</a> as you know, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3576.149s">There's</a> five deliverables that we need to submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3579.133s">The</a> first one is an agreement that has been submitted and complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3582.637s">The</a> second one is a list of all of your names that will be done before we meet next. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3587.764s">The</a> third one is the educational profile and that one really sets like sort of the vision for like <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3593.371s">What</a> do we do in this building and how do we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3595.272s">Both</a> today and how do we want to do it in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3598.672s">And</a> then because we have such a big vocational program, item number four is this chapter 74 viability program document. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3608.815s">Fifth</a> one is the authorization to fund the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3612.836s">The</a> reason that we're sort of, I won't say we're out of order, but we're starting with vocational first because this document is the most complete <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3619.494s">the</a> vocational programs have sort of the luxury, I guess, in this process of having already customized things happening in each of their programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3632.285s">So</a> where on the comprehensive side, on the sort of traditional side of the high school, there's sort of big, broad questions about like, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3641.238s">How,</a> how are we teaching and how might we do things differently the vocational programs all have that customization sort of implicit in their programming and a lot of it is driven by what chapter 74 which governs all of our vocational programs sort of requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3656.081s">So</a> what this document requires us to do is give them some information about our programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3663.004s">So</a> on the second page, what you can see here is a list of programs that we have that are existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3673.328s">You</a> can also see that we have our current enrollment for 23-24 listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3680.111s">So</a> this is our current enrollment in the program for each program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3686.037s">And</a> then a column for proposed capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3688.958s">So</a> there are a handful of programs where we are, we believe that after our school committee meeting next week that we will be seeking some. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3740.728s">mentioned</a> up certain programs because there is weight there there's a waitlist that's <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3875.951s">And</a> I see that you scroll down a little bit.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4420.727s">Yes,</a> we have done it before, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4423.008s">So</a> we have had students from other schools tuition in to our program, but the demand here is that we don't have the space for that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4435.431s">um</a> talk a little bit about like how what is the right mix of like accounting for that possibility and i think um that's a question for this group to really think about i mean trying to build capacity for a revenue generating program is going to come at a cost which isn't necessarily a bad thing but um <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4460.49s">It</a> also, there's not a super clear pipeline of how many tuitions could count on in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4471.376s">So</a> we don't know that we necessarily land anywhere, but just to say that our first priority for this group has to be our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4482.982s">And</a> half of that, half of every class is deciding to go into a vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4489.546s">And</a> I think that's in part because it's not, the vocational programs are not what you think of as the vocational programs from when you went to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4497.633s">They're</a> quite different now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4499.795s">And</a> there's a tremendous number of them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4543.243s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4544.223s">I</a> knew you were going to have something to say.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4746.611s">Are</a> there questions, Luke?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4804.696s">Terms</a> of our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4806.5s">One</a> of the things that was sort of interesting is like this does. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4809.696s">you</a> know, there's a completely separate track that we would have to pursue with DESE to be approved to have these programs, which is sort of separate and apart from like having the space to have the program, which is what MSBA is here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4822.639s">So</a> that's sort of a different work stream that would have to sort of move alongside of us, but more on the administration side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4831.421s">But</a> the other thing that if you look at section C, if you're adding new programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4838.018s">it</a> does ask a series of questions to make sure that what you're adding is in alignment with what your area requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4849.161s">So</a> if you were like, well, I have an agricultural program, and you look around the immediate area, and there's no call for that in the field, then MSBA and DEFI, because DEFI will review and approve this as well, will say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4864.645s">you</a> can do that, but we're not going to pay for it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4866.666s">So</a> Chad did look at the regional blueprints in terms of like getting to this, cultivating this list of programs that we're going to potentially seek to expand because these are the ones that are supported by our regional blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4880.488s">And</a> so there's sort of a, I'll say a straighter line there in terms of what we might be able to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4889.81s">Other</a> questions, thoughts, comments about this form? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4896.294s">the</a> easier of the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4897.495s">So</a> I thought we'd start here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4901.537s">If</a> any of you have questions or thoughts as you're reading this, as you're thinking about it, can they send them to you, Chad? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4908.462s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4908.962s">So</a> Chad will take your individual questions and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4913.765s">On</a> Monday at the school committee, Chad will be presenting about this, about the potential expansion of the particular programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4923.591s">And</a> you all are welcome at the school committee meeting all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4927.196s">I'm</a> sure it will be another lively meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4928.918s">We</a> will try to schedule the agenda such that Chad doesn't have to be there all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4934.986s">So</a> we'll look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4936.668s">And</a> then, you know, ideally the presentation will go well and the school committee will <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4942.082s">take</a> a vote to approve support of Chad's plan that he's going to outline for us, and then we can include that in this before you all see it again when we finalize. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4952.044s">Peter?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4956.345s">No,</a> it just says that they need to provide a copy of the meeting minutes, which include the language and outcome of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4968.081s">Um,</a> and it does say to be studied as part of the feasibility study for the proposed project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4972.943s">So</a> we'll like craft. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4974.423s">I'll</a> craft a motion that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4977.224s">Wraps</a> all those buzzwords in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4981.086s">Other</a> questions about this document? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4983.367s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4988.548s">Feel</a> free to reach out to Chad if you have any other thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4992.49s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4996.147s">cfallon</a> at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5001.07s">Once</a> you all have your email addresses, you'll be able to find him in the directory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5003.552s">Our</a> next meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5010.019s">Our</a> next full committee meeting is on June 4th here, so we will plan a tour of Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5017.786s">We</a> will hopefully approve our Chapter 74 form for submission, and we'll do a first review of the educational profile, and I will do my level best to make sure you have that a couple of days ahead of time so you don't have to speed read on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5031.119s">Um,</a> so all of that to come for June 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5035.001s">Um,</a> and then, um, our subcommittee, we have another communications and community engagement subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5040.743s">Now</a> that we have sort of the support of this group, we'll get working on some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5045.985s">the</a> surveying and that kind of thing, so that can get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5049.006s">And</a> then also before our next full committee meeting is a finance subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5055.509s">For</a> those of you who weren't here the last time, if you are interested in being part of any of the subcommittees, you can just let me know and we'll add you to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5062.393s">Provided</a> that there's not too many people on the list, folks are welcome to join any of those subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5069.596s">So,</a> so far we have rules and onboarding, communications and community engagement, and then finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5075.798s">Um,</a> any other questions before we make a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5087.085s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5090.807s">Seconded</a> by Aaron. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5092.868s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5093.809s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5094.729s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5095.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5095.99s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5097.451s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5097.891s">Dr.</a> Galusi? <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5099.132s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=5099.392s">Dr.</a> Cushing?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=11.734s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=12.115s">I'll</a> just give everyone a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=112.792s">123</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=124.457s">hi</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=129.4s">Okay</a> i'm going to go ahead and get started and. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=135.836s">so</a> that we can meet you later.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=163.635s">So</a> I'm going to read the meeting notice so we can get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=169.461s">Please</a> be advised that on May 8th, 2024 at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=171.321s">there'll</a> be an MSBA Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=179.383s">The</a> meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast 9, 8, or 22, and Verizon 43, 45, or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=191.466s">The</a> meeting will be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=193.226s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log into Zoom using the following meeting ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=198.847s">It's</a> 942-9634-5391. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=206.872s">Questions</a> or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=213.516s">Those</a> submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=223.242s">Okay,</a> so without further ado, I'm gonna go ahead and take the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=230.153s">Jenny</a> Graham here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=232.414s">Maria</a> Dorsey here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=237.097s">Nicole</a> Morell here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=238.877s">What's</a> happening to my spreadsheet here? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=243.179s">It's</a> a little cranky. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=245.06s">Marissa</a> Desmond here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=247.362s">Hi</a> Marissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=249.843s">Tom</a> Dalton here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=253.084s">And</a> Luke Preissner. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=256.032s">I</a> don't see Luke yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=263.382s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=266.086s">Okay,</a> so our agenda for the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=270.852s">We</a> have just a handful of things to talk a little bit about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=275.355s">And</a> essentially all of this information will feed back into a report that I'll give to the school committee on May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=284.902s">So</a> the goal for tonight is to sort of hash through these things in sufficient detail that we can then bring them to the school committee so they understand some of the objectives that we're pursuing from a communications and community engagement perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=300.18s">As</a> you know, there were like 104 or 105 people who wanted to be on the building committee and they were all like very qualified for any number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=312.398s">And</a> we can't have a committee of 105 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=317.204s">or</a> actually 115 by the time it's all said and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=321.186s">So,</a> I think people are rightfully excited about the project and they wanna know how they can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=328.23s">And</a> I think that goes not just for the folks that applied for the building committee and were not selected, but also just for the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=336.474s">And</a> I think if you sort of tune into what you're seeing, people ask about, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=342.157s">you</a> know again we're sort of in this like paperwork phase where we have a lot of like legwork to do before we get to the exciting stuff that is going to answer the questions people really have like where will it be and what will it look like and will Medford High be renovated or will it be new or will it be some sort of thing in the middle and and how much will it cost and when will it be done so all of those are like the real exciting questions that I think people <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=367.748s">want</a> to get to, but we've got to sort of make our way there over the coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=374.01s">So</a> I think just talking through some of that I think is important for us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=379.551s">I'm</a> going to try to take notes and then firm it up for the larger group. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=387.953s">you</a> know this is a small group so I want to make sure people just feel like they can participate and we'll just sort of plug away at the agenda one piece at a time and hopefully we will not need two full hours to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=399.641s">Does</a> that sound good? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=403.103s">Okay</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=405.004s">So</a> the first thing I wanted to talk through a little bit was the first draft of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=410.228s">So</a> Tom is actually going to give us a little bit of an update on that and <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=417.501s">just</a> where we're at and what sort of his vision is. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=419.902s">Hi</a> Luke, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=423.462s">And</a> talk a little bit about like where we are in terms of the formation of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=427.723s">So</a> Tom, I'm gonna turn it over to you to give everyone an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=430.184s">And</a> then I'm assuming this group may have some suggestions or thoughts to help inform that first vision.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=576.407s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=577.928s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=587.056s">Are</a> you able to share, Tom?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=613.941s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=841.017s">Luke,</a> did I see that you had a question in the chat?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1100.953s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1102.202s">I</a> love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1103.162s">And</a> it actually goes to sort of one of our other agenda items, which is like, what are those community engagement opportunities? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1111.824s">So</a> we can definitely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1114.525s">I</a> think keeping it simple obviously makes it easier to execute on, but based on what you're saying, Luke, the two things that I captured in terms of like what we would want to know is like, what questions do you have about this <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1131.309s">building</a> process? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1133.43s">And</a> what are you looking for in a reimagined Medford High School? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1142.372s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1142.652s">I</a> mean, are there other questions that you think would be important to pose to folks?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1196.469s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1203.641s">I'm</a> going to actually I just realized I'm not sharing my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1205.624s">So</a> I'm I'm capturing all this as we talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1207.867s">So</a> let me share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1213.354s">Can</a> you see my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1216.117s">Yes,</a> OK, perfect Maria.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1259.196s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1260.576s">That's</a> actually a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1263.177s">Thomas</a> and I had talked a little bit about like <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1265.737s">pinning</a> like a welcome on the page to just say like, welcome to this page, this is what you can find here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1272.719s">We're</a> all really excited about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1274.28s">So</a> I think we could do, we could pull that like why into that landing page so that people can hear some of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1284.183s">And</a> I think we'll get a lot of those FAQs in terms of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1288.86s">how</a> will we pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1290.101s">And</a> I actually think some of those answers are gonna start to like flush out really quickly, you know, in terms of like, how will we pay for the feasibility study? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1299.866s">All</a> those answers are gonna come really fast because we actually have a short window to set aside our feasibility money here in Medford because free cash will be available only until June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1310.713s">So</a> we will need to get that done before June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1313.874s">So,</a> you know, we will have, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1317.059s">You</a> know, if the plan continues to be to use free free cash, we will have to get a favorable vote from the council to move that money earmarked into this into the <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1330.393s">Oh</a> my God, what's the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1334.915s">Sustainability</a> fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1336.596s">Oh</a> my God, it starts with an S. Stability fund, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1342.018s">Into</a> the stability fund before June 30 so that it is there and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1347.96s">Stabilization,</a> yes, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1349.241s">So</a> yeah, I think there will be a lot of good questions about that along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1354.303s">And</a> I do like the idea of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1360.612s">asking</a> people what they want to know before we push out like just a pile of FAQs, because I think we can anticipate reasonably the questions people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1368.881s">This</a> committee is 25 people, like I think we have a good sort of perspective on that, but to the point of community engagement, I think I want to hear from people first before we start telling them what questions we think that they have, right, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1396.635s">So</a> I have three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1400.357s">What</a> questions do you have about the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1404.16s">What</a> questions do you have about the MSBA eligibility process? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1408.163s">And</a> this is not a full question, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1414.525s">What</a> do you want to see in a re-imagined MHS? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1423.952s">How's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1426.854s">That's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1428.075s">Do</a> we wanna know, you know, we do a lot of surveying where we're collecting demographic information. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1434.139s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1472.262s">think</a> we can probably do both ask like try to inform the FAQ and start to get people excited about yeah like what might this look like in the end like I you know I was able to take a tour of Arlington High School and um they they just had stuff that like <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1494.141s">Certainly</a> I didn't have when I went to high school, and MHS doesn't have like they had this discord, they had a room they called it the discourse room and had like discourse on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1504.465s">And</a> it was like a shared classroom space where multiple classrooms could convene together. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1511.647s">do</a> things like have debates and it was it's set up in a fashion that sort of facilitates that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1519.012s">And</a> of course, the principles like here's the one thing I don't like about this room, but in general, it was like the idea of like collaboration space for classrooms to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1530.18s">was</a> I was just like, oh, if you ask me what I wanted in a building, I never could have described that because it's beyond anything I've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1538.387s">And</a> I don't work in schools every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1540.529s">So</a> there's stuff like that where like, I think asking people what they want to see is going to give us like some like really fascinating ideas because people in Medford have been everywhere and have all kinds of different experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1553.92s">And</a> it might just give us some good food for thought to help us inform the <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1560.303s">educational</a> profile, like ask as well, which I think is pretty exciting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1656.872s">something</a> like this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1737.127s">Yeah,</a> we can give it a little bit of a preamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1761.163s">And</a> we can include a link to the statement of interest as well if somebody really wants to dive in.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1793.251s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1861.975s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1888.979s">Something</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1892.24s">Click</a> any of these that apply.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1907.503s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1908.083s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1913.277s">I</a> guess the other sort of question sort of to zoom out from like the survey, which I think is a great idea to start to get people familiar with what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1923.326s">I</a> wanted to talk a little bit with this group about other things we should be thinking about doing during this eligibility phase to draw in and keep the community informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1939.393s">I</a> don't know if anybody has thoughts on like things they've seen other committees do in this phase or ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1945.038s">Like,</a> I think, you know, the obvious thing is like, I think at some point we should offer some tours of MHS because there's plenty of people who have never been inside MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1956.508s">And,</a> you know, there's plenty of people who have been inside MHS, but it's been, you know, many years or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1965.55s">or</a> something else entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1966.89s">So</a> we may wanna sort of think about some tour dates of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1972.832s">And</a> I don't think that necessarily has to be like in the next like gauntlet of 60 days, because the next 60 days are like very sort of brutal in terms of calendars, but we could even schedule them for the fall and think about what do we wanna see in those tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1990.553s">But</a> that's just like one thought that I had in terms of like obvious engagement things. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1995.82s">Wasn't</a> sure if anybody had any other thoughts about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2001.653s">Yep,</a> like I said, my big goal is that we're done long before January, but even if we are like, there's no building before January, so we have time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2044.428s">It's</a> in the reactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2046.01s">It's</a> in the reactions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2082.206s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2086.485s">Okay,</a> Luke.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2181.243s">Yeah,</a> I think that sounds amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2183.484s">Actually,</a> the thing that comes to mind is the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2187.206s">Like,</a> I imagine when it was built, it was like the bee's knees, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2192.009s">Like,</a> it's like an amazing theater with all this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2196.332s">And</a> now if you talk to the Medford High drama students who just put on a show, they're like, why can you only hear one voice at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2205.077s">And</a> it's because the technology is dated and it's, that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2209.139s">sort</a> of all it's capable of, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2211.741s">So</a> I think that that could be such a like cool, fun, creative project. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2217.166s">And</a> we have a media tech group of students who I'm sure could do some pretty amazing things with that concept, especially if there is this like this video from the 70s, that could be very cool.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2240.285s">Do</a> you have it handy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2413.986s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2414.687s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2415.107s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2417.264s">What</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2418.825s">The</a> other sort of related communication piece for the eligibility phase, I thought, was during the application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2428.813s">We</a> got some notes from some of our various boards and commissions and people who applied who said, I also am on this board or commission in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2440.663s">And</a> I think you need to be connected to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2442.725s">So</a> I think the other thing I'm interested in talking about from an engagement perspective is, who are those boards and commissions that we should be thinking about reaching out to? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2453.274s">And</a> do we maybe do some outreach to them to say, here's roughly what the process looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2461.092s">tell</a> us what the, you tell us what the right time is to be connected to you, or have a conversation with us so we can figure that out, because I don't think everybody is going to be interested in all of the phases, but, you know, and there may be some commissions that are not <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2479.918s">so</a> directly connected at all, but there may be, there are probably many that are connected and might want to sort of be starting to think about their place in this process as an independent commission from the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2495.771s">So</a> I don't know if maybe like our short-term approach is just to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2503.57s">survey</a> them separately with a separate set of questions, or if you all have any other thoughts about how we might engage with our boards and commissions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2557.577s">Yeah,</a> I mean, we certainly can develop a roadshow presentation that, you know, we can just like sort of pick it up off the shelf and and send somebody to the meeting, but they have like that assistive support. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2569.061s">So</a> I think that makes a lot of sense as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2615.891s">So</a> Marissa, are you thinking like we hold like, you know, a summer meeting or something that invites all of our boards and commissions to come in here, like an info presentation to sort of warm up?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2661.36s">Okay,</a> so we were thinking about surveying boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2665.823s">Does</a> your board or mission have a topical interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2677.05s">Is</a> that the right word? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2677.931s">A</a> topical interest in the school building committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2697.098s">That</a> the right appeals clunky but <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2740.351s">multiple</a> choice there just so we don't get a million different answers.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2757.247s">Do</a> our boards and commissions have like a scope or like a charter or something?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2806.846s">I</a> like overlapping. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2808.246s">It's</a> either overlapping and or aligned, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2811.807s">Like</a> there's probably, like I'm imagining we're gonna wanna talk to like the Bicycle Commission and Walk Medford and the Disability Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2823.189s">There's</a> lots of them and they all have sort of different things that they probably wanna weigh in on and be part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2829.11s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2836.573s">And</a> then what is the best way to reach you? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2846.18s">And</a> do you have any questions for? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2868.636s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2872.798s">Um,</a> other thoughts on like near range community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2879.981s">The</a> other things that I, I sort of been thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2883.763s">There</a> are like I said, last was it just last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2888.151s">There</a> are some things that are sort of the purview of the school committee to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2893.474s">So</a> for example, will we be going after expanded vocational programming? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2903.138s">And</a> if so, which ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2904.899s">And</a> that presentation is scheduled to come to the school committee, I believe, on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2911.024s">And</a> so there's some overlap will certainly want to make sure that school building committee members know that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2917.028s">But</a> that will inform the chapter 74 document that we need to fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2924.914s">Because</a> if we say yes, we want to have a new program and it needs to have this kind of capacity, it needs to go you know honor by honor chapter 74 form in order to be part of the process at all so. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2935.397s">There's</a> some, I think some things like that, and Curtis Tufts, the co-location of Curtis Tufts, where we have some subcommittee meetings scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2946.022s">And</a> I think the other big topic where that might happen is when we talk about all of our early childhood programming and, you know, any sort of changes there, which I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2959.259s">administration</a> still sort of working through, but there are some things like that as well that like the way to, you know, sort of know what's going on is maybe not just like just tuning into the school building committee, but also there's some like topical things that are going to happen outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2976.096s">So</a> I'm just wondering if Thomas, maybe we need to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2984.755s">framing</a> some sort of like periodic update about those kinds of things into the superintendent's weekly memo so that if there is something like that where it's like sort of crossover related that we can describe it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3049.305s">Do</a> we create a separate mail list, Tom, for people who are specifically interested in school in the process?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3100.663s">Marissa,</a> did you have another question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3164.594s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3304.321s">Yeah,</a> I think we could probably create a pretty like simple and not grainy graphic. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3313.306s">Like</a> I just copied and pasted them off of the MSBA website, but they're not even like in the MSBA website in such a way that it really lends to that in a high quality way. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3322.171s">So</a> I think we could just create something pretty simple that would show people what the steps are. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3329.395s">And</a> we could just be like, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3333.155s">here's</a> where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3335.016s">We</a> are here and we'll let you know when we go to the next step and whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3340.099s">So</a> I think that would be pretty simple to do without, I think to your point, like making promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3352.826s">Other</a> thoughts about <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3358.058s">community</a> engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3359.279s">I</a> think we have like a really nice list here so far.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3399.633s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3400.153s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3402.014s">Share</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3402.834s">We</a> can move on maybe to the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3405.015s">So</a> I'm just keeping a list here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3410.718s">Can</a> you see my screen again? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3413.099s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3414.66s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3418.87s">And,</a> you know, any of the, forgetting what the like, not circle the square, but that's another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3438.06s">There's</a> another big fest down in the summer in Medford Square that the chamber puts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3445.544s">I'm</a> just trying to remember what it is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3450.27s">Is</a> it clippership day?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3454.831s">I</a> know I ended up in the dunk tank one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3456.532s">That's</a> all I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3457.332s">I'll</a> put clippership day, but we can find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3462.853s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3464.474s">I</a> think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3467.995s">And</a> then the last item on our agenda for tonight, and just applaud us in advance for moving <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3478.655s">amazingly</a> fast through this agenda, because I know everyone has places to go and things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3483.216s">So</a> one of the questions that we'll have to answer in the educational profile is this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3491.679s">So</a> it says, describe the community outreach that has occurred to this point and any future plans and goals related to engaging the community on the Medford High School project. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3499.901s">If</a> considering grade reconfiguration, consolidation of facilities and or a change to the current teaching methodology, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3507.583s">describe</a> the outreach and discussions that have occurred to this point and any future plans to engage the community on the proposed changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3513.908s">Additionally,</a> indicate whether the district has determined whether or not override or debt exclusion might be required for full project funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3520.632s">So</a> I think if we get sort of broad agreement on all the things that we described up above, that is our community engagement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3532.641s">And</a> we can write a narrative that describes all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3538.442s">I</a> don't believe that we are considering grade reconfiguration or massive changes to the teaching methodology. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3546.688s">Again,</a> with those like few exceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3550.01s">So</a> we can, in this section, we can point to those community discussions happening at school committee and those approvals here in terms of like other touch points of community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3560.957s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3562.697s">The</a> final piece is indicating whether we've determined if we will need an override or a debt exclusion for full project funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3570.302s">And</a> I will check with the mayor, but I believe the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3575.826s">I</a> don't think this kind of project gets done without that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3580.009s">But</a> I just wanted to put this question out there just to get the juices flowing and have you all think about anything that you want to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3586.054s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3605.965s">That's</a> a specific question from the profile.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3621.956s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3645.646s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3647.088s">Any</a> other thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3662.867s">I</a> also just wanted to make sure that we do have a member of the community on, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you wanted to contribute to the conversation, you're very welcome to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3673.882s">It's</a> a small group, so we'd love to hear from you as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3712.756s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3713.297s">How</a> old are your littles now?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3719.79s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3722.233s">Okay,</a> when I knocked on your door, he was like ready to go to kindergarten.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3749.505s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3750.677s">Marissa,</a> did you have your hand in the air or did I hear you come off mute? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3754.938s">I</a> just wanna make sure we didn't lose you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3756.739s">Yeah,</a> I did it by mistake.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3768.282s">So</a> let's go, I just wanna go back to the top and find out if there's anybody who wants to like spearhead any of these <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3777.114s">items.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3777.894s">It's</a> okay if that's not immediately obvious, like I think some of the communication stuff Tom can work on on our behalf, but I didn't know if there was anything else that anybody was like, I definitely want to be involved in that project or that initiative, because if you do, we want to make sure that you can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3814.22s">Do</a> you think you could help me with the roadshow presentation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3837.372s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3848.323s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3849.224s">Is</a> there somebody who is interested in taking on, like, identifying these events where we might have some tables and some information?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3897.45s">Yeah,</a> and I, you know, before this all got started, the principal, Principal Cabral asked me to come and do a presentation in one of her staff meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3908.255s">And</a> it was one of those like choose your own adventure staff meetings where there are like many things going on and people could sort of pick how they wanted to use their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3917.719s">And</a> now that you're saying that Maria I remember that somebody was like, are you recording this, so that other people who aren't here, was it you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3927.103s">And</a> I think I said something like maybe I should give this a test run before I do a recording but. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3934.106s">To</a> that point, I may reach out to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3936.968s">Cabral</a> again and see if she wants to host another one that we might record so that as we head into the summer that the folks who work in the building every single day have some sort of extra touch point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4018.097s">How</a> would you feel about <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4020.444s">taking</a> on the work of collecting these responses and when we get the survey responses back and trying to make some sense of them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4032.834s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4043.242s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4045.544s">I</a> did already. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4045.985s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4053.77s">Is</a> there anything else that you all want to chat about? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4058.717s">today?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4114.763s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4116.084s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4121.769s">that</a> you all can think of? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4123.39s">Okay,</a> so I need somebody to make a motion to recommend this plan to the larger committee because that was our job today. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4134.995s">So</a> if somebody might make a motion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4141.718s">By</a> Nicole, is there a second?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4147.181s">By</a> Maria. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4150.55s">Okay,</a> and because we are on Zoom, one of the variables of the open meeting law is that all votes are taken by a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4160.055s">So</a> roll call, Maria? <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4163.677s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4164.977s">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4165.898s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4167.058s">Luke?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4169.259s">Marissa?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4170.68s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4171.52s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4172.04s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4172.801s">One,</a> two, three, four, five in the affirmative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4183.655s">Okay,</a> and is there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4190.637s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Maria and seconded by Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4195.119s">Okay,</a> Maria.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4198.42s">Nicole.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4199.46s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4200.741s">Luke.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4202.482s">Marissa.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4203.702s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4204.562s">Jenny.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4205.723s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4207.063s">Five</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4208.904s">The</a> meeting is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4210.333s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4211.135s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4211.916s">Thanks,</a> everyone.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4214.743s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=4215.484s">Bye.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-05-08_M_PcKAypdrM/2024-05-08_M_PcKAypdrM.html">MSBA Rules and Onboarding Subcommittee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=81.821s">Maybe</a> one thing, I was just looking through our approved resolution to see if it was in there that the placeholder that you have around communications being directed to the chair, and I did not find it there, so I don't, it must exist somewhere in the ether, but I think the answer there is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=107.912s">media</a> requests for communication or comment regarding the SBC will be directed like via me so that the committee knows that if they get a press like request that if the request is about like speaking about what's happening on the committee that that should come to me so that I can work with the right people to make sure that that whatever we say is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=138.151s">I</a> was also wondering whether I think public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=144.539s">I</a> would like, I would personally like to see us adopt the same roles that we have for school committee around like <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=152.156s">you</a> can speak one time on a matter for up to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=156.099s">So</a> there's some specific language there in our rules document. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=158.961s">I</a> don't know how you all feel about that in terms of like, you know, I don't think we're gonna see a lot of public participation in this like phase, but I think at some point we will, you know, when we're making like feasibility decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=173.45s">And</a> I'm just curious, like, can we sort of agree now, like what that looks like? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=179.554s">And</a> I'm just trying to pull up our rules document to grab.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=184.397s">Oh,</a> you have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=188.72s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=189.521s">So</a> I don't think that has to be the answer, but I think it is actually already documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=194.804s">So</a> we should work from it and say that that's sort of what we're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=208.368s">So</a> public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=214.112s">That's</a> important because when we don't do that, we sort of bump into open meeting law issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=219.095s">The</a> chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=224.239s">The</a> chair will announce the time limit prior to the public comment period at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=230.263s">The</a> public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing or by email or by emailing them to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=236.307s">I</a> would maybe say the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=239.798s">written</a> comments will be forwarded to all members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=247.241s">I</a> guess I'm wondering, do we set up an auto forward situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=258.306s">I</a> believe that we'll have a general email box. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=261.801s">Okay,</a> again, and what we can do is set up like an auto forward so that if something is coming into that box, it is being distributed to everybody.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=281.427s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=285.028s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=306.638s">And</a> then I don't think we need that last sentence.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=314.501s">Thoughts</a> about that from a public participation perspective?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=393.364s">And</a> then I would just say via auto forwarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=421.577s">Um.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=438.433s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=626.796s">I</a> personally like that, I would propose that we write in here a rule that says like, we are residents and neighbors here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=642.204s">And</a> as such, we will address each other based like on a first name basis, unless otherwise requested by a member of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=656.613s">So</a> if you want me to call you Mr. Rousseau, I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=660.495s">But</a> I think my strong preference is people call me Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=667.319s">We're</a> all friends and neighbors here trying to work hard to get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=672.942s">I</a> just want people to feel like they're a part of a team instead of part of a body of elected people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=680.366s">Because</a> we're not, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=681.267s">We're</a> appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=685.262s">So</a> I don't know, that seems like, you know, maybe it'll work till it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=692.753s">But</a> I don't know what you guys think of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=780.144s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=781.987s">Aaron,</a> how do you feel about that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=837.233s">Yeah,</a> I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=838.553s">And</a> if they don't like that, they can tell us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=842.134s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=846.089s">Tracy,</a> the other question I had for you is like, I'm gonna make an assumption that you don't know what Robert's rules of order are. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=854.334s">Maybe</a> you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=856.856s">But</a> I think what would be helpful here is to like, I don't know, like what are like the most important rules <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=869.371s">can</a> we write them down so that people aren't like, where do I even find what that means to be able to agree to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=876.553s">So,</a> I mean, I think in my mind, giving them a cheat sheet is good, but even in words, to me, one rule is that voting happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=897.415s">on</a> the committee when there is a motion to do something and a second and possibly debate on that subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=918.342s">And</a> I think we maybe don't need to get into like, you know, if there's too many motions on the floor, you know, you gotta stop and like dispatch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=925.544s">Like,</a> I don't think we need to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=929.825s">But</a> I think saying like, when we have to take a vote, somebody makes a motion, somebody makes a second, we have conversation and then we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=942.507s">And</a> under the open meeting law, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=946.542s">voice</a> votes are loud, which means everybody, when everybody is in person, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=953.908s">So</a> we can just say all those in favor, aye, all those opposed, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=959.452s">And</a> as long as there's no question, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=965.297s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=967.17s">at</a> any time, any member can simply request a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=972.174s">Like,</a> I think that's an important structure for people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=974.735s">Like,</a> we're going to not call 25 people, like a 25 person roll every single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=982.4s">But</a> if somebody feels strongly that they need to know where people stand, that that's a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=993.457s">I</a> think the other thing about voting that I sort of am wondering about is like, do we call only voting members in the role or are we trying to like also record the sort of opinion of non-voting members?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1075.593s">I</a> think, you know, maybe another thing about motions that would be important to say is like any member may suggest an amendment to a motion and maybe we just say, and the chair will guide the group through the proper way to accept or reject that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1105.1s">so</a> that like, I don't need you all to know how to do that, but if that happens, I will handle it and we will like work through it and go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1123.347s">I'm</a> just like looking through my trustee Roberts rules of order book here to see what else we're missing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1134.918s">Yeah,</a> well, one other thing that I was just reading about is like, you know, there are typically like limits to like how often you can speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1146.745s">So</a> Robert's rule says you can speak twice on a topic for, well, where'd it go? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1156.991s">Hold</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1158.612s">You</a> may speak and debate twice on any debatable motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1164.597s">on</a> the same day, each time you may speak for up to 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1168.341s">That</a> is what Robert's Rules of Order says. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1173.686s">I</a> would propose that we amend that to be commiserate with what we're allowing the public to do in an event that things are out of hand, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1189.818s">just</a> so that people understand that like once we get to the point where like we'll have discussion and that's one thing once we get to the point where we're going to take a motion and vote like there is like diminishing there is sometimes sometimes diminishing return on like everybody talking exhaustively why they think the way they think when really like we just need to take the boat and let the boat go right so <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1217.125s">Obviously,</a> that becomes a problem when things are contentious, but maybe that's a good place to start.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1276.078s">The</a> other thing that Robert's Rules of Order talks a lot about is like how to reconsider something if you feel like the group has made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1285.982s">And</a> again, do we maybe just put something in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1288.863s">Like</a> if a member of the committee believes a mistake was made and would like to discuss a completed motion further, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1303.783s">they</a> simply need to alert the chair and the chair will like assist through that process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1343.768s">Okay,</a> that's a fair and important point because otherwise you're just going to recycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1349.21s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1381.774s">I</a> think we are required to publish and approve minutes for every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1386.695s">And</a> I think there is still some conversation happening about who will be responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1397.577s">So</a> that is something I need to get with the superintendent on to make sure that we have an answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1419.73s">I</a> think the other thing that we might want to mention is like, if we're going to take the agenda out of order, that we need to make an official motion to suspend the rules and take the agenda out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1431.573s">And</a> that's really because that's a choice that we're making that <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1439.341s">impacts</a> like how the public can participate in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1442.423s">So</a> if you were wait, if you knew that it was like the last agenda item, and we took it first, like you may miss it completely and not be able to talk about the things that you wanted to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1455.25s">And</a> so I think when it comes to making sure that we're appropriately hearing from the public, we want to make sure that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1464.315s">You</a> know, we just want to make sure that we are not doing that haphazardly, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1488.769s">I've</a> reached the end of my Roberts Rules of Order book, and I feel like if we can like work through these, we're probably gonna be okay most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1501.974s">Do</a> you agree with that, Paul?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1559.944s">Yes,</a> we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1563.089s">We</a> do that with certain items, usually like the minutes and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1571.633s">So</a> maybe we need to just say something like the chair will create an agenda and may elect to use a consent agenda to approve non-controversial items in an effort to ensure the meeting moves along. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1618.22s">I'm</a> thinking that we should move that number five, that we should move that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1625.766s">And</a> maybe number six, because those are like, if you only take a couple things away, those are good things to take away and maybe put them right after number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1670.418s">Okay,</a> what else are we missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1678.041s">It's</a> more than one page, but still seems pretty brief.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1697.065s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1698.105s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1698.865s">We</a> can come back if there is something else that we forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1703.286s">The</a> other topic for us to talk about that we haven't talked about yet is like, if we are thinking about the committee, what kind of onboarding activities and information do we want to make sure the committee has at their disposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1720.23s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1724.102s">We</a> talked to, you know, the three things I put on the agenda are tours, exemplar documents, and any additional training that people feel like they need, and anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1736.632s">So</a> those are some questions that I had more to think through. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1742.876s">I</a> have had like less of an answer about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1749.252s">that's</a> something that is like maybe worth talking about as a group here as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1870.205s">And</a> are you thinking that we can, we would put that checklist right in here? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1873.446s">Or</a> are you thinking like we're going to assign somebody to do that and bring it back?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1938.114s">I</a> guess me, I guess the chair, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1968.22s">Yeah,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1989.998s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1998.479s">Yeah,</a> we can.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2012.71s">Issue</a> an email address.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2056.25s">Yes,</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2059.273s">And</a> the other thing, you know, at some point soon, we'll have a website where all of this stuff can live. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2064.816s">So</a> it really could be just a matter of somebody from this team, like sitting and onboarding somebody and like walking them through those steps, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2073.199s">Once</a> it's all there, it gets pretty easy to be able to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2080.102s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2108.829s">Yeah,</a> I don't think we really want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2110.43s">There</a> might be some like big changes, but.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2206.294s">Yeah,</a> I agree with that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2237.472s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2238.613s">I</a> can't think of anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2241.535s">What</a> do you all think? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2244.276s">I</a> like the brevity, personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2248.139s">It's</a> not too much to wrap your head around.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2262.308s">Yeah,</a> that's the public comment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2284.988s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2304.544s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2307.308s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2308.269s">Do</a> we do we have any thoughts about. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2315.245s">exemplar</a> documents or districts that we think people should pay attention to? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2321.411s">And</a> I think that's a question we can ask the whole group, but I don't want the list to be so big and so long that it's like, I don't have time to sort of go through and find all those documents for all those folks, but it might make some sense for us to make <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2337.898s">connections</a> with like Arlington, for example, they're like in the thick of their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2343.642s">So,</a> you know, maybe even like Arlington, Somerville, Stoneham, Winchester, I don't know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2362.037s">Is</a> that Stoneham you said?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2364.579s">Belmont,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2373.114s">Arlington.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2376.596s">Somerville.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2383.198s">Winchester.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2386.42s">And</a> I think the appeal of Winchester, they've been done for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2390.361s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2391.742s">But</a> they, <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2395.405s">started,</a> I think, with something that looked like Medford High, so sort of interesting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2405.688s">But</a> like they, you know, they renovated in place, I guess, as it were, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2409.829s">Yes,</a> yeah, they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2413.23s">I</a> think the other question is, is there a Volk district that <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2422.532s">is</a> succeeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2423.452s">So</a> let's talk about the places that are having some trouble right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2429.115s">But</a> is there a VOC district in the area that is sort of succeeding through the process that might be interesting?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2441.441s">Maybe</a> we just write vocational question and we can open that up to conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2461.015s">I</a> mean, members of the committee may have some other ideas, but it would be nice for us to like, go off and, you know, identify who these districts are and sort of accumulate some links to like their relevant documents and that kind of thing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2501.432s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2572.58s">So</a> MSBA has a Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2576.221s">So</a> we could like list that and we could also <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2585.316s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2586.837s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2587.698s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2588.338s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2589.219s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2590.039s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2590.739s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2591.54s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2592.341s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2593.261s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2593.982s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2594.642s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2596.183s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2599.585s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2600.806s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2602.147s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2602.827s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2603.488s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2604.268s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2605.169s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2606.61s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2607.29s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2608.091s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2608.931s">I</a> think that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2609.592s">I</a> think that's a good point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2620.013s">had</a> some former school committee members wreaking havoc but um yeah okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2626.058s">I</a> think those would be like the two big things and then certainly like if there's something that seems relevant, we can share.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2659.937s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2664.642s">sort</a> of do our best to let you know when there's topics that are relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2668.666s">Like</a> there's one, you know, I think on the 20th, we'll have a meeting where we'll be talking about, the school committee will be talking about potential expansion of vocational programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2680.619s">And</a> that might be of interest for people to listen in on, albeit not required for you to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2687.961s">But</a> I think there probably are some big gate style meetings that folks who are able to join would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2698.383s">So</a> I can certainly let people know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2704.464s">as</a> it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2706.086s">But</a> I would say attendance is not mandatory to those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2747.504s">What</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2759.752s">Are</a> we done an hour in advance?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2805.295s">I</a> believe that is all left to the chair via the resolution.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2849.996s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2870.509s">So</a> is there a motion to approve these rules and onboarding checklist to the SBC?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2887.817s">And</a> is there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2890.592s">Seconded</a> by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2894.337s">So</a> roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2896.82s">Member</a> Olapade? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2898.563s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2901.681s">Oh,</a> sorry, Aaron. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2903.662s">Oh</a> my, Tracy Keene.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2910.267s">I</a> know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2913.709s">And</a> Jenny and myself, Jenny Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2916.031s">So</a> three in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2919.113s">We</a> will report this out to the full committee next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2923.276s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2929.456s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Tracy Keene, seconded by Aaron Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2936.42s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2937.36s">Aaron</a> Olapade?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2939.401s">Tracy</a> Keene?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2941.782s">And</a> Jenny Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2942.502s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2942.823s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2944.523s">Meeting</a> is adjourned.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2948.965s">Thanks,</a> everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2949.626s">Bye-bye.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-05-07_S39QSClb618/2024-05-07_S39QSClb618.html">Public Budget Hearing</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2661.712s">Just</a> a couple of questions just make sure I'm clear on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2666.724s">reductions</a> that are outlined here at the high school are saying six FTEs, and there are six departments listed, so it sounds like a reduction of one teacher per department, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2677.826s">Administrator,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2679.307s">And</a> does that mean our course offering is being reduced in some way, or is that, are we able to maintain the offering that students selected with this reduction of six?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2719.571s">And</a> I think we'll hear from some folks later on, but specifically, there's some questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2726.448s">drama</a> classes and drama club and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2731.233s">So</a> I know that there's a new theater offering this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2733.595s">Is</a> that being eliminated?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2766.081s">Second</a> question is when you said we're reducing our nursing staff to align to the DPH minimums, what are those minimums?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2781.431s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2782.632s">Thanks,</a> Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2785.874s">And</a> I guess my other question is like, we're already reducing, you know, a net reduction of 17 point something is that's about 2.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2804.266s">So</a> it sounds like if we needed to close another $2.7 million gap, we'd be looking at like another <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2812.099s">round</a> commiserate with that size, where would those teachers come from?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2858.454s">So</a> another 17-ish people. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2859.575s">That's</a> what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2890.708s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2892.588s">And</a> then I think the other thing that sort of struck me, and this is not a comment for you necessarily, but just as a general comment, when we talk about enrollment trends and we talk about seeing declines continuing at the middle school and high school, that will never change if we keep doing this this way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2982.692s">And</a> then I just wanted to say, you know, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2985.233s">I</a> know this is like the worst work in the world to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2989.856s">And</a> I will say, I appreciate the clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2992.517s">I</a> know exactly what this budget proposal is and isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2997.199s">I'm</a> not sure we've ever quite had that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2999.481s">So</a> I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3002.442s">I</a> also think the sort of the steps and the care that you've taken to be in conversation with our union partners, where there are reductions that are being put forward <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3012.645s">in</a> advance of learning about those things here on the floor is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3017.568s">I</a> know that's really hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3019.189s">I</a> know it's terrible news to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3020.87s">I</a> know it's terrible news to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3023.651s">But</a> it's even more terrible to learn that here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3025.932s">So</a> thank you for taking care through this process to be appropriately transparent and also <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3036.42s">in</a> collaboration or in conversation at minimum with our union partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3040.703s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3041.283s">I</a> really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3042.524s">I</a> think we need more clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3045.066s">We</a> need less big budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3047.067s">And</a> this really is a great example of what a transparent budget looks like, even if the answers are really very terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3055.953s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3058.895s">Member</a> Reinfeld.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8427.605s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8429.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8430.885s">This</a> is my fifth budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8433.326s">They</a> all feel like they've been bad, but in the first budget, actually, we went through an exercise where I think for the first time we said, if you could have <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8444.793s">What</a> you needed to make to improve student outcomes, what would it be and the list quickly was eight to $10 million right off the bat without a lot of strategic thinking or planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8456.984s">And</a> I feel like we're still in that same exact position. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8461.28s">with</a> one exception, which is that we've made deep investments in technology out of necessity because of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8468.346s">But</a> I have to tell you the idea that we could prepare students for the future without computers in their hands is absolutely ludicrous. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8478.313s">Like</a> we can't not buy equipment for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8483.757s">It's</a> like not giving them a textbook in today's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8486.52s">And</a> we have made curriculum decisions <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8489.949s">that</a> are central to using computers in lieu of textbooks so that they can be modern, so that they're not outdated, so that they access all the latest and the greatest, which is what our students deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8502.321s">But</a> we must be able to give them a computer to do that, because if we don't, they cannot learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8508.707s">So</a> I understand the idea that maybe we could wait on this, but we can't if it means students don't have equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8515.33s">Now,</a> if there's another way to fund that replacement, that is great, and I'm all ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8522.452s">And</a> maybe there's ARPA money left over in the city that could do that in a one-time way that would get us through that piece of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8530.654s">But</a> we have to plan for that instructional technology to be available to our students, because otherwise, we are not preparing them for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8538.015s">We</a> just aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8540.751s">I</a> am imploring the city to find more than $73,500 for our kids, including my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8544.934s">I</a> have a high schooler and a middle schooler. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8547.315s">These</a> cuts are deep and we're still $2.7 million away. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8552.358s">If</a> we need to use one-time funds to plug the hole, let's do that and then put this question to the voters so that they can decide whether our schools are worth funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8561.224s">If</a> we make all of these cuts today, right now, there's nothing left for our residents to have faith in and to believe that we could be better than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8575.069s">So</a> I really think we need a better plan that doesn't involve making $2.7 million more cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8582.432s">So</a> if I am really thinking about what I think the city needs to be considering, and I know <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8588.257s">You</a> know, a conversation that is much bigger than just this, the folks in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8593.525s">It's</a> the $2.3 million additional the appropriation increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8597.892s">It's</a> the $470,000 on chapter 70 and at minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8602.068s">It's</a> like $3.3 million on top of all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8605.569s">So</a> that's a huge ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8607.989s">I</a> don't envy the city for thinking about that, but the city has to determine where the revenue comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8613.771s">I</a> appreciate all the work that we've done to try to find proposals that we can survive with. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8622.093s">Another</a> 2.7 is not survivable at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8627.369s">I</a> don't want to see all the hard work that we've done together, educators, administrators, support staff, school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8636.076s">We've</a> made huge investments in this district, really strategically for as long as I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8641.74s">We've</a> bought new curriculum where the curricula didn't serve us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8645.503s">We</a> have invested in mental health workers, which are needed by our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8650.506s">We</a> are trying to make all of these forward steps and we just, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8655.882s">There's</a> no more forward steps if we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8657.864s">going</a> to cut $4.5 million out of the budget, $5 million, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8662.848s">It's</a> too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8663.989s">We</a> never had that money to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8665.51s">So</a> we can complain about how many administrators we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8668.293s">Spoiler,</a> it's many fewer than most districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8670.855s">We</a> can complain about how much technology costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8673.317s">Spoiler,</a> it's much less than most districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8675.759s">We</a> don't spend money on maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8677.4s">You</a> all see it every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8680.382s">We</a> are underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8682.404s">There's</a> no two ways about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8683.525s">Student</a> Opportunity Act is not going to save us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8686.844s">It</a> never was supposed to save a city like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8690.068s">We</a> need a different plan to fund our schools than we have been successful in finding in my four years here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8698.258s">So</a> I don't know exactly how we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8706.468s">I</a> will be the first person knocking on your door when we do finally, for the first time in history, put an override to the voters to tell you about all the amazing things we can't do anymore because we don't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8716.738s">I</a> will ask you all to join me, but we have to do something different.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13434.795s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13435.576s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13436.476s">I</a> just wanted to reiterate what, how our process normally works, just so that everybody understands like where we go from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13444.723s">So</a> we, this is a public budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13446.905s">It's</a> required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13448.046s">That's</a> why we were here to listen to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13450.748s">The</a> administration made a proposal to us with the direction that they've received so far, which is this is going to be a bad budget year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13459.315s">We</a> need to figure out how to ramp off of ESSER because it's over, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13462.978s">So</a> they, that's the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13465.444s">genesis</a> of what they brought forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13467.525s">I</a> don't think anybody here wants to vote for this because I think we all know how catastrophic these changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13476.389s">What</a> we will do is a two-part process. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13479.51s">So</a> the first thing we will do is ultimately agree on what our request to the municipal government is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13486.454s">So</a> that number could be a number that you saw tonight and it could be something else entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13491.926s">Um,</a> we have work to do before we're going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13494.907s">So</a> that's step one is our ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13497.789s">Once</a> the mayor's budget comes out, once the city council holds all of their hearings, once that budget is approved, then we will take whatever number is approved and we will have to reconcile to that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13510.855s">So</a> there's two steps in our process that is new in the last like three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13515.377s">It's</a> important because before three years ago, we never asked for one penny more than the city was willing to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13521.0s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13521.741s">That</a> has set a trajectory that puts us all here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13525.346s">So</a> the point of this two step process is for us always to be talking about what we think we need to responsibly run our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13533.617s">I</a> think this year, it's obviously much more complicated because we sort of know what we're walking into and how <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13540.885s">devastating</a> it is to come off of ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13542.947s">There's</a> 30 positions funded last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13545.65s">We</a> knew that this was coming, and we knew that this would be hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13549.254s">How</a> hard it is still is an open question that we have to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13552.917s">But</a> I just wanted to make sure everyone knew what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13555.22s">So</a> we're taking this all in. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13557.082s">The</a> administration's going to think about this, figure out how they bring forward updates to the budget based on what we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13564.709s">the</a> mayor's working, the finance task force is working, there's a lot still to do, but we will take two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13571.212s">One</a> is our request, and then the other will be how do we get to the number that we have to live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13577.254s">And</a> I hope that number is not 73.5, because we did not see tonight the path that gets us to that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13586.178s">We</a> saw a path that gets us to something, $2.7 million more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13591.547s">There's</a> still a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13594.268s">This</a> is not an easy process, but I just, I don't want people to think anybody here on this school committee thinks this is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13601.592s">I</a> don't think that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13603.834s">None</a> of us want to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13605.354s">Unfortunately,</a> at some point we will be the ones to have to make these reconciliations. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13609.737s">And</a> I just hope we can make a few less, least bad choices than it looks like we will have to make as of tonight.<h2><a href="../2024-05-07_b7dJktkvvbU/2024-05-07_b7dJktkvvbU.html">5.6.2024 Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4770.609s">to</a> lead up to today and where we are in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4773.931s">So</a> I'm going to talk a little bit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4776.092s">We're</a> going to bring up a quick presentation to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4778.053s">And</a> then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4786.718s">So</a> we'll talk about that in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4787.979s">But</a> Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4794.122s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4795.403s">You</a> can go ahead a couple of pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4800.748s">Keep</a> going, one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4801.889s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4805.332s">Back</a> in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4812.719s">And</a> we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4816.683s">But</a> that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4822.849s">So</a> tomorrow we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4826.932s">However,</a> the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4836.374s">One</a> of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4839.615s">So</a> in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4849.698s">There's</a> going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4855.659s">the</a> work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4860.203s">The</a> first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4885.692s">So</a> there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4891.235s">So</a> that's one thing for you all to start to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4894.837s">Number</a> two, what's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4896.698s">Can</a> I take it? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4898.21s">Oh</a> yeah, and I can share the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4899.69s">No,</a> no, I can share the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4901.171s">Yeah,</a> I can share all the slides with you afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4909.613s">Number</a> two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4921.275s">Number</a> three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4930.918s">Listen</a> to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4937.54s">That</a> means we care a lot about functionality. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4940.541s">So</a> we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4946.503s">It's</a> really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4948.823s">Number</a> five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4972.536s">So</a> that's a huge task. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4975.78s">as</a> quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4980.861s">But</a> in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4993.284s">Meanwhile,</a> there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4998.165s">So</a> we'll talk about that in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4999.905s">But</a> if you can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5001.106s">So</a> this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5003.666s">really</a> junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5008.269s">But</a> as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5016.215s">On</a> May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5020.778s">At</a> each of these steps in the process, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5023.806s">The</a> MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5029.671s">There</a> will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5034.435s">So</a> at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5040.2s">They</a> could also say, we don't like what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5044.096s">And</a> they could also say, forget about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5046.518s">So</a> our job here is that none of those things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5050.44s">Our</a> job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5058.105s">Okay,</a> so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5067.333s">Well,</a> we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5069.756s">But</a> that eligibility period lasts for 270 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5073.64s">So</a> by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5077.985s">I'm</a> going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5081.288s">Beyond</a> the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5090.111s">then</a> we go into the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5092.352s">When</a> people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5097.354s">They</a> think we're deciding, are we building? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5100.475s">Are</a> we renovating? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5101.696s">Where</a> are we building? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5102.796s">Is</a> it on the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5103.696s">Is</a> it in the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5105.177s">How's</a> it going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5106.237s">We</a> are not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5107.618s">So</a> please tell all your friends <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5110.579s">We</a> will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5120.09s">And</a> then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5124.434s">That</a> is where we vote as a community to fund this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5129.844s">I</a> cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5135.628s">Once</a> that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5144.374s">So</a> that's sort of the soup to nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5146.695s">My</a> goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5149.617s">We're</a> going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5155.401s">As</a> we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5160.445s">But</a> for right now, our focus is eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5162.469s">So</a> if you can flip to the next page. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5166.201s">The</a> eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5170.264s">So</a> go ahead and flip to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5174.526s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5175.247s">So</a> there are five things that have to happen in this phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5178.148s">One</a> is the initial compliance certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5180.85s">It's</a> a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5185.953s">It</a> has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5189.855s">We</a> are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5193.226s">Thank</a> you, Mayor and Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5195.067s">We're</a> on our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5196.968s">Number</a> two, the building committee has to be formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5199.289s">You're</a> all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5200.77s">The</a> school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5204.332s">We've</a> done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5206.693s">The</a> form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5210.395s">So</a> we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5213.796s">That's</a> obviously the easy part. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5215.217s">It's</a> paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5216.478s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5217.614s">The</a> whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5221.375s">And</a> we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5223.555s">The</a> MSBA will need to sign off on our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5227.556s">We</a> have met all the requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5229.697s">So</a> the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5235.939s">We've</a> met all of those requirements with all of you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5239.88s">Now</a> we're going to dive into the actual work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5242.19s">There's</a> three additional things that have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5245.692s">One</a> is what they call an educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5248.733s">It's</a> a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5258.558s">How</a> many classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5260.079s">How</a> many math classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5261.94s">How</a> many swing spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5264.421s">How</a> big is your theater? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5266.242s">All</a> of it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5266.982s">So</a> it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5272.757s">It</a> also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5280.154s">So</a> this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5288.318s">Because</a> between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5299.402s">So</a> this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5306.755s">So</a> there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5312.717s">I</a> have been meeting with the administrative team since February. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5315.677s">We</a> meet multiple times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5317.298s">They're</a> very sick of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5322.379s">I</a> would be sick of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5324.6s">But</a> one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5330.321s">And</a> so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5334.022s">What</a> do we do in this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5335.402s">All</a> the classrooms have been counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5338.483s">All</a> the programs have been outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5341.024s">There's</a> a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5347.386s">The</a> other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5355.203s">So</a> in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5361.225s">We've</a> been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5371.429s">We</a> have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5381.953s">And</a> so we started to say okay what does that look like what might. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5386.792s">the</a> requirements be. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5387.873s">So</a> we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5401.68s">So</a> last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5416.827s">about</a> that very narrow topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5419.27s">Would</a> co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5430.521s">There</a> is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5434.204s">He</a> is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5439.702s">He</a> talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5447.569s">It</a> has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5459.159s">So</a> there's huge, huge opportunity, but <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5462.426s">We</a> want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5474.518s">So</a> that has been turfed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5476.88s">Last</a> night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5481.064s">They</a> will invite current staff, current students, former students, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5486.129s">community</a> members, etc, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5487.992s">And</a> Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5493.139s">So</a> they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5498.706s">So</a> they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5503.092s">the</a> drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5507.355s">Because</a> what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5515.221s">Part</a> of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5523.067s">So</a> we will have to think carefully about how we craft that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5525.929s">But</a> hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5532.742s">Marta</a> and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5545.493s">And</a> so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5548.883s">Joan</a> and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5557.55s">Our</a> elementary schools are busting at the seams. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5560.192s">We'll</a> have to grapple with that problem sometime. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5563.555s">MEEP</a> used to be housed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5567.299s">And</a> we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5574.509s">And</a> that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5580.517s">We</a> also talked a lot about <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5582.74s">students</a> who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5592.627s">And</a> so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5612.82s">So</a> we are working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5615.802s">So</a> as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5622.367s">The</a> one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5626.931s">I'll</a> talk about that in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5628.992s">But</a> on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5636.818s">I</a> just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5660.402s">I</a> think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5671.064s">So</a> that's where we are on the educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5675.085s">Curtis</a> Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5678.366s">The</a> other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5686.169s">What</a> MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5697.778s">Like,</a> do we combine two schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5700.439s">And</a> so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5709.246s">So</a> we are trying to both think very big because this is <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5713.949s">a</a> one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5725.183s">So</a> all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5732.872s">Peter,</a> can you go to the next slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5735.177s">Very</a> similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5744.365s">Chapter</a> 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5749.77s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5751.511s">That</a> drafting is in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5753.012s">We</a> have to tell them, here are the programs we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5756.015s">Here</a> is the capacity of those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5757.937s">Here</a> is our current enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5759.818s">And</a> things like, what is our wait list? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5762.116s">We</a> also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5768.677s">Chad</a> and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5773.839s">That</a> is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5779.12s">It</a> takes equipment, it takes staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5780.66s">So</a> the school committee has to weigh in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5783.001s">So</a> that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5788.982s">the</a> chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5794.677s">Um,</a> and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5805.461s">So</a> we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5812.884s">So</a> you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5819.412s">Whether</a> 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5824.735s">And</a> so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5832.799s">That</a> usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5837.781s">However,</a> if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5849.428s">So</a> that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5854.773s">They</a> also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5864.315s">Fourth</a> thing, maintenance documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5867.898s">There's</a> a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5874.082s">So</a> it's things like, do you do recommissioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5877.425s">And</a> how is your staff trained? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5878.806s">There's</a> like 20 variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5880.908s">That</a> document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5887.332s">We'll</a> get to that probably a little bit later in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5890.219s">Final</a> thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5903.47s">We're</a> not ready for that yet, but we're making plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5906.392s">The</a> mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5918.078s">questions</a> about the process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5944.979s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5945.659s">So</a> the feasibility, this funding will have to cover the whole expense of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5952.001s">Not</a> the whole project, just the feasibility study, which is like $2 to $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5957.443s">The</a> city will pay for that entire feasibility study up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5963.007s">And</a> then once the MSBA certifies our reimbursement rate for the project and we are successful all the way through, they will reimburse the feasibility study that is commensurate with the allocation percentage that they provide us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5977.797s">So</a> yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5979.017s">They</a> will use that same formula and apply to the feasibility study and rebate back the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5983.3s">But</a> the city has to front this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5985.041s">So</a> what has to happen here is <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5987.363s">that</a> we would have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5988.004s">If</a> we needed to go out to an elect the electorate to procure this money, we'd have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5993.408s">We</a> do not anticipate that we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5995.95s">We've</a> got a funding plan for that, and we should be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5999.293s">So</a> we were okay there, and that will require a vote of the city council to authorize the funds and put it in a place where we can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6006.239s">But</a> we're in good shape there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6010.772s">As</a> I mentioned, all of this has to be wrapped up by January. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6015.897s">Each</a> has a particular deadline associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6020.701s">I</a> am going to be really aggressive and tell you that I want all of these things to be completed before the start of school next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6029.089s">And</a> wherever it is possible, I want these things to be done by June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6034.193s">Um,</a> so that is why we've been meeting and working and pushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6038.475s">Um,</a> and I think that, um, it's, it's important for us to stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6042.436s">So</a> let's, let's stretch and let's get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6045.717s">Um,</a> the MSBA will have their work to do in terms of, um, in terms of getting, um, the enrollment study certified and all of that, but I want us to be able to give them everything they need so that we can move as quickly as possible into that next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6059.842s">Questions</a> about timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6063.223s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6065.076s">So</a> we have just 20 minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6069.279s">To</a> that end, we have listed on the back of the agenda a number of upcoming subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6077.044s">I</a> would like us to think about and prioritize two things as we <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6082.888s">go</a> into this first phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6084.31s">One</a> is a communications and community engagement committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6089.496s">I</a> want sort of a subcommittee, which would be no more than seven voting members, but an interested group to meet in subcommittee to really be able to describe and outline our community engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6103.992s">I</a> think you all have seen people in the community express their concern for, is Medford going to screw this up? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6114.634s">Is</a> it going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6115.394s">Is</a> it going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6116.494s">So</a> there's huge community outreach that has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6119.535s">And</a> the sooner that we start that, the more successful we will be in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6124.356s">I</a> think this is a bigger conversation, though, because also in my mind, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6129.677s">a</a> huge array of boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6131.46s">Many</a> of them are interested in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6134.024s">And</a> so there's going to need to be some outreach to understand when and how to engage them so we can have that on our master plan moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6142.845s">second</a> group I would like to form tonight is the Rules and Onboarding Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6146.647s">So</a> just like you heard from Janelle, we do have to establish some rules of how we will operate, particularly around public participation, but just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6155.991s">I</a> expect this committee to be time limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6157.892s">I'm</a> hoping you can meet once, bring a draft back to this group, and then we can adopt those rules and sort of manage from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6166.557s">And</a> then the third committee that won't meet quite as quickly, but will meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6172.474s">before</a> the end of June is the finance subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6175.357s">So</a> that will be a standing committee that will meet and continue throughout the life of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6182.586s">It's</a> important to note that when the time comes where the community has to vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6188.113s">This</a> committee is not where that work happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6192.919s">So</a> if we are talking about ultimately needing a debt exclusion in order to fund this project, this committee is not where, like, let's pass the debt exclusion happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6202.271s">That</a> actually cannot happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6204.353s">It</a> has to happen outside of this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6206.976s">Um,</a> so this finance committee, I see this as more, um, providing input, um, and insight into things like purchasing, procurement, um, of our owner's project manager, um, of our architects, that kind of thing, um, but also to help inform, like, the fine-tuning of what do we need for feasibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6227.182s">Are</a> there other costs we need to be accounting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6229.583s">So</a> there is, there is some finance work to be done, albeit, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6233.604s">you</a> know, I'm not anticipating that that group will meet until a little bit later in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6238.906s">So</a> we'll talk a little bit more about like Robert's Rules of Order and all of that in our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6245.529s">I</a> know it's, everyone's like looking at me like, stop talking, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6249.19s">It's</a> 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6251.151s">So</a> I think what I'm interested in is like, if there are people who heard any of those topics and said, I really want to be part of <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6259.874s">one</a> of those subcommittees, can you just identify yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6263.499s">And</a> I would also politely suggest that the school administrators maybe keep your hands down because you have your own work to do to get ready for all the rest of what we just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6273.21s">So</a> you're 100% welcome to. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6277.174s">to</a> participate, but we need you to be presenting at the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6280.896s">We</a> need John and Peter to be helping with those maintenance plans, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6284.378s">So</a> if there are folks who are interested in any of those other topics, the committee cannot be too big, but it can be any size that we deem necessary in order to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6296.504s">So</a> those subcommittees, I put them on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6299.726s">We</a> will meet by Zoom completely on those evenings just to make things a little bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6305.85s">But,</a> you know, each will have a pretty specific deliverable by our next meeting on May 13, which is to bring back a draft of sort of what their proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6317.379s">Are</a> there any volunteers? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6320.262s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6325.707s">I</a> think it can be any number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6328.389s">It</a> cannot be more than seven voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6331.271s">But</a> I think if we literally have just taken all the school staff off the table, I'm not overly concerned that we'll trip on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6341.096s">But</a> I'm more interested in people doing the things that they feel like are a good fit for the work they're doing, for the work that they're passionate about. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6353.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6356.727s">Maria.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6357.308s">Communications.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6358.268s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6359.949s">Tracy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6360.89s">Rules.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6361.41s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6364.452s">Communications.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6365.172s">Marissa.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6365.933s">Awesome.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6374.859s">I'm</a> going to put you in finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6376.44s">How's</a> that sound? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6377.1s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6377.74s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6378.821s">Did</a> I hear something?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6385.438s">And</a> Fiona, finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6387.959s">And</a> can we sign Bob up for finance as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6390.379s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6392.9s">Yeah,</a> yeah, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6398.863s">Any</a> other takers for these committees?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6412.739s">There</a> are two people for rules and onboarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6418.442s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6419.542s">I</a> was planning to sit on all of the committees, but maybe we can ask Emily Lazzaro to be on the rules and onboarding subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6432.37s">Um,</a> and so I will check with her, but, um, and I have put Nicole Morell on the communication subcommittee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6439.117s">So,</a> um, we'll check in with them, but is there anybody else who feels strongly, or would you like to go?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6455.601s">I</a> think we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6458.244s">John?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6459.545s">No,</a> you have work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6460.847s">Oh,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6470.157s">There</a> will be a working group before we get too far into this that has to put together an RFP for an owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6477.463s">That</a> is not expertise that I hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6480.266s">That's</a> not why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6481.407s">So</a> we will be relying on everybody for different subcommittees over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6486.191s">This</a> is just in my near view what I thought we should start with. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6490.535s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6491.796s">Does</a> anybody have any other suggestions on things that must happen imminently? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6496.9s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6497.661s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6534.345s">Yep,</a> kind of sort of not, but not quite. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6537.867s">We're</a> not quite there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6539.207s">So</a> I think once we get through this initial blush of the chapter 74 piece, like it might make sense for us to sort of add that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6548.612s">So</a> when we start reading through those documents, I think that's a good time to say like, who else do we need to reach out to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6563.741s">Okay,</a> yeah, I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6565.362s">I'm</a> going to put it on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.304s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6585.563s">But</a> community schools is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6587.407s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6657.678s">I</a> can give you an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6660.281s">We</a> got this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6661.102s">So</a> we actually procured a URL that's unique to this committee, and it's buildingMHS.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6670.192s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6670.693s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6672.555s">So</a> the URL exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6674.698s">The</a> page exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6677.78s">Thomas</a> is actually working on the sort of bones of that community resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6684.183s">The</a> reason that we asked you all for bios and pictures is those will all go on the website, so he's working through all of that in his role as the Director of Communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6692.746s">Tom</a> has agreed, even though he is the outgoing Director of Communications, to stay on specifically for this project until we hire his replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6701.609s">So</a> that website is being built both by Thomas and some of our vocational students, I'm assuming under Lisa Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6709.793s">And</a> there will be a documents component of that where all of those publicly accessible documents will be so that when somebody says, where is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6716.396s">We</a> can point them to one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6718.277s">All</a> our meeting minutes will go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6719.857s">All</a> of our meeting agendas will go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6722.258s">So</a> we've got a whole structure in place already to try to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6727.441s">We're</a> not quite ready, but I am hoping by the next meeting, we'll be able to give our forum a tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6730.902s">that</a> website.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6738.866s">So</a> that's a tricky question because under the open meeting law, there really isn't a back end for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6744.587s">As</a> soon as an agenda is posted, all of its documents are part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6750.868s">And</a> if we are, what's tricky is if we are working on things behind the scenes, we are very likely violating the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6759.29s">So</a> the administrators have working copies of the documents that they are working on and they do not represent a quorum and they can continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6769.012s">Once</a> those documents come here, they will be placed in a publicly available drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6776.477s">And</a> when we talk about editing a document, there is no offline editing of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6781.06s">It</a> is not allowed under the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6782.842s">So</a> unfortunately, we will painfully sit here and jointly edit a document. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6787.725s">It</a> is truly one of the most painful parts of managing this process that you all have signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6797.131s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6799.014s">But</a> yeah, it is incredibly painful, but offline, the kind of offline editing that works super effectively in literally every other place in the world is not an option here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6826.757s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6828.618s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6830.02s">It</a> is absolutely terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6831.282s">We</a> have found ways to make it less terrible, but it's degrees of less terrible, sadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6847.319s">And</a> that is a surefire way to get yourself in hot water with the community in terms of how documents get edited. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6856.122s">So</a> there will, and when we do those, I find that those meetings are far more effective on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6862.124s">You</a> can sit where you need to sit and everybody can watch a document be edited and there can be no sort of idea that the document's being edited without happening in the open. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6871.348s">So</a> we have to tread very lightly on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6874.749s">But</a> yeah, it is a process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6948.428s">All</a> of those updates will come back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6951.829s">Any</a> other questions I can answer about subcommittees or anything else that was on the agenda?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6972.628s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6974.519s">No,</a> it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6975.8s">Is</a> proxy allowed in a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6978.322s">No,</a> you cannot assign your vote to somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6981.904s">As</a> we adjourn this meeting, we're going to practice voting because we have to vote to adjourn the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6987.829s">Generally,</a> that would happen via what they call a voice vote where everyone just says aye and we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6991.971s">We're</a> just going to practice a roll call because it's <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6996.71s">Again,</a> weird and awkward. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6997.692s">So</a> we'll do that to adjourn the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7000.716s">But</a> any other questions before we adjourn the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7009.096s">He</a> was paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7011.857s">But</a> I think the other thing that's worth describing is that there are a healthy number of non-voting members on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7019.281s">The</a> reasons for that are not because we don't want to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7022.483s">You're</a> here because we want to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7025.365s">When</a> the vote happens, we will not call your name and you will not vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7028.426s">But</a> other than that, you are a full member of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7031.848s">I</a> was cautioned that <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7036.33s">when</a> you have too many voting members, it becomes very hard to conduct business because you must have a quorum of the committee to even meet and conduct business. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7045.052s">That</a> all becomes very, very complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7046.673s">So</a> this was sort of our attempt to say, we wanna have a big round committee, but we also need to be able to like move efficiently and effectively and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7057.336s">So</a> that's sort of the rationale behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7059.865s">what</a> we did there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7062.026s">And,</a> you know, I think that, you know, the size of this committee is going to change over the course of its life, for sure.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7070.309s">Yes,</a> there are 15 voting members of the committee, which is also still quite a good number of voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7078.072s">And</a> we'll practice voting in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7080.993s">But</a> are there any other questions next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7085.549s">The</a> rules, the rules and onboarding May 7, community engagement May 8, and they will bring their findings back to this group on May 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7095.334s">So</a> the genus, the vast majority of our May 13th meeting will be working through those recommendations, agreeing on those plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7104.138s">Again,</a> so we're sort of in start mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7106.42s">And</a> then after that, we're going to get into the meat of some of these documents that the administration has been working on and start <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7113.283s">doing</a> a read through of those documents talking about what's there and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7117.825s">But</a> we're going to move fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7119.626s">We</a> did lay out the meeting schedule just by way of like a little bit of rationale there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7125.848s">We're</a> going to meet as best we can in person here at Bishop 489 for <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7131.536s">between</a> now and the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7132.798s">I</a> promise you we're going to get back to Monday nights come the beginning of next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7139.167s">But</a> this between now and the end of June, between school committee meetings and holidays, it was like completely impossible to actually hold that kind of schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7148.921s">We'll</a> meet only via Zoom in the summer, and we actually moved the meetings to Wednesdays in consideration that Mondays and Fridays are really very hard in the summer to get a forum of anybody to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7161.148s">So</a> hopefully we can make that work, but I did try to keep the meeting schedule light. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7167.452s">I</a> think there will be more subcommittees between now and the end of August, but this was just sort of a start so people can try to organize their busy lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7176.098s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7232.16s">So</a> I can sort of tell you that I think any lawyer would tell you don't put anything in writing ever, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7238.883s">So</a> that's where we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7240.164s">Don't</a> put anything in writing ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7243.085s">Having</a> said that, if you are going to put something in writing, in that kind of scenario, yes, it's a gray area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7251.108s">What</a> you should do is make contact with somebody and say, hey, can I send you my thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7257.851s">And</a> have you discussed these things with anybody else or do you intend to? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7261.493s">And</a> so if you can feel reasonably sure that you've got a closed circuit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7267.517s">That</a> you say to me, can I send you my thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7270.258s">And</a> I say, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7271.319s">And</a> I say, I'm not going to talk to anybody else about these matters, then we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7275.802s">It</a> only becomes a problem when you have then connected to a number of people that represents a voting majority on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7283.587s">If,</a> for example, you said, I want to tell two people because I'm not sure who's going to actually make the meeting, that's still OK because you're south of eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7291.333s">When</a> you have talked with yourself included, with eight people, now you're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7296.677s">That</a> is when you have violated the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7299.239s">The</a> tricky part is everybody involved has to have the same understanding of who has been involved in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7307.505s">What</a> did I miss?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7350.203s">We</a> are going to get everybody an email address under Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7353.606s">And</a> I would strongly encourage you not to use your personal email under any circumstances for any business related to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7360.751s">So</a> as soon as those emails are set up, we'll convert everything over. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7365.474s">But</a> I would strongly advise that you not use your personal email for anything.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7429.79s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Member Olapade, seconded by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7433.633s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7434.954s">Oh,</a> you cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7436.675s">Seconded</a> by Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7438.596s">Okay,</a> I'm in a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7441.718s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn, absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7445.14s">Marice</a> Edouard-Vincent, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7448.002s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7448.763s">Suzanne</a> Galusi, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7450.672s">Peter</a> Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7451.592s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7452.273s">Marta</a> Cabral. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7453.493s">Libby</a> Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7454.214s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7454.714s">Marissa</a> Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7456.155s">Maria</a> Dorsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7456.975s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7457.335s">Brian</a> Hilliard. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7458.356s">Absent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7458.676s">Tracy</a> Keene. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7459.476s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7460.217s">Emily</a> Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7461.077s">Absent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7461.437s">Nicole</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7462.217s">Absent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7462.598s">Aaron</a> Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7463.718s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7464.238s">Luke</a> Prisner. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7466.6s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7470.882s">10.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7471.722s">Affirmative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7472.382s">0</a> in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7474.563s">5</a> absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7475.164s">Meeting</a> is adjourned.<h2><a href="../2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc/2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc.html">4.29.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=3744.564s">It</a> means we're going to vote on those things separately.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8724.216s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8726.69s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8728.791s">On</a> one of the slides, it says partial decarbonization is the practical solution for the moment, but full decarbonization could be done in the future with more time and money. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8739.497s">And</a> it looks like the timeline for the Andrews is really through the summer of 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8750.704s">So</a> what does that mean for the McGlynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8756.326s">what</a> would it mean if we were to pursue full decarbonization? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8759.869s">Like</a> what is the timing differential between what you're proposing and what full decarbonization would look like?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8875.489s">So</a> I just want to make sure I'm understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8877.97s">So</a> it's about two years per school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8881.871s">And</a> if we were pursuing geotherm, like full electrification, it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8887.867s">three</a> minimum per school, maybe more, and obviously cost being the big variable there because of the potential contamination, which I think we all are worried about. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8902.133s">Dogs</a> digging there, and my dog digging there, and my kids going to school there, none of that makes me feel super warm and fuzzy. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8908.876s">So</a> I absolutely understand the contamination concerns on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8913.598s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8915.532s">scope</a> wise, what would it what would it look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8918.674s">And,</a> you know, frankly, do we have could can could we wait six years really for one of those schools to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8926.459s">Or</a> are you proposing that these two would be done sort of in parallel?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9040.168s">Yeah,</a> so just one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9043.57s">If</a> I am understanding correctly what your proposal is, that the chiller would be replaced with an air to water electric heat pump, and the air handling units would be replaced with heat pumps, which are also electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9056.938s">So</a> the remaining gas component would be the condensing boilers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9062.481s">Is</a> that accurate?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9095.753s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9096.614s">And</a> so are we saying that the scope of what you're proposing does include the insulation and the roof replacement? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9106.559s">Just</a> trying to understand where those are at.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9167.74s">And</a> why are you being clear about that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9271.496s">So</a> can you give us an idea of that estimate? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9273.176s">Like</a> what is that round number?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9325.046s">So</a> I think my other question is, when we talk about how would we pay for this, I think that's <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9333.1s">the</a> school budget has like nothing in it for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9335.501s">We've</a> started having that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9338.282s">We</a> could talk about why that is all day, but the bottom line is there's like a fraction of what is even needed to maintain the buildings in there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9346.225s">So</a> where does $20 million come from in terms of like what procedurally has to happen and how can we support this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9355.389s">Because</a> those two buildings need this work urgently and probably long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9361.772s">So</a> I, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9363.476s">concern</a> that we have taken so long to like get to the point of action, which is something that I think we have to just continue to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9371.098s">But</a> meanwhile, like we have a project in front of us and we're going to have to figure out how to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9375.959s">So</a> where does that where does that come from in terms of like the broader picture of the city?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10214.299s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10214.64s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10216.181s">I</a> just wanted to make a motion to approve the scope of work provided to us in this presentation and thank the team for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10225.149s">I</a> know we had a lot of really long, painful questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10230.216s">Thank</a> you all for doing that, but I just wanted to formally approve from our perspective this project and ask that we get regular updates from the group as the process moves forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11949.659s">Mayor,</a> I'd like to nominate Member Ruseau as the delegate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12090.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12091.734s">I</a> put this on and would love for the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to explore this in a little bit more detail to provide some input to the MSBA committee that gets going tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12107.546s">And</a> obviously the conversation around <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12111.363s">What</a> the students at Curtis Tufts need is an important one. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12114.885s">There's</a> lots of things that they just simply can't participate in in the current structure because they are clear across town. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12122.669s">And</a> there's lots of options from a building perspective to <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12127.065s">bring</a> them onto campus in a way that still works for the students in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12131.568s">So,</a> um, you know, for example, um, we, we have lots, we have an endless number of options because nothing has been decided yet, but what we do need to do in short order is help MSBA understand our scope intentions so that when we get to the point of talking about like, is it a separate building? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12150.54s">Is</a> it a separate entrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12151.661s">Is</a> it a, <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12153.374s">stacked</a> building, you know, there's a million choices and options. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12156.816s">But</a> the first thing that we have to do is describe the educational programming that we intend to happen on the campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12165.541s">And</a> so when we think about the Curtis Tufts, that building obviously is its own historic dinosaur, we'll call it lovingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12175.446s">But</a> it is its own sort of facilities challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12179.048s">But</a> more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12181.388s">I</a> want to hear from the teachers and the students in that program or who have graduated, you know, about their thoughts and reactions about whether this is something that we should pursue, knowing that we're five to seven years away from any of this really being able to materialize because the current building we know is not suitable for the work that happens at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12202.884s">So</a> we're talking about the future here and we need to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12209.994s">You</a> know, in an important way, because if we don't provide for it now it's it's off the table and can't be designed for and plan for so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12219.236s">I'm</a> hoping that the special education subcommittee can move quickly to sort of convene folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12224.079s">Lori</a> Hodgkin is obviously a non-voting member of the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12228.561s">We</a> have been working with the superintendent and Joan Bowen, and they are aware that this is coming and that this is the dialogue we're looking to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12238.307s">But</a> that is sort of a matter for the school committee to be thinking about as well as the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12243.69s">we</a> really just need to sort of move that ball forward so that before summer there's some clarity there because that will hold up the rest of our application and it's my goal for us to be able to move quickly enough that those pieces of the application are completed by June 30.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12303.297s">And</a> then subcommittee could be open to public, so definitely welcome.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12616.936s">I</a> would definitely love for you, I'm not on this subcommittee, <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12621.067s">And</a> I will be listening in, but I'm delighted to not have my calendar bottleneck you further, because it's a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12626.889s">But</a> if you can plan to attend that subcommittee meeting, where the point of that subcommittee really is to dive into exactly what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12636.532s">We</a> brought this forward for exactly the reason that you described, which is you can't build a beautiful new building and then ask some small number of students to go to a 100-year-old building <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12650.708s">floor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12652.25s">And</a> that's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12653.612s">So,</a> at the same time though, the needs that we need to sort of care for for those students to thrive are uniquely different and we need to inform our application documents to make sure that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12669.927s">accurately</a> describing what those needs are so that we can have the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12674.669s">So</a> certainly, I'm open if the committee comes back and says, no, no, no, this is absolutely a horrible, horrible idea, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12682.073s">But</a> I think more than likely, the subcommittee is going to come back and say, this is an idea we should pursue, but it has to have these qualifiers to what we submit so that we can really meet all of those pros and cons where they're at and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12698.573s">I</a> would love for you to be part of members of the subcommittee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12933.547s">Motion</a> to approve 2024-24.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13151.108s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-04-09_XPHQFz6BgV8/2024-04-09_XPHQFz6BgV8.html">4.8.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4346.013s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4488.581s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4490.522s">Before</a> we move on, can we ask that the superintendent send a thank you note to all these organizations on behalf of the committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5600.523s">Um,</a> well, all of these, um, sort of recommendations and next step be reflected in the budget that we see at our meeting after April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5610.625s">Um,</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5611.656s">Are</a> these going to take more time to unfold beyond that meeting?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5649.098s">Yeah,</a> I think it would just be helpful when we meet next about the budget, either to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5655.549s">that</a> it is included in the it is contemplated in the numbers that we're going to look at that we're looking at at that time or it's not and if it is like what are we saying we're changing so just if we could clarify that when we whenever we talk about the budget whether this is being reflected in or not that's i think that's my major question yeah we do that point point of clarification is that
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5705.394s">Okay,</a> and then I think the other thing is if we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5709.056s">I</a> mean, I think the other point of this, um, report was to say, should we be adjusting our, our rate schedule at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5718.018s">Um,</a> yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5719.798s">And</a> so I think the other question for the budget reports is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5724.199s">What</a> at what rate is he projecting when he is making his calculations? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5729.92s">So</a> is it at our current rate or is it at some other rate that we're going to go forward with or that you're recommending we go forward with?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5746.948s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5747.268s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5747.428s">I</a> think it's just whenever we're talking about the budget, if we could just be clear about like what rate we are anchoring to from a sub pay perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5756.293s">So</a> just so that we understand where we're at.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5760.495s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6898.691s">Can</a> I add to that suggestion that this go to the Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee for that review?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7009.23s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7009.77s">And</a> Member Ruseau is online and just can't seem to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7016.175s">Dr.</a> Cushing, if you could try to address that while we talk about the next resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7023.04s">Okay,</a> so item number 2024-18 offered by me, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee will adopt the following revised subcommittee structure for this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7033.407s">And</a> this is basically to recognize that we have a relatively new member of the committee, member Intoppa has taken his seat after the resignation of member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7046.896s">And</a> we had previously established subcommittees for the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7050.559s">And</a> so I went through, I did trade some information with Member Intoppa and also went back to all of the information I had about the formation of the subcommittees at the beginning of the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7065.549s">And</a> I'm putting forward a recommendation on how the subcommittees will look going forward for the committee's consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7075.692s">Um,</a> and just so you know, I didn't just simply assume that member and Tapa was, um, interested in the same things that member McLaughlin was, although there was like a shocking amount of overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7084.676s">So</a> that was nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7085.977s">Um,</a> but there were other sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7088.238s">You</a> know, there are other sort of things that were happening, um, in terms of people's requests, um, the first time around that we were able to sort of shuffle around in this, um, uh, in this revised, um, subcommittee structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7099.924s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7101.194s">It</a> is in your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7102.835s">It</a> includes the behavioral health and special education subcommittee, buildings and grounds, curriculum, instruction, assessment, and accountability, diversity, equity, and inclusion, family engagement and communication, rules and policy, strategic and capital planning, superintendent evaluation, and last but not least, and we'll talk about this in just a little bit, the ad hoc committee handbook and evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7128.552s">Is</a> there, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7129.761s">are</a> there any questions or any motions on the floor?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7136.184s">Motion</a> approved by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7139.266s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7139.606s">Seconded</a> by Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7143.908s">Miss</a> Branley, Member Branley? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7146.149s">Can</a> I just ask a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7155.474s">Sure,</a> I'm happy to read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7158.531s">So</a> the behavioral health.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7167.858s">That</a> would be a great idea, but one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7173.683s">Um,</a> well, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7175.644s">While</a> that happens, I will, um, let people know who the chairs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7178.406s">Um,</a> behavioral health and special education chaired by member Rousseau buildings and grounds chaired by member Bramley curriculum, instruction, assessment, and accountability by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7189.102s">Diversity,</a> equity, inclusion by member of a pot a family engagement and communication by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7193.743s">Rules</a> and policy by member. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7195.123s">So,</a> strategic and capital planning by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7199.104s">Superintendent</a> evaluation by member of a pot a, and then the ad hoc committee handbook evaluation process by members. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7206.166s">Dr.</a> Cushing, are you able to pull it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7209.966s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7210.707s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7215.217s">Um,</a> so we did have a motion on the floor by members. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7217.518s">So,</a> and I believe a second by member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7221.42s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7222.54s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7247.725s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7276.351s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7277.912s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7281.234s">These</a> subcommittees will be updated on the Medford Public Schools website now that we have taken this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7287.078s">So</a> you can look for that information there in the coming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7291.501s">Once</a> updated, all of our information is on the website anyway, but you'll be able to see the subcommittees there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7300.847s">Item</a> 2024-19, also offered by myself, which is a recommendation to appoint the School Building Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7306.172s">provide</a> an update about the Medford High School Building Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7311.616s">So</a> Dr. Cushing, I have some slides that I would love to be able to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7316.16s">If</a> you can allow me to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7323.226s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7325.768s">So</a> what I wanted to do tonight was two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7329.751s">Let</a> me know if you can see my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7333.614s">Can</a> you see that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7339.21s">What</a> I did want to do tonight was a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7341.212s">I</a> wanted to provide the committee an update on where we are and also the community, because I know there's a lot of interest in this process to form a committee to lead forward on our bid for a re-envisioned Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7362.108s">So</a> I thought I would provide a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7366.82s">Given</a> pieces of this presentation to various. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7370.783s">uh,</a> internal groups, um, over the course of the last couple of weeks, um, when people have asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7375.106s">So</a> I've just been trying to start to pull together something that, um, we can use as we're talking to people about what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7380.609s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7381.51s">As</a> you may recall, um, we are required to create a building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7386.033s">Um,</a> and there's a particular set of folks who are required to be on the committee earlier that, um, earlier this year in February, we passed a resolution that appointed me the chair of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7398.281s">identify</a> the people who would be on the committee and put out a call for application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7402.363s">So</a> we'll get to that in good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7406.406s">But</a> the other thing we did during that meeting was talk about what were our goals for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7412.59s">And</a> I think it's worth restating as soon as I can clear some alerts out of my way here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7418.534s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7420.395s">So</a> plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7424.562s">on</a> the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational, nine to 12 education, nine to 12 athletics, Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools Programming, Early Childhood Education, including but not limited to Medford Early Education Program, which is NEAP and Kids Corner, as well as our transition program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7443.388s">Item</a> number two was to consider whether placement of the Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford High Campus would provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7453.092s">Item</a> number three, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7454.617s">is</a> to ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback at appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7464.987s">Number</a> four, listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for students in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7472.974s">Item</a> number five, create plans for a building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7479.109s">any</a> CHPS and LEED version five certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7487.275s">And</a> finally moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the quote new building as quickly as is feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7497.102s">So</a> where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7499.644s">The</a> process of going through and building with MSBA is actually a five to seven year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7508.378s">There's</a> a very defined set of steps that we have to strictly adhere to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7512.64s">That's</a> the graphic you see on the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7515.041s">And</a> at each step, you have to consider that there's a gate that gives us an invitation to the next step in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7524.386s">And</a> we have to sort of go through whatever and meet the requirements that MSBA lays out for each phase in the process in order to be invited to the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7535.703s">Um,</a> so we are some way, some ways away from shovels in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7539.165s">Um,</a> but the one thing I wanted to make sure people are aware of is, um, we are, we are here where the star is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7547.289s">And</a> that, and that, that is to say that we are out, we are not even in the process just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7553.251s">So</a> our eligibility period starts on May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7557.054s">That</a> is when our clock starts ticking for eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7560.615s">And</a> I'll talk a little bit about what happens in the eligibility phase in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7563.795s">But</a> MSBA sort of staggers the start times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7567.116s">I'm</a> sure that is important on their side in terms of getting brand new projects up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7572.937s">That</a> is very labor intensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7575.238s">So</a> there's some staggering that happens in terms of those invitations going out and when they actually begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7581.819s">So</a> our start date is May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7583.6s">So</a> we are still ahead of that start date. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7587.575s">Um,</a> eligibility period starting on May 1st, um, has to be conclude concluded within 270 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7595.437s">And</a> there's a whole series of things that are required, um, for us to deliver in order to be considered as like compliance with our eligibility period deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7606.24s">This</a> phase of the project is really the phase where the district has to describe what it does in the building and what it plans to do in a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7616.25s">This</a> is where we talk about how big is our population? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7619.372s">What</a> is the growth of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7621.213s">This</a> is where all of that sort of city-side, school-side planning happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7627.696s">And</a> then from here, we start to engage with the construction professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7633.599s">So</a> then we can bring on an owner's project manager, and then we can bring on the designers to do the feasibility study, and on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7640.302s">But</a> until we finish this eligibility phase, none of those things can begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7646.483s">What</a> you may also remember is that back in February, we asked the administration to get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7653.406s">And</a> there's a tremendous amount of work that has to happen in the eligibility phase that uniquely the administration really has to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7663.569s">So</a> it's things like counting math classrooms and describing any changes to the educational process that they're envisioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7675.011s">that</a> would have an impact on space considerations, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7679.332s">So</a> this phase, we have asked the administration to get started and they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7684.174s">We</a> have been working very diligently really since February. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7688.616s">And</a> so I just want to give you a quick rundown of what's happening for each of these five deliverables in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7693.317s">So</a> the initial compliance certification, it's basically a legal agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7697.819s">Our</a> attorney has reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7699.039s">I've</a> reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7699.639s">We've</a> all reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7700.42s">We're</a> ready to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7702.155s">As</a> soon as MSBA sends it to us, which will happen in a few weeks, we're ready to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7707.019s">And</a> we have been since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7708.22s">So</a> check one of five off the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7712.203s">The</a> second thing is to form the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7715.506s">We</a> actually will do this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7717.227s">So</a> the school committee has to establish a committee that oversees the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7722.551s">There</a> are some requirements about who must be on the committee, but the vast majority of how we form that committee is entirely up to this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7730.217s">And</a> much of this was laid out <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7732.456s">um,</a> resolution that put out the calls for applications, um, back in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7739.699s">Um,</a> item number three, their educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7742.02s">There's</a> three, there's two parts of this for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7744.621s">Um,</a> the first is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7746.402s">The,</a> the true educational profile. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7748.183s">So</a> it talks about like, what do we do in our building today and how do we envision it will happen in the new building? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7754.875s">And</a> for us, this includes much, much more than just what happens in the nine to 12 space, because there's so much more that happens in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7763.957s">MSBA</a> has asked us and has authorized us because our statement of interest outlined that this building is more than just a high school, that we consider and think about things like our pre-K programs, the Medford Family Network, and then, you know, again, possible integration of Curtis Tufts in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7784.208s">on</a> to the campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7785.969s">So</a> just a quick status for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7788.17s">The</a> drafting of this is in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7790.612s">Our</a> current state questions, so all the questions about what happens today and how many classrooms exist and how many spaces, all of that is completed and it's in review by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7801.918s">So</a> that'll be in good shape for the building committee when they are ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7806.58s">The</a> future state questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7808.597s">are</a> also sort of in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7810.959s">There's</a> a lot of discussion happening there and that discussion is continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7816.022s">We</a> do anticipate that some of those discussions really are sort of beyond the purview of the building committee, but really more about the educational work happening in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7826.468s">And</a> so those things will come before the school committee in various forms for consideration in the coming weeks and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7834.193s">So</a> I would anticipate some of those reports coming forward between now and the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7839.96s">The</a> other piece of the educational profile for us is our chapter 74 viability. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7844.282s">So</a> that handles all of our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7848.544s">There's</a> a separate set of deliverables required for each of our programs, which includes talking about our demand and our capacity and any plans we have for changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7861.67s">So</a> those changes could include things like <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7865.682s">creating</a> additional capacity for shops that are oversubscribed or where there's a huge wait list that we deal with on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7875.345s">It</a> could also include our ability to say there's a shop and a vocational program that we don't have today because we lack the space to do so, but it fits in our strategic priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7888.329s">So</a> we have the options there from a chapter 74 perspective to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7893.769s">growth</a> of our growing vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7897.112s">And</a> this is, I think, another place where you'll see some information come forward to you from the administration as they think about what those programs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7906.879s">And</a> the MSVA has lots of rules and regulations around what they will consider to be a program that they will expand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7916.266s">So</a> for example, if we came forward and we said that we wanted to pursue <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7924.143s">a</a> new chapter 74 program, they would ask us to substantiate the demand here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7930.646s">They</a> would ask us to talk about where those programs are offered in our surrounding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7936.128s">And</a> they would also ask us to describe to them how our expansion in that space <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7943.157s">would</a> fit with the regional blueprints for the labor market in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7948.123s">So</a> it's not just like we want to do this, it's we want to do this, we have the demand for it, and the area that you live in actually also has demand for this kind of vocational program to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7962.797s">So</a> this is like maybe a more concrete example of some of the things that the school committee might see coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7968.523s">So</a> we talk a lot about and I'll just use electrical for a minute that that shop is at capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7975.61s">So</a> 1 question and consideration we have is does the does the demand and the capacity support. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7982.762s">an</a> expansion of that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7985.783s">And</a> if so, this committee will have to weigh in and say, yes, we agree that that is something we wanna pursue from an educational perspective, and then it can go into our eligibility phase deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7997.368s">Because</a> obviously, even if we have the space, creating expanded opportunities in the vocational program does mean a commitment to supplies and teachers and all of the things that make a good, solid vocational program tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8011.173s">So</a> that's all coming, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8013.058s">all</a> of that work has been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8014.819s">Um,</a> the superintendent's team has been meeting very diligently to, um, put all that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8020.102s">The</a> other piece that we'll have to do, um, from a, from an educational profile perspective, um, is work with the city to provide information about our population citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8030.769s">Um,</a> and also provide, um, inputs around plan development, um, projected growth of school aged children, et cetera, because part of what MSBA will do is they will <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8042.41s">Um,</a> they will, they will define what our target enrollment is, and that will guide all of the sort of sizing of the building when we get into that phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8052.853s">So</a> all of this has to be provided by us in this eligibility phase so that they can do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8057.554s">And</a> then ultimately, um, they can report back to us that this is the size of the building that, um, from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8065.676s">And</a> that can, um, drive forward, um, all the design and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8072.162s">The</a> other thing that we have to provide in this phase is a series of documents that outline our current maintenance practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8080.345s">And</a> that includes not just the high school, but our entire district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8084.787s">And</a> it asks questions like, do you have job descriptions for your custodians and maintenance staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8091.089s">And</a> do you regularly recommission buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8094.76s">Um,</a> and, um, how, who, you know, what kind of contractors do you have on board? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8100.362s">Um,</a> that helps support proactive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8102.623s">So</a> there's a whole slew of questions here, um, that we have to answer as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8107.744s">Um,</a> we are well underway drafting, um, this, these answers, um, in addition, um, in working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8115.027s">Um,</a> the superintendent and Dr. Cushing and, um, John McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8118.732s">who</a> is our head of buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8120.233s">So</a> they're working diligently to be ready to provide all this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8124.614s">And</a> much of this is rounding up data that exists sort of across the system and really being able to put it in one place and create a cohesive narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8135.118s">So</a> there's tons and tons of work going on across all of those deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8139.919s">And</a> then the fifth and final step of eligibility, we're not ready for yet, but our mayor and our city council will have to <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8148.871s">help</a> identify how we will pay for the feasibility study as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8154.672s">And</a> the way that the process works from a feasibility study perspective is the city does agree to fund the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8163.114s">And</a> at the point at which we progress through all the various phases of the project, there's a reimbursement that comes back to the city, presuming that we go successfully through all of the MSBA stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8175.337s">We're</a> not ready for funding the feasibility study just yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8179.071s">Um,</a> but that is sort of the, sort of the off ramp from the eligibility phase and into the phase where we start hiring the project team, which really means bringing on the owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8187.833s">And</a> then ultimately bringing on our designers that will do the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8195.615s">As</a> you may remember, we approved that there would be 15 voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8200.896s">Of</a> the committee and a series of non voting members as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8206.784s">And,</a> um, we also put out a call, uh, for additional steps for additional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8213.509s">Um,</a> and we put out a call for applications, um, to appoint nine additional members. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8218.153s">Which</a> includes one school committee member, one city Councilor, and seven open positions, um, for, uh, members of the committee who are residents, um, which include, which may include, um, teachers and staff are meant for public schools who are welcome to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8234.068s">as</a> well as specifically members of the community with architecture, engineering, and construction experience, or experience with large program management and communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8245.256s">So</a> we have a really active community who was really, really excited about this prospect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8252.881s">We</a> got 104 applications for nine member slots. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8258.365s">The</a> 104 applications included two school committee members, two city Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8263.72s">eight</a> MHS staff members, and then 92 other members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8268.283s">Our</a> candidates are both diverse and qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8276.928s">So</a> we have had lots of many, many, many hours of reading to understand who the folks were that were applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8284.953s">Our</a> demographics from an applicant perspective, 82% of those who applied were current or future parents of MHS students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8293.643s">16%</a> were people of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8295.504s">There</a> were nine members of the disability community and there were nine members of the LGBTQIA community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8302.227s">From</a> a relevant experience perspective, 62% of the applicants had architecture, design, engineering, or other construction experience, which is a huge number. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8311.811s">66%</a> had large program communications experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8316.873s">And</a> then there were many applicants who were members of a whole variety of boards and commissions across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8322.833s">So</a> that was our applicant pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8325.354s">Um,</a> and, um, as we, um, thought about, as you may remember, um, the superintendent, the mayor and I, um, got together and we have, we've spent many hours, um, combing through 104 applications to really try to create a committee that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8341.558s">Um,</a> is representative of Medford, um, and, um, uh, sort of meets the needs of what we outlined in terms of the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8349.74s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8350.615s">Our</a> recommendation tonight, and I'll come back to this slide in just a second, but our recommendation tonight is that we agree to, we vote to appoint member Olapade as our school committee member, Emily Lazzaro as our city council member, community members, including Libby Brown, Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, who is also a staff member at MHS, Brian Hilliard, Tracy Keene, Nicole Morell, and Luke Prisner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8378.553s">And</a> then I'm also going to request that you all vote on appointing an additional non-voting member of the committee to appoint member Rousseau as a non-voting member of the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8392.885s">The</a> committee is subject to approval by MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8396.528s">So</a> there may be changes that have to come once the MSBA gets our submission for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8403.734s">There</a> may be some changes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8406.111s">that</a> they might require, but my conversations with them so far have outlined that we have a lot of broad latitude and that everything that we're putting forward is consistent with what they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8420.362s">Our</a> school building committee selection that we've put forward, we think represents Medford's incredible diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8431.01s">So</a> 89% of our <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8435.899s">of</a> our recommended appointees are current or future members of MHS students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8446.847s">55%</a> identify as female with 45% identifying as male. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8450.009s">33%</a> are people of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8452.17s">9%</a> are members of the disability community and 22% are members of the LGBTQIA plus community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8459.375s">So</a> I'm gonna leave this up for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8465.677s">but</a> I believe that my recommendation would be that we take two votes tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8470.221s">One</a> to appoint the voting members as described here, and then a second to appoint an additional non-voting member and member or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8479.588s">So</a> I will stop there, but I'll leave this slide up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8481.97s">So</a> Mayor, did you want to take over or do you want me to continue?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8628.152s">And</a> I think your point, I just wanted to help people understand sort of what comes next. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8636.015s">So</a> currently we will publish the profiles of all the folks who are appointed to the committee on the school building committee website, which is in construction right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8644.938s">And</a> the committee will meet for the first time before May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8649.599s">They</a> have to be, the entire committee has to be trained because they will all be subject to the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8655.161s">All</a> of our meetings will be conducted in public as are all of our school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8660.062s">The</a> very first things that the committee is going to need to do is establish <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8664.569s">operating</a> ground rules for the school committee, the school building committee, and specifically to develop the communications and public engagement strategies that will help inform the enrollment profile and the operating structures in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8677.552s">So</a> part of the first jobs of the committee is really to say, how will we engage the community before we even get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8685.773s">I</a> do plan to send a note, everybody who applied and encourage them to let us know <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8691.773s">what</a> their particular interests are so that as we are scheduling meetings that might be topically relevant to certain folks that we can reach out to them proactively and invite them to join us at the meetings because we do want to hear from qualified people in the community whether they're on the committee or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8708.349s">So</a> all of that is to come in terms of what we plan to do and then we will also report to the school committee in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8715.7s">Um,</a> about what those communication strategies are, but part of that communication and outreach strategy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8721.942s">Um,</a> not just to say, like, how will we operate and how will we engage the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8726.583s">Um,</a> but they'll specific will specifically take an action item to talk about proper engagement of all of our boards and commissions across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8734.005s">Um,</a> and how best to work with, um, various, um, you know, sort of special interest groups across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8743.243s">Um,</a> and make sure they are brought into meetings where the, where topically it makes sense for them to be involved, um, because all of that public input and engagement is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8754.607s">Um,</a> member Branley, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8767.732s">That's</a> a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8768.792s">Um,</a> they. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8770.779s">they</a> vary widely depending on how big of a building and how many students and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8776.301s">But,</a> um, I have been told to think in the range of two to two and a half million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8782.744s">Um,</a> but that is all work that we still have to do, um, to get to the point of, um, having good numbers in that space.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8805.977s">So</a> at some point further in the process, MSBA will establish what our reimbursement rates are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8812.52s">And</a> if we successfully move through all the phases of the project, they will reimburse the feasibility study at that reimbursement rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8823.926s">So</a> if they say your reimbursement rate is 50%, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8827.011s">then</a> we can expect them to reimburse us at the, you know, as sort of successful conclusion for the feasibility study at that 50% rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8835.035s">Um,</a> so it will be commensurate with the reimbursement rate that is established by the board.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8862.435s">So</a> my recommendation was for a number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8867.437s">One</a> is that there were two members of the school committee who applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8871.679s">Only</a> one can be a voting member. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8873.66s">But</a> I feel like as I looked across the committee, there's a handful of things that I think are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8881.164s">member,</a> so is the most senior member of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8883.526s">So</a> he has more history than any of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8886.048s">Um,</a> but he also has, um, a deep understanding of, uh, running and being part of a committee that is compliant with open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8894.755s">And,</a> um, I think that's really important, um, as well as, um, really thinking about trying to make, uh, the ability of this committee, um, to sort of be part of the process as broad as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8906.524s">So</a> that's my recommendation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8974.816s">Yeah,</a> that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8977.275s">Yes,</a> there will be a number of advisory committees and part of the committee, the school building committee forming and establishing its communication strategies will also include sort of that rounded take instead of just like our take on what those advisory committees could and should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8998.624s">So</a> I want to bring all of these members together to have that dialogue so that we're hearing from all of them <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9006.197s">what</a> they're seeing that they need and recommend, because these are all folks that are incredibly qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9012.62s">There</a> are folks on the committee who are very familiar with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9016.742s">They're</a> architects on MSBA projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9019.724s">They're</a> involved in sustainability and K-12 education. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9022.865s">It's</a> a very, very amazing and impressive group. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9026.567s">And</a> so I think as the committee begins to meet, it will do a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9030.97s">It'll</a> identify those advisory committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9033.872s">Um,</a> it will also, um, identify, um, whether we collectively believe that we need a vice chair of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9040.976s">So</a> I think that's really a question that's best answered once we know what all the other structures are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9046.359s">So</a> all of that will sort of be decided by this committee, um, as they get together and get to know each other and we get to know each other's strengths and how we're going to organize.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9160.099s">Yeah,</a> thank you, Mr. Guillen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9161.62s">Totally</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9163.542s">And</a> one of the things that has to happen, you know, as we get all of this, I'll say paperwork in place, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9172.787s">The</a> MSBA will tell us how much space is allowable for various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9177.189s">They</a> have lots of rules and, you know, and to be perfectly honest, their rules around the vocational programming are improving, but they have always disadvantaged vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9188.976s">And</a> we know that, and people are very aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9192.318s">And</a> so when we talk about bringing on experts to lead the feasibility study, one of the things that happens in that feasibility study space is lots of staff-oriented vision sessions that get to the heart of all of the things that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9212.844s">So</a> I anticipate a much broader inclusion of folks who work in Medford High School in that phase, because those are the folks <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9221.906s">who</a> will be describing sort of what the options are and what the possibilities might become. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9226.908s">So</a> when we get there, there will be educator-specific vision sessions that our architects and our owners, project manager, et cetera, will hold on our behalf, specifically to make sure that we are hearing from all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9243.275s">But</a> I think at any time, I've told Principal Cabral, I'm happy to come in and chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9250.379s">with</a> her staff anytime that you all would like to hear from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9255.78s">And</a> you all can feel free to reach out to me at any time if you have questions or you'd like to see, you know, you have an idea or a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9264.262s">And</a> the last thing I'll say is that our meetings will be open to the public just like these meetings are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9268.303s">So</a> we would love to have you all join us at those meetings as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9568.348s">Mayor,</a> I'd like to also make the motion that Member Olapade and Emily Lazzaro are appointed as voting members pursuant to our original motion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9619.033s">And</a> I'd also like to make a motion that Member Ruseau is added as a non-voting member of the committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9762.176s">MSBA</a> is not going to weigh in on the size of our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9765.818s">Our</a> committee is also already very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9768.66s">With</a> that said, I think if we want to add two additional non-voting members, I think that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9776.064s">I</a> would not call them alternates though, because that has a whole different connotation and we really haven't even talked about what that might mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9783.229s">So</a> I'm happy to amend the motion to say that we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9788.51s">Ad</a> member Rousseau is a non-voting member and that there will be two additional non-voting members brought forward to this committee for approval at the next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9952.13s">Mayor,</a> can I just say congratulations and thank you in advance for your service to the people that we've just appointed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9958.846s">Um,</a> and to let everybody know that I will be in touch, um, after tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10021.319s">I</a> think that depends on, at least for me, that depends on what you all come up with in terms of, like, what you think the process should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10030.741s">And</a> if you recommend that, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10033.321s">And</a> if not, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10034.721s">I</a> would be happy to hear whatever that recommendation is.<h2><a href="../2024-04-04_rfgWV65I8WM/2024-04-04_rfgWV65I8WM.html">MSC Budget COW Meeting #2</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1349.087s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1350.248s">Thank</a> you, Jerry, for all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1353.85s">I</a> had a couple of questions, but before I ask my questions, I just wanted to reiterate, I know we have a big audience here and we have a lot of new members, so I just wanted to reiterate our typical process, which is our budget is a two-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1368.418s">So</a> our budget is first made up of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1373.658s">information</a> about what our request to the municipality is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1377.139s">And</a> that number I think is sort of coming out of what I'm hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1381.84s">And</a> I'll talk about that in just a minute once I get some clarifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1384.461s">But</a> the first thing the school committee does is tell the municipal government what we believe we need to educate children, maximize outcomes and run the school district responsibly next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1396.923s">So</a> that's one vote that we typically take. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1400.748s">The</a> second vote that we typically take is a reconciliation vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1406.335s">So</a> essentially, if there is a discrepancy between what we have requested from the municipality and what the municipality allocates to us in the single line item allocation to our operating budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1419.551s">then</a> it is incumbent on the school committee to operate within that allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1423.757s">So</a> if there is a discrepancy, we then have to identify how do we get from what our request is to how we will actually go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1431.007s">So</a> that's our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1433.33s">I</a> think what I'm seeing in terms of the timeline is that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1436.815s">We</a> certainly could be in a position to take a vote about our request to the municipality as early as May 6, but we could also do that on May 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1448.529s">And</a> then our final vote has typically been much, much later in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1455.197s">that</a> reconciliation vote, but doesn't have to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1458.038s">So</a> it is, I think it is possible we could do that even as early as May 13th as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1463.881s">Although</a> if the council hasn't started their conversation around the budget and there is still like movement happening around the city's budget overall, like we may not want to take that reconciliation vote in the event that there is a gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1478.166s">So,</a> and I think we know, and we've been informed by the city CFO that there will be a gap because the initial allocation for the school district, according to the city CFO is $73,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1489.293s">Last</a> year, our allocation was $71,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1490.934s">It's</a> a little bit more complicated than that because we were using $2.8 million <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1502.541s">on</a> operating expenses from our ESSER budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1507.004s">And</a> that was necessary last year because the operating budget couldn't support the operating needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1512.647s">So</a> it was a conscious decision, as were all the decisions that we've made about ESSER spending and are being made across the country and have been for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1522.093s">So</a> people are, you know, while you don't want to use one-time funds to <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1528.217s">support</a> things that have ongoing expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1531.618s">ESSER</a> afforded districts an opportunity to say, what do our kids need? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1537.58s">And</a> in a place where 80 to 85% of the activity and the spending is on humans to educate kids, it's inevitable that that spending would also require people who are really more considered part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1553.924s">I</a> did have a couple of questions because I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how some of these groups, these buckets break down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1561.826s">Jerry,</a> there was a slide that you showed before the ESSER slide that tallied up to 1.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1569.308s">Can</a> you just bring that slide up again for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1588.134s">Did</a> we lose Jerry?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1595.356s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1596.356s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1597.997s">I</a> was wondering if you could bring back up the slide that came before the ESSER slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1602.978s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1627.091s">I</a> can't see anything just yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1637.438s">No,</a> not yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1661.923s">Coming</a> now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1664.345s">Ah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1665.566s">OK,</a> so those are the underfunded accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1667.527s">And</a> these are <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1677.196s">Okay,</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1677.956s">So</a> these are underfunded accounts and it seems like there's maybe some overlap here with some of the other slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1684.941s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1685.581s">Like</a> when I think about substitute teachers, I think about that ESSER bucket because that is where the substitute teachers were put last year in order to balance our budget last year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1709.446s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1747.772s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1748.152s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1748.433s">That's</a> helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1750.765s">And</a> then on your next slide about ESSER conversion, when I look at this list, I think there are at least some number of these positions that are absolutely not discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1766.598s">So</a> I think specifically about the newcomers program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1770.1s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1771.241s">We</a> can't not spend that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1773.163s">Are</a> there other of these 21.2 staff people that are in what is more likely a non-discretionary bucket rather than a bucket where we could operate the district, not that we should, but we could operate the district without that line item?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2176.272s">Sure,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2178.374s">And</a> then can you look at, can you go to the new spending page, the $1.4 million page? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2188.291s">So</a> again, some of this is not optional, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2193.992s">Like</a> our tuition increase is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2199.853s">And</a> our NEASC funding is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2202.574s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2247.082s">So</a> you're saying the Chromebook refresh is the one that you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2250.563s">Or</a> are you also talking about- Yeah, and the Apple refresh.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2304.406s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2305.487s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2305.747s">And</a> I think the, you know, I guess Medford has always treated those things as capital, but when you talk about Chromebooks in the same vein as textbooks, like they're, they really aren't capital expenses anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2319.115s">They're</a> like expenses that they're it's equipment that depreciates every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2324.719s">typical</a> organization like you would you would handle that depreciation in your operating budget so I mean ideally what districts should be doing is having a an amount of money in the budget every year so that there's a cycle and we don't have these big massive changes that have to happen where we have to replace every Chromebook at the same time but instead in some sort of a <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2346.752s">like</a> a rolling function. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2349.095s">So</a> I will just wrap up my set of questions by saying last year, our budget was $71.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2359.505s">And</a> then we had ESSER of $2.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2362.526s">But</a> if I start from that $71.2 million of last year, and I add up all the things that Jerry described as spending needs, I get $7.5 million for a total of $78,700,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2375.25s">And</a> that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2385.14s">a</a> big distance away from $73.5 million that was preliminarily provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2394.544s">And</a> I also wanna point out that the amount preliminarily provided to us is a $2.3 million increase, which actually doesn't even account for- 3.2, opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2404.149s">You</a> said 2.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2411.545s">3.2,</a> okay, so that barely covers our contractual obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2417.869s">73.5</a> minus 71.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2422.612s">I</a> have 2.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2436.135s">3.2%,</a> is that what you mean, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2437.156s">Yes,</a> 3.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2437.317s">I'm</a> talking about dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2438.118s">So</a> in dollars, that's $2,300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2439.319s">Our</a> contractual obligations are $2.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2453.194s">So</a> thank you, Jerry, for all this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2455.857s">It's</a> very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2457.359s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2808.731s">Mr.</a> Hain, can you repeat the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2810.032s">I'm</a> sorry I missed that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2836.483s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2837.544s">I</a> think that's outlined in the contract, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2843.989s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2844.449s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2845.25s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2981.162s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-03-27_ICamVjB-gmE/2024-03-27_ICamVjB-gmE.html">Strategic and Capital Planning Subcommittee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=0.089s">elect</a> to do something different anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=4.252s">And</a> I think that's an important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=6.253s">The</a> answer to what really is the, you know, what really is the perspective and opinion of those impacted is something that's sort of on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=14.899s">And</a> then I think along the way, we hear lots of questions about like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=21.078s">the</a> policies around how far we will bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=26.461s">I</a> drive by the high school somewhat regularly at about the time kids are already supposed to be in class and there's still like an endless stream of cars dropping kids off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=35.626s">And</a> I do wonder how anybody gets to school on time because the number of cars going in and out, you know, clearly dropping people off is pretty staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=46.472s">which</a> suggests that we're not providing transportation in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=50.494s">So</a> I think the goal is just for us to think about what kind of survey we could provide that would help us start to get some answers grounded in the people who use the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=63.963s">to</a> really think about what are the problems, whether they're solved by a new contract or they're more immediately solvable, and how do we have some facts to move forward with? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=75.872s">So</a> that was the goal of this whole effort to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=80.196s">But</a> I did see earlier today that the district launched a Smart Routes to School survey, and I was curious if anybody could tell us about that and <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=91.105s">what</a> it's what the questions are and who gets the data and what the goals are because I think that does complicate anything we're going to do here like we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=101.957s">put</a> out to transportation surveys in hot succession and expect that people are not going to be confused by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=108.802s">So</a> when we ultimately get to talking about what goes in the survey and timing, I think that'll be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=114.585s">So</a> I didn't know if anybody could tell us a little bit about what that survey is even all about that went out today.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=151.066s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=152.367s">I</a> literally just saw it as I was signing in and I was like, yeah, I
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=250.103s">Okay,</a> that is super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=252.705s">Thank</a> you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=254.687s">So</a> I thought what we could do today is use the time that we have to start to <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=261.94s">brainstorm</a> and think about, like, sort of the questions that we have that we would want to have vetted by this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=270.222s">And</a> to the extent that we can, you know, craft any questions that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=273.923s">And</a> then perhaps Megan and I can work offline to sort of flesh out a draft to bring back to this group at a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=284.405s">And</a> so I have a literal blank piece of paper here that I'm happy to share and we can walk through and just do some brainstorming until it can sort of evolve into something a little bit more formalized, if that works for the group, yeah? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=302.356s">Okay,</a> I'm gonna share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=311.002s">Okay,</a> you all see my screen?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=315.319s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=319.3s">Okay,</a> so I think, you know, sort of one thing that we probably want to be clear about is our questions to answer via the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=332.103s">And</a> then the other thing is, you know, what survey questions are we thinking we'll ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=342.354s">My</a> typing always goes downhill when I'm sharing my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=352.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=354.564s">So</a> I would be happy to hear from any of you if you, I have some thoughts, but I will yield my thoughts to the group if anybody has anything they want to throw out there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=504.978s">good</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=505.678s">And</a> I think the other thing on my mind is we need to, I think in terms of like how we get responses, we need to know like at baseline, each person who's answering the survey, how did they get to school today? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=524.662s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=528.001s">does</a> that meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=530.202s">And</a> if it doesn't, what is it that they would identify as the thing that would meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=536.745s">So</a> as an example, my ninth grader walks to school and that meets my needs because we live less than a half a mile from the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=549.002s">I</a> might feel differently if my ninth grader walked to school, but we live two miles from the high school, which technically means she's supposed to walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=559.087s">And</a> I might say in that case, like I, my kid walks to school, but it does not meet my needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=564.329s">And</a> I would like the district to provide transportation so that she doesn't have to walk two miles to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=570.011s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=570.632s">So</a> I think like understanding sort of how, how it works today for the respondents and <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=578.928s">whether</a> that meets their needs or not, and if it doesn't, like what would, I think is an important way to think about how we want to drive out these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=592.536s">And</a> I think it maybe is both of those things, member Reinfeld, like maybe it is like, is it that I need the district to do something different or I need to do something different, like what, you know, is it that, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=609.312s">there's</a> some barrier that's not allowing me to do the thing that I want to do, or is it simply like, I need a yellow bus to come pick up my kid in order for me to say that this meets my needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=619.982s">And</a> I think we're going to get a whole bunch of different answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=622.704s">But</a> when it relates to students, the high school students in particular, I think one question I would want to dial in on is, if they are <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=634.202s">using</a> a bus to get to school today, what kind of bus are they using? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=637.423s">And</a> like, does that meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=639.603s">And</a> if it doesn't, what would? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=641.984s">Which</a> might help us understand like the MBTA question around like, what are the preferences of the students riding and their families for that matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=658.067s">So</a> that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=662.999s">respond</a> accordingly, you know, and consider like what that means for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=670.085s">I'm</a> going to share this document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=773.576s">Well,</a> I'm not convinced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=774.757s">Well,</a> first of all, I'm not convinced that we would even have access to that data in a raw form, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=781.103s">Like</a> this is, I mean, I suppose we could ask for it, but more than likely we're going to get a report, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=789.051s">That</a> provides, I think we're going to have to ask some, maybe some questions more than, you know, again, because I think we would want to be able to attribute them <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=800.137s">within</a> our own data set, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=806.841s">And</a> Megan, I'm so glad that you're able to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=809.002s">I</a> know that you and I have talked about this a few times like over the course of time, but I'm curious, you know, based on what your office feels in terms of questions about transportation, like what's on your mind as we think about like what people, what information we need to get from people? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=834.073s">Oh,</a> you can't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=836.176s">Hold</a> on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1143.154s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1145.214s">And</a> then Megan, I know the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1149.141s">the</a> questions or the concerns probably are different at different levels, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1153.404s">Like</a> at elementary, I would expect to see lots of different kinds of feedback than at middle school and at high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1167.153s">So</a> I'm curious if there are other questions, like what else do we want to know about in terms of our bus <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1179.807s">ridership,</a> I guess I'll say, or transportation that we haven't talked about so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1185.909s">And</a> one thing that comes to mind is like some explicit questions about late busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1190.711s">And</a> so I know, you know, over the years, that's even been a question at the elementary school level, like there have been a handful of instances where we've provided <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1200.383s">yellow</a> late buses to programs at the elementary school, although it always struck me as like a one-off thing that was sort of happening.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1223.554s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1224.995s">And</a> so, but I think late busing in general is a question that we should probably try to get the answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1232.518s">I</a> know I've heard like, and I sort of wondered about this for forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1237.379s">My</a> middle schooler does afterschool sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1241.921s">They're</a> very scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1243.141s">They're</a> totally predictable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1244.462s">They</a> start after the late bus leaves the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1247.891s">Like,</a> it feels a little bit insane that we would have a school sponsored activity and we would intentionally started after transportation options exist for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1261.903s">So</a> that's, you know, I think when I think of the late bus, I think of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1266.447s">Like</a> my kids, because when they're in middle school, they ride past the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1271.048s">They</a> report about overcrowding on days where there's middle school athletes going from the middle school to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1279.21s">I</a> hear the same thing about the library, which is a hot spot for middle school dating, which always makes me giggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1287.893s">So</a> there's like sort of hot spots around the city that, you know, sort of flare up at different times of the day that I think are worth sort of pursuing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1298.028s">And</a> this, I see somebody from, is that Peter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1301.833s">Is</a> that you with your hand in the air?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1505.026s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1838.989s">Yeah,</a> I think in my mind, if we can craft the questions correctly, like we can ask people about what they do today and is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1851.016s">Is</a> it their preference? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1852.497s">And</a> if it's not, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1855.239s">So</a> that we can acknowledge that not everybody has the same, my mom drives by the high school every day and she's gonna drop me off and that's my preferred way to get there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1868.108s">I'm</a> fine with that and if you sent a yellow bus to my driveway, I wouldn't take it because I'm gonna get in my mom's car and she's gonna drop me off, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1877.675s">Versus</a> like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1880.049s">I</a> don't have a parent that can drop me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1882.772s">And</a> so I walk a mile to school every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1884.433s">Like,</a> I think those are different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1886.875s">And</a> I think individually, like, right, it's impossible to make everybody happy, but I think if you can get enough response to the survey, so back to outreach, if you can get enough response to the survey, you can see trend and you can see like sort of global preferences, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1907.952s">and</a> that data might be useful in order for us to be able to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1914.468s">you</a> know what, like the high school kids have no issues at all with the MBTA buses bringing them to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1920.572s">What</a> they care about is that they're late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1922.313s">For</a> example, like maybe they care, maybe they don't care what the bus looks like, but they care that they can get to school on time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1928.857s">And</a> so I'm fine with the, I'm fine with the MBTA, but it makes me late every day.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1938.246s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1939.027s">So</a> I think there's like a lot of different like, you know, when you talk about like what works for people, like what works for people works for them and not necessarily for anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1949.015s">But</a> I mean, there is a finite number of versions of what exists versus what we would like it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1957.722s">And</a> I think we could see if we can get enough participation, like I think we could see <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1964.691s">something</a> that informs like, are we trying to expand the number of buses we have and by how many, for example, or by none? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1973.973s">Like</a> maybe the survey says like none is the right answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1976.693s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1978.493s">Peter,</a> did you have your hand in the air?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2199.12s">I</a> think the other thing that I hear about <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2204.605s">often</a> well and usually like at the beginning of the year is that there are times where our reliance on MBTA buses is like misaligned with what service they're going to provide right so like when we. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2219.323s">When</a> we start school in August right like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2223.76s">It's</a> like, oh, we don't have service those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2225.982s">Sorry,</a> guys, get yourselves to school some other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2229.704s">So</a> I think the other sort of thing I'm interested, I think my other interest in doing the survey is to be able to present like a really full picture of transportation in the district and <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2245.399s">you</a> know, like dispel the fiction, right, wherever it exists and describe like what we do and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2253.222s">So</a> for example, like I'm under the impression, I could be totally wrong, that we don't have, we don't have late start snow days because the MBTA buses aren't gonna get our kids to school if we put a two hour delay on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2267.667s">I</a> could be completely wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2268.968s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2272.129s">That's</a> what I've always heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2273.11s">That's</a> what I tell people if they ask me, but we also like I think need to be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2283.526s">sort</a> of like lay out like, here's what we do transportation-wise and why, so that we own our story. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2291.454s">So</a> like Megan, my sort of immediate reaction to you saying like, we know what the problems are, was my thought was like, I don't think anybody knows that you know what the problems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2303.044s">Like,</a> I don't think the community thinks that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2306.407s">Like,</a> I don't think they think we have a handle on it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2311.191s">And</a> that is like, you know, Medford dies hard around being disorganized. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2317.34s">So</a> I think if we have answers to these questions, this is also an opportunity for us to say, here's what the data tells us about this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2324.327s">And</a> like, here's like a level set of what we do and why and like what we're already working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2329.551s">So</a> like, I think you're working on lots of great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2333.495s">I</a> just don't think anybody knows about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2335.977s">And</a> it's always a timing issue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2337.978s">Like,</a> when do you tell people that you're working on something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2341.379s">And</a> I think we have a lot of history around, like, misfiring on that timing question, you know, in all kinds of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2351.043s">But</a> this could be an opportunity for us to say, like, as we go forward, here's what we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2356.105s">And</a> we have a set of recommendations based on the data and our current practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2360.267s">And</a> the recommendation is we're going to change the <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2364.088s">you</a> know, the one mile radius to one and a half miles, or we're going to change the two mile radius to one mile, like whatever those things are that we're going to decide out of this, like this is an opportunity for us to strategically say, like, this is the need, this is what we have, and this is where, this is like, this is what we think we should do over the next X years, and that's how we're going to go forward with a plan around, you know, all things transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2390.848s">I</a> think the other question I have is like how do we wrap in all the transportation like the individualized transportation that the district provides because I think that's an important aspect to all of this is to make sure we understand that piece of it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2409.319s">you</a> know, what the set of questions are around that individualized transportation, whether it's to schools within our district or schools that are out of district, like what, you know, we have to sort of craft some questions about that as well for the impacted individuals who, who take that kind of transportation from the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2430.525s">Megan,</a> did you have a question or a hand up?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2811.658s">Because</a> a lot of this- I think it's about sort of what do you do with the survey afterwards, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2834.875s">Did</a> the students at the Student Advisory Council meeting have other transportation related things to talk about?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2910.798s">Okay,</a> so I think we have a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2914.605s">Well,</a> I think we have a lot of questions to answer in the context of the survey.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3138.056s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3140.637s">We</a> only have a few minutes left and I wanna be mindful of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3143.538s">I</a> think this was like a really, really good discussion and Megan and I can take some work on to craft some questions and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3153.42s">But</a> I think the other question, to your point about outreach, I think we do need to think about, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3159.682s">How</a> do we get participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3160.985s">I</a> think we certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3166.66s">you</a> know, we could think about like the timing of the survey and when it goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3170.423s">Like,</a> are we interested in this going out like in September when we can like send it with like all the other paperwork that goes home and ask people to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3179.069s">Is</a> that a terrible time of year? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3180.53s">So</a> really interested in like what the right timing of this is that would allow us to collect good data and still position us to <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3193.159s">use</a> the data to inform any sort of RFP we need to do for our yellow bus service next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3198.582s">But</a> also think about like, what are the mechanisms where people are the most like, where we are the most likely to be able to convince people to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3213.05s">And</a> how do we, you know, how do we sort of capitalize on high participation kinds of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3223.999s">moments</a> to like get people to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3226.12s">I</a> think students like we have some we have options like you know using their advisory blocks and we can even have like a drawing of some kind right like we could do something that incentives people to reply from a student perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3242.229s">I</a> think that's less less what's the right word less <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3249.46s">motivating</a> maybe to parents who are like, I get 100 emails a day, I'm not going to take the time to do this right for a $5 gift card. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3257.026s">But,</a> you know, are there other reasons why I think there's a swath of families that will be highly motivated to do this, but I am equally concerned that <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3266.733s">we</a> want to hear maybe more from the families who don't fill it out, or at least as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3275.255s">So</a> how do we create a way to get to them too?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3386.565s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3389.106s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3390.027s">It's</a> 531, so we'll wrap this up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3394.589s">If</a> there is anything else that you all are thinking about, just go ahead and shoot me a note. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3400.031s">And</a> then Megan, I will connect with you, and we can find some time to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3403.915s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3404.996s">Get</a> through the next steps here and. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3408.117s">Um,</a> then once we have that, I will be back in touch to schedule another meeting for us to review because the next the thing after that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3416.88s">Will</a> be to bring this to the full committee, which I think we said we would do by June so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3485.816s">I</a> think that makes a lot of sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3520.523s">Good</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3521.363s">I</a> think it can be, but I think if there's data that we can like use and leverage, we can certainly provide that to, it would really be to the folks doing the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3532.188s">So</a> I think they would be interested in like sizing sort of what those needs are from a feasibility perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3538.691s">So</a> I think if we have input that we can provide them, that will be useful, but I assume that they also will have their own <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3546.414s">ways</a> that they recommend sort of getting answers to those questions, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3555.299s">Yeah,</a> yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3557.9s">So</a> yeah, I think probably both is the short answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3562.382s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3563.683s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3564.663s">I</a> heard a motion to adjourn by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3566.544s">Oh,</a> I can second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3569.566s">Seconded</a> by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3571.307s">So</a> I'll do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3572.768s">Member</a> Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3573.828s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3574.769s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3576.746s">Member</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3578.61s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3580.454s">The</a> meeting is adjourned.<h2><a href="../2024-03-19_a6yjvy9bets/2024-03-19_a6yjvy9bets.html">3.18.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4711.297s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4712.838s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5055.865s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Edwin-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5057.005s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5058.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5059.386s">I</a> really want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5062.987s">This</a> is what transparency looks like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5065.768s">So</a> there's lots of choices about how you deal with a shortfall, and sometimes you do it quietly, and sometimes you have to make choices about when to let the committee know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5076.731s">And</a> I think Jerry <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5078.735s">did</a> exactly what we have been wanting and needing, really, since I've been on the committee, to be proactive, to talk to us about what the challenges were, and then to do the work that comes with these kinds of things with such a fluid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5094.864s">And</a> I just wanted to sort of commend Jerry and say this is what the community is looking for when they say they want transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5104.549s">Sometimes</a> transparency is uncomfortable and ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5108.121s">And</a> I think it has been uncomfortable and ugly to hear about a $2 million deficit or $2.5 million deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5115.185s">I</a> do think it's our job as the committee to sort of listen to what our finance people are telling us and let them do the work and assume that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5123.91s">So</a> I was happy to hear a brief update on this last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5128.993s">And</a> I would encourage anybody who is particularly interested in our revolving funds to watch the Committee of the Whole that we had last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5135.357s">It</a> was the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5136.812s">Since</a> I've been on the committee where we actually had a conversation about revolving funds and what they looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5142.537s">There</a> are some absolute concerns in the but in the revolving funds budget, but we are now in a position to talk about them, which we've not been before so. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5152.285s">overall,</a> there, you know, there was a lot of there were lots of comments about that in in our budget meeting committee of the whole last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5158.128s">So</a> if you didn't join us, and I think most people did not, but are interested in like, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5163.13s">And</a> what are those funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5164.751s">It</a> was, I think, very educational and informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5168.592s">And</a> it sort of helped guide us in terms of some of the resolutions you'll see on the agenda later tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5174.155s">But</a> many thanks to Jerry and his hard work, navigating us through this and keep up the transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5181.258s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5181.926s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5182.786s">Member</a> Branley?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5308.133s">Say</a> something. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5309.394s">I</a> think what he's suggesting is that balances <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5316.479s">that</a> are not needed to cover the deficit can be moved forward, not costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5320.88s">Like</a> I did not read what he wrote there in that paragraph as pushing spending out into next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5328.323s">What</a> he's saying is if I'm planning to use $100,000 from a revolving fund and I don't need to, it'll stay in the revolving fund for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5335.925s">So</a> I don't think it's actually a spending issue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5339.626s">Where</a> does it say spending?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5345.828s">Whereas,</a> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, honey. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5347.369s">Second</a> line. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5348.309s">So</a> yeah, I guess that is spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5351.03s">Sorry,</a> I was reading the bottom paragraph, which is more about payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5355.932s">So</a> yeah, there may be something in there that he is projecting into next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5360.114s">But</a> we, we, I think, historically, when we have like big payments for curriculum and things like that, if we can prepay them, we do so sometimes it's not that <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5370.506s">they're</a> due necessarily, but if we have the budget, we pay for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5372.927s">So</a> it could be something like that, but he can better describe that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5672.908s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5675.871s">Two</a> things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5676.371s">The</a> error was a small piece of the reduction from what Jerry first cited to us as his concern and this reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5685.922s">So</a> that was a piece of the problem, not the entirety of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5690.423s">But</a> yeah, this memo is on the floor, and so it's public record, and we can definitely send it to you so that you can have it and see it and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5699.166s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5699.506s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5700.466s">And</a> then I would suggest that if you all haven't watched the Committee of the Whole from last week that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5707.569s">It</a> was just really an interesting look at our enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5711.93s">We</a> talked about our counts of low-income students, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5716.189s">the</a> state's reimbursement is different for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5718.01s">So</a> we talked about all the pieces that sort of make up funding the budget, so to speak, and what those numbers are looking like for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5727.374s">That's</a> all very much still a moving target because the governor made her proposal, the house has to do their proposal, the Senate has to do their... So all those numbers are potentially subject to change, but he took a really thoughtful approach through those initial stages of like, what is the sort <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5745.333s">quote,</a> revenue as, as it were. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5747.093s">And</a> I think that look at the revolving funds is also really enlightening and important because that money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5756.655s">It's</a> intended to be used for very specific things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5759.436s">But</a> he walked us through a whole process of allocating expenses to programs that generate revenue, like the afterschool program, for example, we've never like <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5771.653s">done</a> any sort of facility charge to that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5774.276s">So</a> it looks like that program is very, very, very profitable, but our general fund budget has been paying those expenses for all of eternity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5783.084s">So</a> all the electricity, all the space, all those things are being paid for out of the general fund, and he is actually implementing mechanisms to rightfully allocate <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5793.885s">Things</a> like natural gas and all of those things to programs that are revenue generating so that a we can know what those really cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5802.455s">because</a> I think everyone thinks they know what those programs really cost, but we are not charging back to those programs, so we don't, which I think will be very enlightening and maybe problematic in some cases, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5815.141s">Like</a> when we talk about facility rentals, like we wanna make sure that the money we're bringing in for rentals is actually paying for the expenses that we're incurring, because if it's not, then our general fund budget is paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5825.986s">So</a> he's doing a lot of good work in that space too, and that was all talked about in the committee of the whole, so I think that's another, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5832.202s">really</a> important part of like what I see is like a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5835.987s">reshuffling</a> how expenses are allocated this year that we've never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5840.73s">But</a> it's very timely and important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.363s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.823s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.983s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5865.322s">Um,</a> it's everything from like lost library books to kids corner to rentals before and after school, community, all those things that generate revenue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5907.669s">So</a> when you look at what the budget will ultimately look like, the ins and the outs can't be described to us until he has done some of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5916.611s">So</a> yes, he's actively doing all of this to try to get ready to do that presentation in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5924.172s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7054.059s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7055.901s">Could</a> I just ask that when coffee with the Councilors happens, some communication goes out to high school parents who are not available on Fridays between 8 and 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7066.59s">to</a> ever hear what's being said in those sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7069.012s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7070.233s">I</a> think the PTO has indicated a willingness to help disseminate that information, but I haven't seen it materialize yet, and I don't think it's for lack of asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7080.748s">I'm</a> hoping the Councilors can formalize whatever it is that they're talking about and make sure it's shared a little bit more broadly than the audience who can make themselves available during the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7090.434s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7090.754s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7091.354s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9683.63s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9685.09s">Motion</a> to waive the first reading.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9935.86s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9937.462s">So</a> I just want to offer like a really tactical example of why somebody on the committee knowing what's going on is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9944.331s">So</a> when I chaired the meeting two weeks ago, or whatever that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9949.13s">the</a> entire committee was completely unclear whether we had an absent member, whether we only had six members, whether we had a new member who wasn't yet sworn in and like nobody here until like the very last moments of the meeting was clear about what that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9965.635s">So</a> we recorded a member as absent, which was not true, it turned out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9970.036s">So</a> I think this language makes sense because there is a role for this in our group, but also once we, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9978.208s">adopt</a> it, we should send it to the clerk so that he understands his responsibility to the committee when he swears a member into office. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9986.555s">So</a> he would still swear people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9989.558s">We</a> just need to know what's happening here so that we can conduct business accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9994.442s">So</a> I have a motion on the floor to waive the first reading.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10013.42s">Motion</a> to approve the updated policy as outlined.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11087.905s">Yes,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11089.619s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11092.021s">In</a> addition to emergencies, this is the kind of fund that we will need to rely on to demonstrate to MSBA that we have set aside adequate money for feasibility study, which we will need to do to get out of the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11104.514s">So</a> I am completely for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11107.237s">I</a> think this is part of stabilizing our budgeting process, which we've all been working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11113.111s">And</a> I do hope that council will approve any requests that you send them to put money into the stabilization fund, both for the unexpected and also eventually for the feasibility study for MSBA's process. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11128.317s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11580.622s">approval</a> by member Rousseau second member Graham yeah I just wanted to add that in addition to this the resolution which has been repeated here the district also issued guidance in <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11598.696s">I</a> believe that outlined a specific set of occurrences for which the district had identified that a suspension was both appropriate and in compliance with this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11612.767s">And</a> we're bringing this forward because we are continuing to hear about instances outside of that set of parameters that is both compliant with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11624.849s">And</a> compliant with the like set of reasons outlined by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11630.776s">So</a> I just have a lot of concerns that a this policy was never properly implemented in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11637.203s">The</a> things that were described in terms of funding and the things that needed to happen from a <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11645.503s">from</a> a funding and implementation perspective, none of those things were brought to us and we have to, I think we, I think we're just veering way far away from the intent of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11656.591s">And</a> that is symptomatic of bad implementation and we have to think about how we can recover from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11663.156s">So</a> I want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11666.986s">We</a> can be clear and I think there are some people who want to speak tonight about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11671.689s">From</a> their perspective, but I want to make sure that we are we are really evaluating whether the things that are happening in our buildings are appropriate and consistent with this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11682.852s">And</a> I think it was always our intention to hear from the administration on on multiple occasions about how the implementation was going and I don't think we've really done that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11692.438s">So</a> that I think we need to start to change the dynamic here around this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11697.441s">So</a> we can make sure that a we're funding the supports needed appropriately that came up very specifically in 2021 <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11705.865s">when</a> it became clear that there was no staff or mechanism for an in school suspension which is an alternative to suspending kids out of school, which I think is very viable and used by a lot of districts but we just have never properly like resourced or funded such a thing so it's fine if we don't need that because we don't have reasons for it but <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11727.051s">If</a> we're hearing about students being suspended for things that are outside of our policy, like I think that's definitely a signal that we need to go back to the drawing board on this implementation and make sure that everyone in the district understands the policy and the guidance provided and that we can start to adhere to those things or something can come forward to us for consideration and we can make a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11750.646s">Member</a> Intoppa?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12117.464s">member</a> Graham, can I offer another? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12122.246s">Two</a> things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12122.887s">Is</a> there anybody on zoom who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12125.007s">I</a> thought there might be somebody with a hand in the air.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12131.15s">OK,</a> so I would also like to make an amendment to item. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12138.794s">Number</a> three that maybe it's its own sub bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12144.178s">that</a> describes the number of instances where Medford Public Schools has filed a police report in a related incident to a suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12157.461s">I</a> am super concerned about students with records and charges against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12169.583s">And</a> I wanna make sure that we're doing <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12172.969s">our</a> due diligence to keep the community safe, but that we are not ruining the lives of children in our care who make bad decisions at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12182.916s">So</a> there's definitely a needle to thread there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12185.357s">And</a> I'd like to see us explore an understanding of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12189.74s">In</a> addition, in item number three, is that member member is that the number of
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12206.956s">I</a> would say per student, but I don't know how that data is collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12213.697s">So</a> I don't have like a strong opinion about how we know about the reporting of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12218.839s">I</a> just want to make sure that we are discussing that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12296.568s">I</a> think the historical record is, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12299.929s">Is</a> three years a reasonable amendment on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12302.881s">Yeah,</a> so motion to approve as amended.<h2><a href="../2024-03-14_di3OGRzz05w/2024-03-14_di3OGRzz05w.html">3.13.2024 MSC FY25 Budget Committee of the Whole</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=40.214s">I</a> don't think we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=41.995s">You're</a> muted.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=45.857s">There</a> we are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=55.361s">Member</a> Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=58.436s">Do</a> not see her on just yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=64.398s">I</a> remember joining us right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=100.355s">Seven</a> present, zero absent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=138.235s">Thank</a> you, members. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=138.815s">So</a> Mayor Edward, sorry, Mayor Edouard-Vincent, oh my goodness. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=143.638s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent, would you like to lead us off?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=282.448s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=282.728s">Why</a> don't we let you get started, Jerry? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=286.169s">And</a> then if there are stopping points, why don't you just let us know where those good stopping points are in your presentation, and we can stop and ask questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=517.448s">Mayor,</a> did you want to take over? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=518.549s">Did</a> you want me to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=752.586s">Don't</a> attend our school committee meetings on Mondays, but I was hoping maybe you could just write a report and submit that as an agenda item so that somebody can like read that for the record in our main meeting and I'm going to hold my any you know any. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=768.23s">sort</a> of additional questions and comments until then because this isn't on the agenda for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=772.551s">But</a> since I know that you generally aren't able to join those meetings, I did wanna say thank you for being proactive about telling us because we could easily find ourselves in the situation that Brockton is finding themselves in right now with massive surprises of deficits with everybody asleep at the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=792.977s">So</a> I don't think you should feel embarrassed <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=796.958s">Thank</a> you for being diligent and for informing the committee, because I think that that is what we all want and need. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=805.746s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=806.947s">And</a> then member Ruseau, I think Noah Urasko has joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=811.031s">So</a> if you can add him to the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=813.072s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1202.106s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1203.947s">I</a> will reconnect about scheduling some time with Tracy Novick to do a real deep dive on chapter 70 for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1215.034s">Now</a> that we have a new member on board, we'll get his availability and <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1219.077s">figure</a> out a time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1221.039s">But</a> Jerry, a couple of things that I've been watching in the news is that two points of concern about chapter 70 is one, the rate of inflation that was assigned in the governor's budget, which was like one and a half percent, I wanna say, and people feeling like that's considerably lower than what actual inflation represents. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1243.601s">But</a> the other thing that people are talking about is a pretty substantial reduction in students being considered low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1251.145s">There's</a> actually like a list of communities where the drop was significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1257.748s">And</a> I didn't see us on that list, but I was just curious if you have any insights about how our low income enrollment numbers are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1265.532s">I</a> mean, I know they're sort of attributing it to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1268.493s">mass</a> health redetermination, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1272.577s">But</a> I was just curious what our low income numbers look like, and if we feel like those sound representative of our population, or if we are, if there is a gap there, much like our SNAP gap.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1395.743s">We</a> can't see your screen right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1398.724s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1399.525s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1405.007s">Here</a> it comes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=1545.56s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3043.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3044.308s">I</a> think across the board, we have unequivocally been told in the past that it is absolutely the school committee's authority to set rates for all of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3054.316s">And</a> we have never been presented with a rate card despite asking about it at least annually since I have been on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3062.982s">And</a> so before we <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3065.464s">go</a> too far into the next fiscal year, I would like to see a rate card for our review and approval for all the tuition-bearing parts of this revolving fund, and that would include recommendations about Kids' Corner, the pool, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3083.317s">any</a> sort of preschool programming, NEAP to the extent that community members are paying for it, driver's ed, athletics, like all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3092.603s">I</a> think we have approved athletics once or twice and really to waive tuition during our waive user fees during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3102.069s">But</a> I would like to see a cohesive rate card that also includes our rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3108.953s">our</a> rental rates so that we as a committee can take a vote and be supportive of what we need to generate from a revenue perspective into these accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3121.465s">And</a> I think, you know, Jerry, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3124.989s">obviously</a> you can't do what you weren't even here to do, but we've asked this question multiple times and we have been assured that it's coming, but I think we really do need a fiscal view of these tuitions to say, what do we recommend that they are for FY25? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3146.083s">Like</a> we've already done that with before and after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3148.824s">So</a> I feel comfortable with that, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3151.246s">they're</a> not an exception in any way in terms of how they operate to anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3155.467s">So</a> I'm hoping that that can be on the agenda in the coming month or so, because some of these programs, people will need to start to plan accordingly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3203.374s">I</a> don't have a preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3204.495s">Like</a> if there's an ease, whatever is easiest for the administration to go through and sort of cover all the bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3211.12s">I</a> think whatever we do to set rates for next year, this year is going to be probably really imperfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3218.525s">And</a> next year we can be a little bit more comprehensive about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3222.448s">and</a> say like, is what we did last year, did it work, did it not work, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3227.149s">And</a> then I think we can get on a schedule where we could do rate setting as a single thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3233.311s">But</a> if it takes a while for us to get there, I think that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3237.472s">So</a> I don't have a strong preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3239.772s">I</a> think it's really more question of like, how can the administration be ready for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3247.894s">I</a> had two other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3252.673s">One</a> is, I would like to see a reconciliation of athletic fees to ensure that we are collecting all of our athletic user fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3263.12s">So</a> I would like to know how many students are registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3268.464s">What</a> that means in terms of the anticipated fees, the number of students who are exempted from fees, whether they have like multiple siblings in sports or they play many sports or we are providing financial assistance, I would just like to see an actual accounting of like <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3284.878s">kids</a> doing sports and money collected, and I would like to see whether that number ties out or whether we have a problem collecting our fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3296.263s">I</a> am concerned that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3297.464s">I've</a> heard from lots of people in the community that <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3300.41s">It's</a> really hard to actually pay the school to have their kid participate, but their kids get to participate anyway, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3307.573s">And</a> I would absolutely love for us to be a fee-free school. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3311.855s">But</a> in the meantime, if we're going to charge fees, I want to make sure we're doing it with accuracy and fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3317.717s">And</a> I've not ever been able to see any reporting that sort of gives me that assurances. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3323.459s">I</a> think that would be another thing I'm interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3325.641s">And</a> then I think the other thing that strikes me, and it's honestly been sort of on my mind since long before I was on the school committee, is when we talk about like, and these are small examples, but like lost Chromebooks and lost library books, what is the process for replacing those? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3345.115s">Because</a> anytime I spent a lot of time in the school libraries and what I heard was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3350.891s">Oh,</a> well I keep this money in my petty cash because once it goes into the lost book fee, I can never get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3355.712s">And</a> what I see when I see a line that says there's $30,000 in lost Chromebooks, that's $30,000 in like Chromebooks not available to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3364.954s">And</a> same thing with library books, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3366.834s">Like</a> there's a 20 something thousand dollar balance, which in the library, the used library, the lost library book fund, that means there's $28,000 worth of books not available to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3378.156s">And</a> I think the point of the fund is to replace the lost books and it just doesn't seem like that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3383.801s">So</a> I would also like to delve into like, what are the processes to use those funds and who is responsible for making sure that's happening on a regular basis and in those two particular instances?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3510.771s">Yeah,</a> I completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3512.492s">Well,</a> maybe three years ago now, we asked for that exact audit to be done, and we retained Andy Paquette to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3523.678s">And</a> he did provide a public report <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3531.353s">to</a> us and it did not go into that level of detail, which was disappointing at the time and also sort of the middle of COVID and lots was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3542.809s">I</a> don't know if privately there were <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3547.443s">recommendations</a> made about revenue collection, but as I sat here looking at this, I certainly said some sort of centralization of revenue operations and controls has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3558.094s">All</a> that cash management control strikes me as a risk, and it's great to hear you say you're not overly concerned about any sort of actual fraud happening right now, but <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3570.046s">it's</a> incumbent on us to prevent that. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3571.848s">And</a> I think we need to have good measures to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3574.631s">But</a> also we need to be able to tell people what they owe us and make it easy for people to, to, to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3580.737s">So,</a> you know, like I see stuff all the time and sort of, you know, like field trips, people say like send cash or, you know, please send cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3589.105s">And</a> like, that's, that's part of like revenue collection <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3593.109s">That's</a> a symptom of complicated revenue collection, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3596.77s">So</a> I think we do need to do that, but there may be some findings from that initial report that you can get your hands on as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3620.716s">Yeah,</a> OK, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3623.111s">And</a> then I think the other question I had is whether we're confident that community schools is being charged appropriately for the staff expenses.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3683.615s">Yeah,</a> and that just can't continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3687.177s">We</a> can't continue to pay in excess of what our rentals are providing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3692.6s">It's</a> just not feasible, and it hurts our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3698.282s">And</a> we can't continue to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3702.565s">Thank</a> you so much, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3703.625s">This</a> is super helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=3746.176s">I'm</a> okay to stay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4588.769s">Nope,</a> she's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4592.312s">But</a> member Ruseau, did you wanna ask a question?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4362.562s">From</a> the chair, we actually, Thomas Dalton, our director of communications, was recently able to set up a dedicated link to allow people to make donations to the McGlynn Playground Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4378.761s">And</a> I wonder if there is an opportunity to do something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4383.025s">to</a> allow the community, any community members who are out there who might be listening or who might read our, the superintendent's weekly newsletter to help support the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4393.788s">So</a> I don't know if that's possible, but I would like to make a motion from the chair that we explore whether that's an option and just report back to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4409.651s">So</a> motion by me, seconded by member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4413.224s">roll</a> call.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7246.07s">I</a> have a couple of questions myself, and then there's at least one hand from the community that I wanna take before we wrap this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7254.753s">So</a> my question is just to get clarity at each school is the constraint <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7263.18s">staff</a> or space or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7266.402s">And</a> I'm not clear, like when I look at the distribution of students at the Brooks, we're filling 53% of the need if you take the total in the program, plus the people on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7280.05s">At</a> McGlynn, we're filling 77.6% of the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7281.911s">At</a> Missittuck, we're filling 65% of the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7283.572s">And</a> at the Roberts, we're filling 42% of the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7286.353s">Having</a> said that, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7293.03s">the</a> program at the Brooks is about double everybody else's program, so I'm trying to understand, is it space, is it staff, or is it both for each building? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7302.295s">Can</a> you answer that off the top of your head, or do you need time? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7305.317s">I</a> mean, simply, it's both. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7307.218s">In</a> all buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7308.119s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7308.939s">And</a> so what are the space constraints at the McGlynn, the Misituck, and the Roberts?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7404.988s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7408.349s">So</a> how can, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7410.16s">those</a> same spaces fit twice as many kids at the Brooks?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7503.434s">No,</a> I think it's helpful because I think when you look at these numbers, to me it says, why can't 124 kids be at the McGlynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7511.638s">Why</a> can't they be at Missittuck? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7512.938s">And</a> why can't they be at the Roberts? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7513.979s">Because</a> those wait lists would all be cleared long before those counts reach 124. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7520.281s">So</a> I think the question that I have for you and the administration is, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7527.12s">what</a> can you do to solve the space problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7529.602s">So</a> if you have constraints in buildings, like that are, if you have things that are working in one building and that they're not available to you in another building, what can be done to pull all the principles together and say, how do we create space capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7546.454s">And</a> does that, what would that provide? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7548.495s">Like</a> what kind of capacity would that provide? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7553.177s">I</a> also feel like so I think that's one request that I have of you all is to say, what can you do to solve the space issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7562.061s">If</a> you have the staff and I understand that you have to have both for this to work at all but I would like some clarity about what. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7571.505s">can</a> be done to create more space so that if five people knock on your door tomorrow that you can deploy them and we can start to clear some of these wait lists so I think that's one thing that I have a really big question about and I think the other question that I have for you and you don't need to answer it today is <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7588.326s">What</a> should the capacity of our buildings be when it comes to after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7594.048s">I</a> know it's much less than 550 kids or whatever it is that are in the building I know it's much less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7601.791s">In</a> the past you have talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7604.532s">Um,</a> real like fundamental like building safety concerns that are very different in the afternoons than when you have a building full of adults so there's 100, 100 adults in a school building during the school day at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7620.402s">So</a> if an evacuation is needed, if a medical emergency happens, if, you know, if anything requires people to mobilize, you have lots of options inside the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7629.945s">And</a> I know that you have many less in the afternoon in the afterschool programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7634.066s">And</a> so I understand that the number that we can accommodate in any given building is much less than like the capacity of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7645.129s">I</a> also think your point about the kind of space that is suited for after school is like, I think you did a nice job sort of outlining that but I would actually like you to tell us a little bit more about that because what you and I have talked about and what we have heard over time I think is really important, which, which are things like <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7665.93s">Can</a> you just take classroom space? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7667.73s">It</a> was not that long ago that the administration, none of the people in this room were standing before us telling us if they had more staff, it would be no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7675.732s">The</a> programs could be endlessly big. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7678.092s">And</a> at the time I was like, well, that's exactly what I want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7681.313s">That's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7682.373s">But</a> I think that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7684.433s">And</a> I think you all need to tell us what you recommend so that we can support you and we can set policy about how big these programs can be in these buildings so that <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7696.076s">There's</a> a clear number that we're shooting for because I think what you've said in the past is the Brooks program cannot get bigger, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7703.773s">Is</a> that still true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7706.775s">And</a> I think what you're saying right now is it has to get smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7710.118s">And</a> I think that's a really hard message to dish out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7714.262s">So</a> what I would like to see is some clarity about like, what is that capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7719.446s">And</a> in sort of in tandem with that, if you could get to that capacity number, how many more staff would you need in order to like sort of rise to that capacity level? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7731.497s">I</a> think that would be very helpful information to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7734.38s">The</a> other thing that I think would be helpful to have about the wait list is you transport all of the kids to other programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7741.386s">What</a> percent of the kids on the wait list are in other programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7745.73s">So</a> when you look at this, you think like 106 children at the Brooks do not have afterschool care. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7751.455s">I</a> don't actually believe that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7753.256s">I</a> don't believe people are leaving their kindergartners to fend for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7757.58s">And</a> while we may be the most desirable program, that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7761.241s">And</a> if we had lots of space, we could take everybody and their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7764.883s">But</a> in the meantime, I wanna really understand the gap in the community, which is bigger than just who can fit in our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7775.047s">So</a> I'm hoping you can do some work maybe with our director of data and reporting to present sort of a more evolved picture than this so that we can understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7787.512s">So</a> that when we talk about like pulling for the lottery, we're clear about like what number are you trying to get to now and what number like what number are you even able to increase to if more staff come through the door than you're expecting because I think that's part of the frustration in the community is like people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7806.544s">I</a> think that programs should be growing and you're saying they can't, and I think we need to be like really crystal clear about why that is so that there can be no confusion, it's not to say that anybody will be happy with what you have to say but I think if we can all be on the same page about those realities I think that's the first step to actually sort of solving a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7829.454s">I</a> guess the other question and request I would have for you all is to work with the two middle school principals to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7837.458s">Is</a> there space in their buildings, which the makeup of what happens in middle school, after school is completely different than high school, but is there space in their buildings to help you with capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7849.369s">So,</a> and if there is, again, like what kind of staff would you need to sort of fill that capacity, whatever it might be to sort of demonstrate to us what you think the growth could look like and <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7863.762s">set</a> our expectations about how fast it can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7866.644s">Because</a> I think if we said like, great news, we could take 70 more kids if we opened a program at the Andrews, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7874.687s">I</a> think it's not realistic that all 70 of those kids can come in this year, because you have to have staff, you have to have all the things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7881.89s">But</a> like, what might be reasonable? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7883.651s">I</a> think that's really important for us to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7887.613s">In</a> terms of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7890.134s">the</a> rate for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7892.776s">I</a> am actually not in favor of tying it to a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7898.859s">I</a> think we've done a lot of things for this group in particular that have been out that have operated outside of what we've been able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7908.604s">for</a> staff that are on contract with us through our union partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7914.445s">And</a> what one unit needs and what the next unit needs is often really, really, really different. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7921.087s">And</a> I would hesitate to tie us to a contract who may or may not be experiencing the same kinds of issues that afterschool is when it comes to compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7934.39s">So</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7936.92s">I</a> that's I think a vote we would need to take when we had a little bit more information and I would love to see if this isn't how we choose to go forward with staff comp changes like what would your recommendation be for next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7948.784s">I</a> think I would like to see that before we take it for me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7952.746s">Any</a> votes on how staff rates will change for next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7957.487s">So</a> I think that would be super helpful and then my last I'll say question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7965.857s">is</a> around not for this year, but exploring if there's a way to shift our rate structure for tuition so that increases to the general population joining the program do not also create an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7990.643s">by</a> percentage point essentially for those folks who are receiving financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=7995.747s">So</a> like when I look at this, right, we're charging $11 an hour essentially for before school and we're charging like $8 an hour for after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8004.433s">So</a> to me, I would like to see those after school numbers go to something commensurate with the before school numbers, but I'm not ready to do that now because doing that would hike <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8016.328s">the</a> 50% threshold for those families receiving financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8021.57s">So</a> I would also like to see like is there a way to uncouple this from a percentage point to like a flat dollar amount where there's like different <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8030.27s">different</a> scales for tuition so that we as a committee could say, we're moving the general scale up $3 or whatever it is, but we're making a decision this year not to move this other scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8043.715s">So</a> I don't think we can accomplish that before you need to be able to tell people what the program's gonna cost next year, but I would like to see that in anticipation of this conversation next year so that we can be really thoughtful about <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8059.64s">who</a> we are increasing tuition for and by how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8064.503s">And</a> I think right now, like the increase that you're proposing is really modest. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8068.466s">And</a> so it's also modest for those people on financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8071.769s">But</a> if we are the most desirable program in the community, putting on my like business finance hat, we should be the most expensive, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8082.376s">And</a> I understand that we are not necessarily like here to sort of pull in <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8088.28s">lots</a> of cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8089.221s">That's</a> not what we do as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8091.302s">But</a> I would like to make sure that we can adequately pay for all the things that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8098.747s">And</a> if there's revenue generation happening, that's that's sort of a plus and a bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8103.59s">But</a> if <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8104.798s">if</a> people are coming to us because we're the chief, if the desire is because we're the cheapest program, I think that inflates the need in a way that is confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8114.463s">So</a> I just want, I want to have a clear picture of what the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8118.705s">And</a> so that's where that like sort of look at the wait list and other afterschool programs, I think becomes important. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8124.769s">What</a> you would recommend for staff raises sort of independent of tying it to a contract because they are not <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8129.851s">members</a> of collective bargaining and they're not subject to union dues, and frankly their interests in terms of changes to sort of their environment are probably quite different than what our union partners experience and there's, you know, there's 10 unions so like which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8148.689s">So</a> I would like to see what that like recommendation number is as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8152.891s">If</a> you all could think about that when you think about like really drawing a clear capacity picture for us and maybe come back in April or May to talk to us about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8165.116s">We</a> do have one member of the community, but is there any, are there any other questions from the committee before I continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8170.999s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8351.903s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8352.703s">And</a> I think those are those are great illustrations of challenges I think what I would like to hear you all come back and talk to us about is, how can you collaborate across buildings with all these like really smart people we have in our district, and come up with like <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8368.635s">plans</a> or solutions or things to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8371.277s">So</a> I like I totally get it I'm sensitive to all the things you're saying and like waving a magic wand we just like conjure up a new building and it would be this giant like sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8384.961s">I</a> get like sort of the Nirvana point of view, but I think there are some like <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8400.41s">There</a> are some obstacles like in the mix that I would like to see us commit to solve and I think that will require some collaboration from our middle school staff and maybe they need to sort of highlight that in their staff meeting because I don't want your staff feeling unwelcome in our buildings and I absolutely understand how tiring that can be and sort of why <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8425.299s">people</a> would shy away from continuing to try to plug away at that kind of expansion but I also think like there's you know literally hundreds of kids who are trying to come into our program and again if I just like put my business hat on hundreds of kids it's like twice as much revenue as we are pulling through the door on this today and again it's not that's not what we do as a district but it is a <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8453.783s">data</a> point worth talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8455.404s">So</a> if you guys could sort of pull that together, I think that would be super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8460.766s">And</a> I do want to take some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8462.587s">There's</a> at least one hand up on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8464.728s">I</a> know the committee can't see that, but there is one member of the community with their hand up, Lenko.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8478.074s">We</a> can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8478.675s">You</a> have two minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8482.456s">For</a> the record, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8598.082s">Thank</a> you, Lenko. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8599.684s">Are</a> there any other questions from members of the audience? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8609.032s">Okay,</a> so I think we all have sort of asked questions that might warrant a next look. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8615.277s">Oh,</a> Member Ruseau, did you have another question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8618.219s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8624.223s">Motion</a> to approve the new recommended rates for after school, before and after school tuition by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8630.748s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8631.308s">Seconded</a> by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8633.329s">Roll</a> call.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8638.093s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8643.111s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8646.075s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8648.157s">Six</a> in the affirmative one absent the motion passes so tuition rates are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8654.101s">And</a> then I think the question that I would have for the rest of the committee is whether there are any other data requests that you would like to see Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8662.266s">Fidler-Carey</a> bring back to us on a second look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8668.55s">Perhaps</a> you can email the superintendent with what those requests might be if anything comes up in the next week or so to give Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8674.753s">Fidler-Carey</a> some time to <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8676.803s">think</a> through and work with our Director of Data and Reporting, among others, to figure out what all information she can provide us based on what we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8685.344s">Does</a> that work for everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8688.145s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8689.585s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8690.025s">Fidler-Carey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8690.825s">Thank</a> you so much for the opportunity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8706.553s">Sure,</a> so the motion is to get an update in the month of May, in the hopes of being able to look at potential capacity expansion by Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8719.517s">Is</a> there a second?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8720.778s">Seconded</a> by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=8722.538s">Roll</a> call.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9562.775s">I</a> just had one, maybe two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9566.56s">The</a> first is from an equipment needs perspective, how much of this money needs to be spent expended this year, like what's the total that we are seeking from a budget perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9764.176s">I</a> know there's a lot of other budget conversations going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9767.041s">When</a> we have a budget update again, can we talk about whether these requests can be filled in this calendar, in this academic year? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9776.977s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9777.718s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9779.02s">And</a> then just one other question, or it's maybe just sort of a related note is, can we make sure that the filters on the water filling stations are replaced in a timely way? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9790.991s">I'm</a> hearing some chatter amongst the high schoolers who have thoughts and feelings about lots of things, but commenting about how the filling stations that are there don't work because of the filters.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9862.781s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9863.081s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9864.181s">Any</a> other questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9865.922s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9869.514s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9873.135s">We</a> do not have any continued business and we do not have any reports tonight, but we do have some condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9881.837s">The</a> members of the Medford school committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Joe Rossetti, our assistant football coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9891.752s">The</a> members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Denise Parr, wife of former football, Medford High football coach Al Parr. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9901.982s">The</a> members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Fred Knox, former Medford High School teacher and varsity boys baseball coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9912.272s">If</a> we could all rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9933.467s">Our</a> next meeting is on March 18th at Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9940.173s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?<h2><a href="../2024-02-29_3PnEMQz0yA4/2024-02-29_3PnEMQz0yA4.html">MSC - SPECIAL MEETING - Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) School Building Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=135.577s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=138.619s">Member</a> Olapade.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=188.562s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=189.023s">So</a> I think there are lots of ways to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=192.526s">One</a> of the things that we will ask of the committee first is to prepare a report to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=200.875s">And</a> one of the items for consideration is <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=205.359s">What,</a> even in this like first early stage is the plan for community input so I think that's a good mechanism to sort of include in like the monthly reporting in terms of like what is stakeholder engagement look like because it will change over the course of the project, I think it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=222.082s">much</a> less exciting in the first eligibility phase than it will be when you get to things like feasibility and schematic design. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=229.709s">Like</a> that's when, you know, there's lots of planned input that the folks that we hire to do that work will come in and do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=236.596s">So</a> I think it will change over time, but I think it's a good, to me, it's a good call out to think about in terms of like the monthly reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=246.405s">of</a> what has happened, what's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=248.686s">And</a> that might be a good way to make sure that we as a committee are keeping tabs on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=336.008s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=337.149s">I</a> just offered a suggestion which essentially builds out number three and says that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=348.397s">So</a> just sort of sets up that requirement for us to be having that dialogue with the school committee and the building committee together on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=360.717s">Other</a> questions about goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=364.04s">Never</a> so.

<a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=659.514s">Okay,</a> seeing and hearing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=661.936s">Number</a> seven, appoints, defines the membership of the school building committee as A, no more than 15 voting members, B, appoints the following members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=675.044s">So</a> voting members are myself, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=680.899s">Maurice</a> Edward Benson, Suzanne Galussi, Peter Cushing, and Marta Cabral. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=686.704s">And</a> in parentheses, what you see there are the like requirements from MSBA that the various individuals fill, just to show sort of a tie between like what we have to do and what we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=699.415s">And</a> then non-voting members, Bob Dickinson, who's the local budget official, to be determined the MCPPO, Chad Fallon, <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=708.763s">Joan</a> Bowen, John McLaughlin, and Thomas Dalton as non-voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=713.992s">So</a> I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=715.375s">Questions</a> about the appointed members of the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=720.584s">Member</a> Olapade.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=745.37s">Yeah,</a> I actually, that's actually really good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=748.394s">I</a> had a conversation with Chad, the other day we actually have started working through some of the requirements that the vocational school will have to pull together as part of the eligibility phase, and we were meeting and we did talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=763.192s">He</a> reports, I believe, to Dr. Edouard-Vincent directly and Dr. Cushing is responsible for overseeing vocational education as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=772.735s">So</a> he felt comfortable that the vocational school is adequately represented from a voting perspective and was absolutely okay with and fine with being a non-voting member of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=785.078s">He's</a> really excited about the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=788.86s">He</a> is already planning a presentation that will come to the school committee about sort of what he sees as the future and the opportunity and the possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=796.507s">It's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=797.928s">There's</a> lots of exciting stuff to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=799.509s">So</a> certainly from my seat as the chair, I will be looking for Chad's input often as we will all the non-voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=810.999s">And</a> he felt comfortable that his voice was well-represented from a vote, if that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=823.295s">Any</a> other questions about the appointed members? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=831.689s">Seeing</a> and hearing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=834.221s">Okay,</a> so let's move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=836.683s">We</a> are then talking about applications for interested members who include one additional city school committee member, one city Councilor, and applications for seven additional open positions from the community as voting members, Medford public school teachers and staff who are Medford residents are welcome to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=864.424s">So</a> that would be those nine positions I referenced earlier and they are at present all voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=870.99s">So</a> I wanna circle back to Dr. Edouard-Vincent's question about alternates and whether we wanna consider adding some non-voting community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=883.32s">So</a> I just wanted to like bring that back up because I think this would be the place for us to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=887.803s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=979.764s">15</a> voting members, yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1535.355s">Other</a> questions, comments, thoughts?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1628.222s">We</a> have a section that talks about the chair to recommend extensions, recommend replacement of non-participatory members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1642.894s">And</a> so we could <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1647.608s">just</a> simply add here based on the initial application pool where possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1657.937s">I</a> think at some point that pool becomes really stale, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1664.362s">So</a> that it may not last forever, but maybe if we do that, that sort of describes what our intentions are there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1688.25s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1746.964s">Member</a> Reinfeld, did I see your hand?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1790.571s">Sure,</a> so I'm just gonna add this so I can finish my thought.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1804.411s">So</a> Joan has responsibility over MEEP and reports to the superintendent, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1813.515s">The</a> MFN, am I correct that the MFN reports to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1819.017s">Galussi?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1820.277s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1821.017s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1821.278s">Yes,</a> that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1822.901s">Okay,</a> so they are sort of covered by extension through both voting and non-voting members.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1833.646s">Is</a> there a motion to approve the two changes, one to 3B and to seven?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1848.334s">Aye,</a> aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1849.554s">Motion</a> to approve by member Rousseau.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2807.626s">The</a> mayor has been able to secure training for other commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2813.071s">I</a> believe the Charter Study Committee went through a similar process, so we'll bring in somebody to help accelerate that process, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2824.561s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2826.87s">The</a> other request that the mayor had was to potentially move the April 8th date. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2833.919s">April</a> 8th is a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2837.283s">The</a> next committee meeting is not until the 29th of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2846.954s">And</a> so we would, if we did move that, we would also have to move our, we would have to sort of slide our May 1st date and our report to the school committee on May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2860.025s">So</a> that was the other question she asked us to consider in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2864.849s">So</a> I will open that to the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2867.09s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2954.307s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2958.029s">So</a> superintendent, maybe what we can do is set a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2963.551s">I</a> know the mayor's calendar is challenging, so maybe we can set a meeting now in anticipation of when we can begin that work to put the recommendation together for the committee so that we are ready for you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3003.524s">We</a> could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3004.624s">I</a> wondered though, if we, I think we will also have budget meetings scheduled during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3010.906s">Am</a> I? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3013.566s">That</a> is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3014.507s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3015.547s">So</a> how about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3018.048s">Maybe</a> we leave it as it stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3019.828s">And</a> if we have to make some movement of the timeline, we can come back to the committee and let them know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3029.492s">member.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3062.056s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3066.577s">Any</a> other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3071.055s">member.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3071.415s">I</a> felt yes.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4049.686s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4051.147s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4055.005s">This</a> might be a question for the superintendent, but who is responsible for approving operations and maintenance over time?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4127.466s">And</a> in that vein then, are you checking that the overtime that's attributable to revenue for rentals is being charged off? <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4139.43s">So</a> I guess my question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4141.522s">Is</a> somebody just grossly overspending overtime, or is this just an accounting issue that needs to be resolved, and that there actually is no problem with that account?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4287.283s">And</a> can, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4289.679s">In</a> a related question, can somebody take an action item to sit with the head of buildings and grounds and come up with a staffing plan that allows us to budget appropriately next time? <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4301.065s">Because</a> it seems like there's maybe a budgeting issue, but also if this is in fact accurate and we're way overspending our overtime budget, like we need to have a different plan so that we're not blowing our overtime budget because we don't have the money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4319.13s">So</a> I think somebody needs to sit with the Director of Buildings and Grounds and make a staffing plan that we can both operate to in the future, but also sort of get things under control in the right now, because otherwise we're gonna way overspend instead of somewhat overspend, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4338.658s">So</a> I think that is pretty critical, because that's one of the big items that jumps out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4342.119s">A</a> couple of- Is that a motion, Member Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4345.903s">I</a> think I'm just asking that that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4348.906s">I</a> can happy to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4351.548s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that the administration work with the director of buildings and grounds and create a staffing plan so that future budgeting can contemplate planned overtime, and we can curtail overtime spending for the remainder of the school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4442.081s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4442.481s">I</a> think the other thing that I want to make sure we acknowledge is that <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4448.43s">we</a> for the four years that I've been on the committee, we've been talking about making sure we have adequate budgets in various line items like technology replacement and building maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4458.739s">So</a> I think we all sort of know and feel like we're not maintaining our buildings appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4463.684s">But</a> each time we have that conversation, then we encounter a budget issue where we don't have enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4470.95s">And</a> in order to do that on paper, in order to increase <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4474.389s">a</a> budget, you know, a budget for building maintenance on paper, it would mean like cutting somebody who works with kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4485.337s">And</a> so I think the committee has sort of generally said that's, that's not what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4490.601s">And</a> so therefore, like the creative budgeting happens, which is an exercise on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4496.106s">But</a> it is sort of it is a really terrible practice to have, I think the conundrum that we have always faced is <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4504.175s">We</a> each year we set out to do something better and differently and each year the budget numbers just do not reflect an ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4512.159s">So</a> I know that last year we received a whole series of memos about what our plan could be and then when we got our allocation from the city what our plan had to be, and they're, they were different plan they're completely different plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4528.568s">and</a> so it included things like, you know, ESSER's sort of an easy one, but we were going to have $50,000 left in ESSER to roll into this summer and could fund some summer programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4538.293s">And</a> then once we got, you know, sort of the allocation, we approved a budget, but then once we got the allocation from the city, it became clear that we could not sit on that money because that would mean cutting a staff member somewhere else in order to like leave that money in reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4552.06s">And</a> we've just not been willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4556.371s">having</a> gone through all of that over the last, you know, four years, but certainly last year that there was a huge exercise in like, where can we find this money in order to not have to cut staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4569.534s">Because</a> what the city was able and willing to provide to the schools was not enough to do the basic things that we were feeling like we needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4579.497s">And</a> there were some, there were some new things that we had to do or planned to, you know, and plan to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4585.999s">And</a> so I know that sort of complicates the picture each and every time, but I would like to see an actual budget that reflects what the budget should be so that even if we have to make those decisions and changes, like everyone can realize that our building maintenance budget should be half a million dollars and we budgeted 150. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4607.315s">And</a> so therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4609.804s">really</a> should be no surprise when we come in at half a million dollars that we're over by $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4615.185s">So</a> I'm hoping that as you build the budget can really reflect like what does a district of our size need to account for in things like legal expenses and building maintenance and technology replacement and we just we have like never been able to get there for a whole variety of reasons but <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4634.339s">It</a> is, I think, fairly unsustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4636.24s">The</a> other thing I'll say is we, in the series of memos that helped us sort of craft the budget last year, there were lots of positions explicitly being tagged to non-operating fund accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4649.905s">So</a> I think that work to sort of scrub and reconcile that all of that has charged out correctly will be a huge portion of this answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4660.995s">in</a> terms of, because I went back and when I saw this on the agenda, I went back and read one of those and I was like, yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff here that we said we would do elsewhere, like there's some vocational line items and all kinds of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4673.478s">So</a> I think that's really important work that has to be done before we really understand how big of a deficit are we really talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4681.16s">And</a> then I think I have one more question and then I'll let some of my colleagues speak, but <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4686.859s">There's</a> been comments from teachers in the community that they are being told that the schools will run out of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4695.667s">And</a> I'm trying to understand where that's coming from, and whether we have advised teachers that we're going to run out of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4703.736s">And</a> I'd like to make a motion that we do not run out of paper in this school year, because it's just <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4709.744s">Like</a> it is, it is critical to operating and so I really want to get to the bottom of like where this information is coming from because it's being broadly distributed on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4722.352s">believe</a> I know the original poster. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4724.913s">It's</a> a wonderful teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4726.633s">It</a> was one of my daughter's teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4728.274s">I</a> really don't believe he's making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4730.055s">I</a> believe he's hearing it from somewhere from some somebody and that maybe that somebody is very well intentioned but if we're gonna run out of paper, I wanna know about it before we run out of paper because we can't run out of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4744.339s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4792.944s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=4793.644s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=5584.04s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we get an update sometime in March to let us know sort of all the work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=5593.547s">How</a> is it changing the projections?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cgP00rar6II&t=5651.741s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1365.641s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1366.181s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1367.401s">The</a> other thing the MSBA talks a lot about is five to seven is typical and average, but they also talk about some of the factors that sort of slow bog down projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1380.864s">Certainly</a> if there's not like consensus about the project that bogs things down, but as importantly, if you are doing really complex things like consolidating <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1391.505s">multiple</a> schools into one or redistricting like anything that it has to do with like sort of substantially changing the like makeup and chemistry of what goes on in the building, they sort of cite as a reason why things slow down so we don't really have that going on here too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1412.205s">in</a> terms of what we're seeking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1413.966s">So</a> I think that's good news for us because that and those kinds of conversations obviously take the time that they take to unfold in the community and to have broad support and to think about all the impacts to all of our staff and students and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1429.298s">So</a> because we don't have that like the, you know, the five to seven year timeline is sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1435.225s">reasonable,</a> I think, for us to expect out of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1440.147s">And</a> to that, when we talk a little bit later about the building committee, we're going to want to build a building committee that's committed to five instead of seven, eight, nine, 10, because there are lots and lots of kids who have been waiting really patiently for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1457.874s">We're</a> going to miss it completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1460.336s">But</a> more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1461.86s">For</a> me, when I look at all the money we're having to put into the high school to handle massive leaks that happen or asbestos tiles that come off the floor, all of those remediation costs are going to continue to accelerate until we are able to really undertake this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1481.135s">So</a> we should be, in my opinion, trying to move as fast as possible, although the MSBA is going to <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1488.206s">We</a> can't move faster than they're willing to let us move. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1490.469s">So</a> we just need to try to be on the front of the timeline instead of on the back of it as much as possible.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2287.233s">Do</a> you have any information about how frequently the translated agendas are being accessed? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2295.701s">Can</a> we see the click rate or anything on those documents?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2324.321s">Yeah,</a> I would just be interested to know sort of what what kind of access we're promoting
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2420.123s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2421.644s">So</a> I think procedurally we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2426.277s">vote</a> this resolution favorably and then open the floor for the actual discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2432.123s">So</a> my goal with this is for us to really start to talk about things that are collectively important to us as we think about forming the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2442.512s">MSBA</a> is really explicit that local control is <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2448.123s">the</a> answer for all questions about the school building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2453.266s">And</a> they actually sort of decline even to say what you could do or what you should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2457.708s">They</a> really want communities to think through that for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2463.711s">And</a> sort of the consequence of that is if you look at other building committees, some are very small, some are very big, but I'm hoping that first we can pass this and then we can have some discussion if people have things on their mind <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2477.512s">I</a> would love to know that I sort of started drafting a resolution that would allow us to say this is how we're going to proceed forward, but it's very basic right now and I think some of this discussion would help inform that so that we can then review. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2492.862s">something</a> completely and and sort of get that process off to the races. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2497.504s">I</a> would like to see us be able to have that meeting by the end of February so that by the end of March, we have picked our committee and we're sort of a little bit ahead of the eligibility process timeline so that the group can start to meet and they can start to like norm and they can start to learn about their requirements under the open meeting law, etcetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2517.71s">So,</a> anyway, I motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2520.831s">A</a> question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2549.431s">No,</a> if we pass the motion, we'll talk about that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2553.633s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2595.955s">Everything</a> I put on the agenda goes through a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2598.576s">So</a> that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2600.657s">Just</a> that simple.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2665.842s">There</a> is a set of guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2668.165s">I'm</a> going to text you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2669.467s">It's</a> all on their website, so every last bit of information is on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2677.153s">just</a> texted you that I just texted you the link member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2681.179s">They</a> do have requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2683.101s">So</a> for example, they require that somebody on the committee is certified procurement officer, they require that the local chief executive officer, which would be the mayor is on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2695.69s">They</a> require that one school committee member is on a minimum of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2699.973s">The</a> superintendent of schools, the local official responsible for building maintenance is on the school principal is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2709.919s">and</a> a member knowledgeable about the educational mission and function of the facility is on the committee, a local budget official, which would be probably our CFO, and then members of the community who have architecture, engineering, and or construction experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2731.004s">That's</a> the requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2732.064s">There</a> is no requirement to be inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2734.004s">There</a> is no requirement to provide translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2737.47s">all</a> of that is, is subject to local control. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2740.071s">Um,</a> there's no requirement to how big the committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2743.451s">Um,</a> the requirement is that we notify them of who is on the committee, um, and that we identify who's a voting member and that we notify them if things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2752.893s">So,</a> and I think that's really typical in a project that lasts five to seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2756.594s">So</a> I don't think it's necessarily unusual that a committee would sort of change over time, um, through the phases and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2765.516s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2766.121s">The</a> requirements are really about sort of the, I would say like the bare minimum to actually make the project happen, but it doesn't go further than that to describe anything more than that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3284.116s">Great</a> idea.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3287.609s">I've</a> been sort of thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3290.194s">I</a> know somebody who's on a building committee in another community and she said there's like 35 people on the committee, and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3296.428s">That</a> sounds like horribly unwieldy in terms of actually moving the committee through. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3301.392s">And</a> so I've been thinking a lot about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3305.215s">And</a> one, I think one variable is to explore and maybe ask a couple of questions, which I can do of the MSBA about the requirements around non-voting members of the committee, because they can be, you can appoint people to the committee who are non-voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3320.287s">Um,</a> but I, but I also think, um, maybe there's a process for us that says the committee is going to be a certain size through, um, the onboarding of the owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3332.718s">And</a> what that really means is through the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3335.32s">So</a> that is like those, those distinct deliverables, the chapter 74 profile, the educational profile and the maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3343.027s">So</a> maybe there is a possibility for us to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3347.25s">having</a> a committee be maybe smaller for that first phase so that we can move through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3353.557s">And</a> then once the owner's project manager is onboarded, they'll help advise about sort of the broader array of community input that has to and should happen from there on out. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3364.75s">But</a> I also think quickly, as soon as you hire the owner's project manager, you're in the next phase, which is the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3372.032s">And</a> that's where I think the committee actually has to expand and get a little bit bigger, because that's the point at which we're going to consider things like, are we going to try to renovate this? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3383.175s">Is</a> one option to renovate this building in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3385.416s">And</a> that causes disruption, and you have to have mitigation plans for that disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3390.417s">Or</a> is the plan we're going to put it right on the side of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3393.78s">Or</a> is the plan we're going to put it somewhere in the sky? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3396.202s">Or</a> whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3396.702s">We're</a> going to put it in the air rights over Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3398.504s">Whatever</a> those options are, that's to me where the real community conversation starts to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3405.37s">And</a> that's where the energy comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3406.631s">Because</a> people are already talking about, are we going to put it here? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3409.733s">Are</a> we going to put it there? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3410.514s">So</a> I think this upfront phase is sort of our <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3413.874s">requirement</a> to do a lot of blocking and tackling and to fulfill our requirements so that we can get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3419.638s">But</a> once we get there, that's where the community input comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3424.281s">And</a> so I was trying to think through, is there a two-step process to our building committee where that first group is committed through the start of the feasibility phase and can be re-upped if they want to and it's all working fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3440.202s">but</a> also some commitment to expansion when we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3444.023s">Because</a> I do think the value of having a bigger committee is the folks in that feasibility study are gonna be uniquely suited to go out and sell whatever the choice is to the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3453.927s">And</a> we will have to do that in a significant way. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3457.228s">So</a> we will, once we pick, they'll give us three options and we'll say we like option two. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3462.891s">And</a> then we will have to fund that in some fashion, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3466.452s">So</a> whatever the reimbursement rate is from MSBA, <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3469.309s">we'll</a> have to fund the rest of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3471.09s">And</a> so then we will need to mobilize lots and lots and lots of people to turn out a vote that's gonna vote favorably, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3478.276s">So,</a> and if you've been watching the news, a vote just failed north of here at Whittier Tech. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3486.922s">And</a> MSBA, I just saw an article today that MSBA came back to them and said, you've got X days to get this right, or you're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3493.727s">So</a> they are literally at funding and they can't pass a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3498.274s">We</a> can't take that risk because we have no fallback plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3502.038s">This</a> building needs this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3505.321s">So</a> maybe once we get through this first phase in terms of go fast, expanding the committee so that there's a broader cross-section of community members who are supportive and stated are willing to work to support whatever sort of funding is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3525.393s">to</a> sort of bring more people into the fold in that phase, which is, I think, the phase that everyone eagerly wants to get to, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3532.695s">Like</a> this whole, like, how many classrooms do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3536.856s">It's</a> very important, and we have to do all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3540.137s">But</a> I've not heard a single member of the community say, I'm really looking forward to counting classrooms at Medford High, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3545.519s">Like,</a> what they're really interested in is, will it be in place, and will it be in the field, and will it be in the parking lot, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3552.179s">I</a> was sort of trying to think through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3553.52s">I'm</a> not even like sold on it myself, but I think it's a possibility in terms of like how we go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3560.906s">But</a> I also, the other thing I was thinking about is like, is there a shorter term commitment that we're asking people to sign up for upfront? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3569.654s">Because</a> asking somebody to commit to five to seven years is a very big commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3576.267s">So,</a> so how do we sort of strike that balance and in when we put this all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3582.77s">Just</a> be really clear with people about what this looks like like you will need to meet in person and the meetings will be on, you know, we will have this many meetings and like as best we can to inform people of what the requirements are so that we don't have quorum issues and we can actually proceed with sort of our collective intention to move as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3602.751s">So</a> that's some of the stuff I've been trying to think through is like is it a two phase process and do we just sort of design it that way from the beginning so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3613.257s">we</a> can both move fast into the phase that is actually like exciting and like people are eagerly waiting for but also let people know that just because they're not involved in this first phase doesn't mean a we're not interested in their input because there's plenty of opportunity for that but also be that there's still an opportunity when we get to the exciting stuff and then there's probably a whole other group of people who are like <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3633.679s">I</a> want to pick the color of the chairs that is going to go in the new Medford High School and I'm the one that wants to make sure the left-handed desks are there, whatever it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3641.386s">And</a> so there's probably even like phases beyond feasibility that we could think about, but you know, at least up front, there seems like maybe there's a line there that we should explore.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3737.719s">Yeah,</a> I think there's probably like 10 to 15 people in the district that you would want on this committee to cover those bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3749.341s">That</a> was like what I'm remembering when I was like making a mental list. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3752.822s">It's</a> somewhere in that neighborhood of just school administrators, teachers, et cetera, that you would want in the mix before, even before you start talking about members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3763.803s">just</a> to get the educational piece of it, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4634.335s">You</a> know one suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4635.776s">I</a> think there's a really low risk of us like duplicating effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4640.56s">So</a> if you know somebody on this in Somerville, who can like have that conversation with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4647.687s">I</a> think it's would be great for us all to go out and do our own legwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4652.892s">through</a> our networks and have some of those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4656.353s">Representative</a> Garbally offered to provide us a tour or tours at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4661.294s">He</a> is happy to accompany us. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4663.455s">I'm</a> sure he's not going to give us the tour because he doesn't work in the building, but he said he'd be very happy to help arrange something like that in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4670.837s">And</a> Christine Barber said the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4672.618s">Rep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4673.058s">Barber</a> said the same thing in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4675.018s">I</a> do think that once the building committee is formed, they will also want to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4681.44s">We</a> may want to hold off on like trying to tour places until there's a little bit more clarity on the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4687.522s">But</a> I think in the meantime, for us to be sort of talking to people and fact finding and collecting information, I think if people are able to do that in advance of a committee of the whole at the end of February, at some point, I can take a shot at drafting like something that looks like what we've been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4706.65s">And</a> we can start the meeting with like, what, what information did you find and sort of share some information across the various members of the committee who were able to go out and talk to you know whomever. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4718.724s">My</a> cousin is a member of a school committee in the southern part of the state, and they're in the middle of a building project. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4724.691s">So</a> there's, you know, there's lots of people that we know who have like participated in this and gone through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4730.115s">And</a> I think that would be really appropriate to lead off a conversation that then looks at like a nitty gritty resolution about how we might do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4736.64s">So</a> I don't think there's any reason not to do that, if there are people willing to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4741.844s">And</a> I also find that anybody that I've ever contacted through MASC, where I've been seeking information about a district, like people are very happy to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4751.292s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4752.321s">I</a> suppose there's maybe small risk if we all call the same person, but I feel like they're just gonna tell you like, hey, I just talked to somebody from your committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4760.207s">So</a> I think it's probably fine for us to reach out to our networks and then share that information back when we get to the committee of the whole that talks about how we might put this together.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4893.48s">I</a> would make a motion that we schedule a committee of the whole for the end of February, like after February break.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5248.556s">So</a> one of the questions that we asked in, well, a couple of the questions that we asked in the survey was whether there were committees that folks felt we didn't need anymore, and there actually was one, and that was the personal and budget subcommittee, so that's not going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5263.606s">But</a> we recreate these committees every two years, so they're not required to be anything in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5270.831s">And</a> then the other piece of feedback that we did get was that, <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5275.464s">we</a> need a place and a home and a space for capital planning because we have been talking about capital planning for 4 years and we've really not gotten rigorous about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5286.792s">So,</a> we need a place and a space for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5288.433s">So,</a> that's how that came to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5289.974s">So,</a> that all of those changes were based on the feedback that everybody submitted when they submitted what they said they wanted from the committees.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5464.124s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5465.446s">Back</a> in November we talked about the need to just have an ad hoc committee much like we did with the superintendent evaluation process last time around to say, how can we move through what amounts to seven handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5484.138s">four,</a> five, six, seven, eight school handbooks, all of which are supposed to be approved to us when changes are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5489.683s">And</a> I think what we've found over time is that the handbooks continue to change, but they haven't come to this committee to say, are they approved or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5498.15s">And</a> so I think there's just some work to be done that would lay out like how we would even go about that process before we can sort of dive into actually looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5511.3s">handbooks</a> and approving them because it's not effective for seven of us to sit around and look at, you know, many page documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5518.222s">So</a> the goal of the committee would be to figure out what the process should be, whatever it might be, to make sure that we have a routine in place that <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5529.349s">does</a> this on a regular basis and does so in a way that is sort of consistent with the school calendar and how the schools move through their handbook process. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5537.651s">So</a> my motion is just that tonight we identify volunteers to go through a sort of subcommittee process to figure out how should this work going forward so it's sustainable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5594.0s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5597.703s">Mayor,</a> are there any volunteers?<h2><a href="../2024-01-30_D85kYh8WU6M/2024-01-30_D85kYh8WU6M.html">1.29.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2224.711s">Can</a> you provide us some comparable districts that have fully implemented this? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2230.732s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2294.622s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2294.902s">And</a> I think, um, I think my middle school question is really about the kids that are like more than ready for the acceleration. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2304.665s">Um,</a> I understand that the delay helps lots of kids, but there are kids who are more than ready for the acceleration and <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2315.433s">It</a> looks like, like my seventh grader right now, if I like did the jump the math around this, these charts, he's, he's an accelerated math this year, which is like a one and a half, one and a half, which he'll do next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2329.686s">And</a> then in school year 25, 26, he'll take integrated math, which sounds like it will basically be repetition of what he learned in eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2338.974s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2413.501s">And</a> I think the other thing that I've noticed in my house in terms of like the value of now, both my kids having gone through this, and they're totally different, they're very different students in lots of ways, is it was the first time they had to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2429.248s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2430.885s">What</a> that taught them was that they can't just mail it in all the time, which they frankly had been able to do for lots and lots of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2440.293s">And</a> so it was conditioning for them to make a pretty seamless transition to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2445.858s">Like</a> my ninth grader sort of learned about rigor in a way largely because of this accelerated class. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2454.881s">It</a> wasn't as easy for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2456.921s">She</a> had to figure out how to like work through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2458.722s">She</a> had to figure out how to advocate for herself and ask for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2461.903s">And</a> the coursework was more intensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2463.723s">And</a> I think it is in part why she's made a pretty seamless transition to the high school where the work is more intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2471.825s">And</a> I just, I love the idea of differentiation and I just also know how very hard it is to execute that in a classroom with <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2482.908s">20</a> different kids who are doing lots of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2485.269s">So</a> I love this concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2488.23s">I</a> just don't want people to hear about it and think their kid is no longer going to be challenged because we're slowing this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2498.595s">And</a> I think there's lots of parents who went through algebra one and then geometry and then calculus, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2504.317s">Like</a> they went through that path that hear this and think that's not how I did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2509.438s">I</a> am supportive of all of this, but I think the district needs to do a really crisp job of communicating to parents like why this is better for their students wherever their student might be in their like learning progression in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2524.993s">Because</a> I could I could see and I have heard from lots of parents who say like I'm not interested in that I want my kid to be able to like be challenged in math and. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2534.823s">sort</a> of the flip side of that is they're not going to be in this model. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2538.064s">And</a> I don't think that's necessarily true, but I think the district really has to be clear about how that happens so that parents can rethink about math in a way that they've not had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2552.268s">And</a> because this is completely different <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2554.778s">math</a> sequence than we all grew up with.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2652.544s">And</a> I think if Waltham has completed their implementation and could share with you how it has impacted their students, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2662.52s">like</a> across the spectrum in terms of access to calculus and AP class success and all of those things, I think that kind of comparable information would be really helpful because you really are having to retrain a bunch of adults who have only known math one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2685.865s">And</a> I think being able to show them like, see, here's how it's working and here's why it's better, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2692.182s">that</a> kind of exemplar would be really important and powerful for families to hear.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7510.923s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7511.243s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7513.183s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7514.043s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7517.244s">I</a> think the intent of this was not that when it gets hot, we'll consider doing things, but instead that we will do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7525.287s">So</a> I think the lead off sentence needs to change so it doesn't sound like we're going to maybe do it if we sort of feel like it, instead of saying this is actually what you can expect from us when these things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7537.929s">I</a> also think like, as I read it, I got a little bit sort of spun around across the document because I feel like the heat index is super clear and the table, like the set of bullets around caution, extreme caution, danger, and extreme danger is like the right framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7555.374s">What</a> got muddy for me is like, we'll do this if these other set of things exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7562.376s">And</a> I think as I was thinking about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7565.552s">if</a> it's too hot on one day, we should do these things based on what we're saying we're going to do if we're in caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7572.076s">And</a> it shouldn't have to rise to the level of it being many days, but instead, if it hits caution, then we should do the caution things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7580.942s">And</a> if it hits extreme caution, we should do the extreme caution things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7584.925s">So</a> I feel like those three bullets are just throwing me off because I don't see it as, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7593.65s">it</a> feels like that sort of creates like a little bit of a game of like, well, we didn't know it was going to be this way for two consecutive days. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7600.058s">And</a> I don't think that was the intent, but I feel like it caused, like it caused me to sort of read the document a couple times and be like, how does this <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7607.506s">How</a> does this map where I think it just added some confusion that doesn't need to be there? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7612.029s">Because</a> if we're going to do caution things when it's caution, then that's super crystal clear.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7648.911s">Yeah,</a> and I think in a sort of related comment, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7653.769s">To</a> me, there needs to be a set of things we'll do in a building that has air conditioning and a set of things that we'll do in a building that does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7663.119s">And</a> I, so I think like your bullets around caution, extreme caution, like probably in my mind become a table of like, here's what's happening at our elementary schools, at our middle schools, where like where we have working air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7675.526s">And</a> it would include things like three days before we expect this heat to come, we're going to execute a checklist that makes sure all of our systems are in operating order, or five days before, whatever the right timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7686.795s">But</a> just to say that we see it coming, and we're going to be on top of it as best we can, because I feel like we weren't back in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7695.242s">We</a> knew the heat was coming, and still we weren't quite ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7698.985s">So</a> I think part of this is about some trigger for us to say, we're going to go get ready for this <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7705.54s">thing</a> that we think is coming so that we can actually be ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7710.181s">And</a> if we have concerns about an air conditioning compressor, we know it three days in advance to do something alternative rather than it just not turning on on the really hot day and then having no backup plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7724.725s">So</a> to me, what do we reasonably expect with working air conditioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7729.367s">And</a> what will we do in those schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7731.428s">And</a> then the other on the flip side, what are we going to do in the high school where there is no air conditioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7737.11s">And</a> is it appropriate to sort of say, if we have an air conditioning issue in a building, they're going to revert to like the high school plan because they essentially then don't have air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7747.395s">So</a> that to me, that was sort of what I was thinking about as I was reading through this is like that piece needs to be like a little bit more fleshed out and clear so that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7760.484s">evident</a> to people reading it that there are different plans because there has to be like, you know, what we're going to do at the Brooks with working air conditioning, it just doesn't, it's not going to work at the high school for a whole variety of reasons, you know, and, you know, someday we'll get to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7777.596s">But</a> in the meantime, we still have hot days and kids that are in teachers that are in buildings that are excessively hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7786.323s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7787.25s">I</a> think that does sort of when we start talking about like canceling school, like I think that makes it a little bit more complicated because maybe like the answer is you can't, you don't cancel school for almost everybody, but you have to cancel school for the high school because it's oppressive and there's no air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7805.205s">So</a> that's what I want to see in terms of like that piece to be a little bit more fleshed out so that people can visualize like, what does this look like when it happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7816.107s">we</a> everyone can know that we here's what we're doing to get prepared when these things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7821.01s">Here's</a> what makes us get prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7823.072s">And</a> then you know that there's a reasonable expectation that we have time to react when it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7831.037s">And</a> then I think the other question that I had is what is the cost of the items on the list so that we can react to those needs and <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7846.892s">I</a> don't know if you have those costs or how we get those costs, but that was the other thing I was wanting to see is what <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7854.414s">you</a> know, what does it, what will it cost to get these things completed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7938.443s">Because</a> I, and I think first, we have to like know what those things will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7944.027s">And</a> then we have to procure them in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7946.788s">And</a> then to me, they move out of this, like, this is equipment that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7950.451s">And</a> they move into this is how we will deploy this equipment in our like set of caution, extreme caution <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7956.676s">et</a> cetera, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7958.938s">So</a> that people can really reasonably understand what it looks like when these things are in motion and we can communicate about them in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7967.844s">So</a> I think those were my big major questions is just to see a little bit of tightening up of that triggering event. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7977.611s">What</a> are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7979.172s">I</a> think in Arizona, it's probably reasonable that everybody has air conditioning in Arizona. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7983.775s">You</a> don't exist there without air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7987.511s">that</a> is like on top of, on top of, you know, that, but we're not in that position here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=7992.934s">Like</a> we don't have air conditioning at the high school and it's oppressively hot.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8000.959s">Not</a> in most places in the high school that students and teachers are in.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8006.122s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8006.983s">So</a> those are some of the changes I would like to see to this document before we consider it final. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8012.366s">And</a> then I think the other question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8015.705s">you</a> know, again, the cost, but also like what has to change about how our maintenance staff operates in order to make sure all these systems stay functioning.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8259.15s">Mayor,</a> we also got a report about what was functional and not functional, like in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8268.88s">Can</a> you send it to the new committee members?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9138.237s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9139.458s">Can</a> I just ask that we look at an updated version of this with some of the cost information and an extra vision by beginning of March?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9149.103s">Whenever</a> you're ready, but by the beginning of March? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9151.504s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9152.204s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9152.504s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9223.912s">Can</a> I just say something first? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9226.374s">So</a> when I looked at these three deliverables, there's lots and lots of information that, you know, the building committee is going to need to receive and think about when we start to sort of finalize, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9241.704s">There's</a> just a lot of blocking and tackling that's gonna have to happen before the building committee can meaningfully engage with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9248.369s">So</a> the educational profile includes things like, what is the current configuration of your classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9253.173s">How</a> many are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9254.093s">How</a> many science labs are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9256.515s">What</a> is your teaching method? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9257.936s">What</a> is your class size in each of these classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9260.879s">And</a> on and on and on about the space that we use and the way that we educate kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9268.629s">The</a> vocational profile is even more detailed than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9271.872s">So</a> it wants to know our current programs, our current capacity, our desired capacity, any new programs that we're trying to create space for and <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9282.813s">like</a> information that backs up our desire for capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9287.835s">So</a> we would have to show, like if we were saying we want this program to be able to double in size, we would have to show evidence of demand that that is a reasonable thing to be asking for, as well as competitive, like data from the marketplace saying that there is demand in the marketplace for students with these skills coming out and where else we might educate students about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9312.93s">There's</a> a lot of variables going on in the vocational space that have to be collected and then in the maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9319.409s">A</a> couple of important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9321.05s">It's</a> a 20 variable system. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9324.051s">So</a> there's 20 factors that they're going to evaluate us on in our maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9330.034s">Depending</a> on our answers and our practices, we can receive up to two additional incentive points, which essentially means two percentage points of reimbursement over and above what they will set us at as a district based on all the other factors that they usually use. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9347.11s">an</a> increasing number of ways that districts can up their reimbursement rate if they do certain things, if they, in this case, commit to maintaining buildings, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9356.197s">And</a> there's some other places where that becomes important along the way in terms of decisions that the building committee will make. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9362.643s">But</a> the building committee is going to need a lot of advanced work from the administrative team in order to be able to start and get off to the races as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9374.985s">My</a> goal for this, and as I talked to the mayor and to member Rousseau was just to say, we all agree that we want you all to start doing this work to collect this data so that when we form the committee, there's actually just a pile of data waiting for them to start to work through. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9394.591s">And</a> then I did put a resolution on for our next meeting to talk about the creation of the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9402.173s">So</a> we can have that conversation next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9404.649s">sort</a> of as a preview, but hoping that we can pass this tonight so the superintendent's team can get to work.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9774.465s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, Moderator): Um, we do have a committee of the whole on Wednesday from five to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9778.91s">And</a> the goal of that meeting is exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9782.595s">For</a> now, through the end of June, so that we can sit down as a group and say, okay, here are all the planned reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9791.158s">and</a> agree that, yes, we want to receive those reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9793.78s">And</a> if we have questions that we want to be answered in those reports, what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9797.823s">So</a> that the superintendent can better anticipate what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9801.826s">Or</a> maybe we will see something and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9803.987s">We</a> don't need that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9805.208s">Can</a> you just put it in our packet? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9807.389s">So</a> the goal of Wednesday night's meeting is to do exactly that, but just for the time between now and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9814.494s">And</a> my suggestion is we try that out before we <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9818.377s">decide</a> what we like or what we don't like about that planning process so that it's not just like it's not just a sort of a one-way flow of communication but maybe at the beginning of next year we do the same thing for like a for a different like period of time maybe we do for the whole year but I think it's important for us to weigh in not just not just have the superintendent tell us what she plans to do because if she plans to present a presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9847.512s">And</a> we all sit here and say, we actually don't feel like we need that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9852.914s">The</a> time of the team could be better spent doing something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9855.315s">So</a> I want us to really think about, what do we need to hear about at the podium versus, is there something that just needs to go in our packet? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9864.099s">And</a> how do we create space so that we have a reasonable number of things on the agenda at any given time? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9870.922s">And</a> there's space for the unexpected and all those other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9874.98s">I</a> think my suggestion would be that we table this until after Wednesday's meeting, and to give that some time to work and see how we like it before we decide what we're going to do going forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10480.608s">Yeah,</a> just a clarification on what we will do on Wednesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10485.449s">It</a> will certainly be about our list of reports, but it's also about what the superintendent plans her reports to look like between now and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10494.351s">So</a> that if she says, I'm going to come before you and talk about MCAS, and we're like, we don't want another presentation about MCAS, we can agree on that up front instead of, <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10506.035s">having</a> somebody spend lots and lots of time preparing a report and then going from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10510.516s">So</a> it's, to me, what I'm trying to do and why I requested this committee of the whole is to map it all out so that we can see, like, what does the superintendent plan to bring to us and do we agree with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10523.5s">How</a> do we make sure we're getting the reports that we always said we wanted and maybe sometimes get it and sometimes don't? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10529.697s">and</a> what does getting that report look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10532.319s">And</a> we'll also talk about the budget cycle so that it starts much, much sooner than June and some plan dates from the CFO about how we might progress through that so that we can all plan accordingly and we're making sure that we're not sort of pushing lots and lots of stuff at the administration when we're asking them to do all of this other work for MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10556.781s">I</a> see Wednesday as an opportunity to look at what will these meetings look like from the top to the bottom for the rest of the year until June.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10693.995s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10694.976s">Yeah,</a> so I think what I'm trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10699.597s">What</a> the question I'm trying to answer when I requested this report is sort of to be able to size and understand our substitute shortage issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10709.58s">So</a> that's been the subject of a lot of discussion across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10713.701s">It</a> always is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10714.861s">There's</a> lots of reasons why we might have substitute shortage, not the least of which is everyone has a substitute shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10724.243s">It</a> also is probably because of our pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10726.804s">and</a> a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10727.965s">But</a> I think in order to really think about what do we do about it, instead of just say, yes, we have this problem and we're going to talk about it every year as a problem, is really to understand what really is the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10742.593s">What</a> is the need? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10744.034s">So</a> how do we establish what does our district need from a substitute coverage perspective? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10749.577s">And</a> what do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10751.665s">so</a> that we can compare what do we need versus what do we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10755.487s">And</a> then start to look at how are other districts around us compensating substitutes, et cetera, so that we can start to chart a better course forward when it comes to substitute coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10770.435s">So</a> I tried to be really specific in terms of the questions I wanted to answer through this report and the kind of data that I think we need really to <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10779.696s">have</a> a full picture of the the actual problem or the issue as it were. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10785.719s">So</a> that's what that's why it is so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10788.741s">It's</a> just was my attempt to say if we're going to do a report let's be comprehensive and let's have all the let's get bring all of the factors into one place so that we can have a cohesive discussion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10901.26s">Those</a> amendments are fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10902.261s">We</a> wanna add those two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10904.242s">So</a> coverages and long-term subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10908.625s">Member</a> Ruseau?<h2><a href="../2024-01-09_ZTAFqIlEOR4/2024-01-09_ZTAFqIlEOR4.html">1.8.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=292.064s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=293.305s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=441.286s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=441.806s">I</a> actually, you all received from me earlier today just a Google form that outlines what our committees are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=454.008s">Basically,</a> the mayor and I worked on it together, and she was having some access issues to get it out the door, so I sent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=459.371s">But</a> it outlines a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=462.513s">First,</a> it outlines our committees from last time, from the last session. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=467.455s">We</a> are under no obligation to keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=469.877s">So</a> as you look at them, if you're like, I don't know what that committee does or why it would do anything, it's OK to say, I don't think we need that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=477.581s">So</a> for example, in our last session, we had a personnel and budget subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=482.284s">They</a> never met. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=483.342s">And</a> I think that's actually one that I will say I don't think that we need because we tend to operate a little bit differently when it comes to matters like the budget where we tend to all work on them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=494.291s">So</a> that's just going to be my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=496.553s">But</a> there may be other people who feel differently about some of the other subcommittees that are listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=503.038s">And</a> so there's one component of the request is just to hear from you all what you think the committee should be, the standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=512.904s">And</a> then another piece for you to tell us what committees you want to be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=519.609s">So</a> subcommittees are comprised of three members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=522.39s">They</a> can't be comprised of more than three members, because then that represents a quorum of this larger committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=527.914s">And</a> suddenly, you're not a subcommittee anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=529.575s">You're</a> actually just the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=531.496s">So</a> the subcommittees tend to do work that is sent there by this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=537.182s">You</a> there, there are some sort of exceptions, but generally something comes to the floor and we say, we want to send this to subcommittee to be to, to, to do X, Y, or Z. And so the way I set up the request, um, after we had some discussion about it was to say, please tell us what, how you want to be involved in these committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=555.694s">Like</a> you don't have to be involved in any committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=558.556s">Um,</a> you could be involved in all of the committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=561.277s">It</a> sort of depends on interest and time and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=566.035s">But</a> I also provided a place for people to say, I'd like to chair this committee, or I want to be on this committee, or I'm willing to be on this committee, which I think is just a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=577.779s">And</a> then I don't want to be on this committee for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=582.304s">And</a> then we can get all those results and then take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=585.725s">And</a> in a future meeting, the mayor can present to us what her like proposed subcommittee structure is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=593.809s">And</a> based on that feedback, and then we can have some discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=597.03s">We</a> all ultimately have to vote on it, but it is just a good way for you all to say like, these are the topics that interest me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=605.933s">It's</a> okay for you to say, I want to be the chair of something, even if you've never done it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=611.271s">help</a> you manage through those first ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=613.093s">Like</a> the subcommittees are a really nice place to do that because they tend to be sort of confined topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=619.778s">Like</a> you'll be working on a specific thing or reacting to something that came to you by the larger committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=626.123s">So</a> you all have that, I think, in your email box. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=628.886s">And</a> if you don't let me know and I'll send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=631.528s">But</a> really it's just a chance for us to say like, are these even the right committees for us anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=636.712s">If</a> there's stuff you think we should be adding, like there's a space for you to do that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=641.192s">The</a> high school building committee, completely separate topic and not part of what we're signing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=715.182s">So</a> last term, we basically took what previously was family engagement, communication, and strategic planning and separated it, which I think there's just too much going on there for it to be one topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=728.806s">So</a> last term, we did separate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=730.987s">Both</a> did meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=732.507s">There's</a> at least one thing, I think, in strategic planning right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=736.468s">And</a> I was just waiting to schedule something to, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=739.522s">move</a> forward on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=740.162s">So</a> I do think those two things, those two make sense to carry over from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=744.204s">And</a> I put superintendent evaluation on because it was an ad hoc last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=748.687s">But</a> if, if we think that we want to continue with that process, we should just make it a standing committee so that there's some expectation there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=808.279s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=812.884s">And</a> so I had one other topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=815.426s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=817.128s">I</a> reached out to me I see because they do a whole variety of training. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=822.633s">But</a> one of the trainings that Tracy Novick will do on our for us is a training around Chapter 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=829.079s">So</a> Chapter 70 is how the state funds municipalities as it relates to education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=834.633s">There's</a> a lot of changes happening in Chapter 70 because of the Student Opportunity Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=838.716s">And</a> we're like maybe a little bit more than halfway through the full funding of Student Opportunity Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=843.84s">But</a> Chapter 70 funding is wildly complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=846.602s">It's</a> one piece of how our schools are funded in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=851.386s">But</a> Tracy is willing to come and do a training session with us about Chapter 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=857.951s">And</a> every time she does this talk, she picks <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=861.082s">she</a> picks a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=862.103s">So</a> when you go to charting the course, you'll see her pick a community and then sort of dive through their chapter 70 and say, this is what's really happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=869.55s">Like,</a> this is what these numbers mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=870.951s">This</a> is how this impacts them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=873.173s">And</a> every time I go and I listened to her do this chapter 70 talk, I'm like, she picked Medford because I would be really interested on her take on what is happening in chapter 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=882.701s">So</a> I reached out to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=884.742s">She</a> said, it's about like an hour and a half ish training. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=888.306s">And</a> she has pretty open availability in the month of February, which I think is good timing for us to do that before budget season really starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=898.208s">And</a> she I just told her that I would bring it to the group and we could decide if there was a date and time that would work well, but I think it's a nice sort of lead into the budget discussions which will become just a huge part of what we're doing here soon so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=914.189s">I</a> think the question is really around scheduling and whether we want to try to find a time to do that as a group, not knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=921.114s">I</a> think the other thing that would be helpful, I think, for all of us is to know generally when are people available? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=928.099s">Can</a> you start a meeting at 5 or 6? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=930.82s">Are</a> you not available at all on Wednesdays? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=932.762s">Those</a> kinds of things I think maybe we should try to understand better across this new committee, because I think you learn that over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=940.816s">In</a> the meantime, to schedule this, I think we would just need some date options that we could bring to Tracy and see if she can plan to come in and do this training for us on one of those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=951.219s">Sounds</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=951.659s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1020.29s">We</a> have the consent agenda, bills and- Before you go on, we probably should have started with like what the good of the order is in case you, the new folks don't know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1031.813s">It</a> would be weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1032.533s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1032.693s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1033.613s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1033.993s">You</a> said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1034.413s">You</a> told us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1036.334s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1036.774s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1037.154s">Good,</a> good, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1037.654s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1038.274s">I</a> just wanted to make sure like we're not leaving you in the dust as we explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1041.915s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1042.595s">But</a> I appreciate that leaving us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=3975.937s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=3977.579s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4013.465s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4017.129s">Oh,</a> wait, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4017.909s">Did</a> I say the wrong thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4019.41s">Did</a> you say me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4020.87s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4021.271s">It's</a> a little hard to hear you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4385.483s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4386.965s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4389.136s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4389.696s">I</a> had one question and perhaps one amendment if my colleagues are so inclined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4397.082s">The</a> first question I had on the first page under number four, reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create replacement timeline for individual systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4407.289s">Who</a> do you envision is on this committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4471.684s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4472.545s">My,</a> my major request is that this committee participate in that process actively versus sort of get something when you all think you're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4482.293s">So</a> I think we just need to think about that, especially with the subcommittee structure, like just figure out like the right way to do that and make sure that the committee can be apprised of like the consideration and the work that's being done because all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4496.496s">You</a> know, add up to either surprises where we're having to say to the mayor, like, hey, we don't have money for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4502.041s">And</a> does the city have money or we have to find money in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4506.204s">And</a> so all of that sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4508.81s">So</a> I would like this committee to have some way to know, like, when the meetings are like what what the meetings are happening about what the content is and then some way for us some portion of us to participate, whether that's like the building and grounds committee or the strategic planning committee like there's places where. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4527.247s">those</a> updates could happen in subcommittee, which I think is totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4530.069s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're on the same page that we need to participate in that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4558.909s">I</a> think we can like work all of that out once the subcommittees are established and defined and all of that I just wanted to make sure that was on your radar that we should be participating in that process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4573.636s">And</a> then my possible amendment is on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4579.941s">number</a> 12 around the strategic plan and I think what you added to that was developed with the with a engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders which when we do strategic plan that's absolutely how we should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4594.525s">I</a> am questioning whether that is reasonable to accomplish this year and I say that really specifically with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4603.928s">In</a> mind, some of the strategic work that the administration is going to have to do in preparation for MSBA so I think I'm concerned that there's just no way that you that the administration can do both of those things well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4618.52s">Between</a> now and the end of the year so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4621.104s">when</a> I think about the strategic work that has to happen on the MSBA side, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4625.906s">Like</a> there's, it's sort of a wide ranging set of activities, including like counting classrooms, but also talking about like, what's the educational plan we're trying to provide, collecting up past enrollment and looking at future enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4640.052s">And</a> because we have a vocational school, there's a whole complexity around the vocational school and the programming that we offer and what we want, what the capacity is right now and what we want the capacity to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4651.92s">And</a> then new programs we might want to sort of provide for in addition to a whole maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4656.985s">So</a> there's so much strategic work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4659.267s">I</a> know there's like a scheduling thing going on right now as well in terms of updating the high school schedule and the middle school schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4665.712s">All</a> of that has to get done in order for us to meet the requirements of our eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4670.696s">And</a> if with all of that work that has to get done, I just don't see how you also can have a meaningful community engagement process around the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4681.007s">So</a> I would like to make a motion to approve this with the amendment that we strike number 12 completely, because I just don't think it's reasonable for you to accomplish that right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=4994.91s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to offer maybe another suggestion to one thing that family and community engagement subcommittee could do this year is <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5004.73s">sort</a> of articulate and map out what a strategic planning process that includes meaningful community engagement looks like for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5013.177s">Because</a> I think in my mind, I would just like everyone to just keep working at the strategic plan that exists right now, hit pause on the idea of creating something new for just a couple months so that we can get this MSBA process off to a good solid start. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5032.952s">And</a> in that time, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5035.094s">subcommittee</a> could meet and say what would it look like for the community and families to be meaningfully engaged in a strategic planning process and outline that so that at the beginning of next year when we say okay we're ready for the strategic plan we can say and this is what <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5051.348s">we</a> sort of think and recommend that this looks like from an engagement perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5055.329s">So</a> I think something like that probably could be accomplished in like a meeting or two, and also provide sort of good preparation for when the administration's gonna turn their attention to that next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5068.673s">So</a> that is sort of what I'm thinking, because I agree, I don't think we wanna say, we're not trying to say that we don't want community engagement, that's not it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5078.656s">I</a> think what we are saying though is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5080.572s">There</a> are only 24 hours in the day and strategic planning is really hard, earnest work, and there's just not time to do it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5087.033s">And</a> I would rather us just push it off a little bit if it means we have an opportunity to do it well then, rather than do it now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5604.585s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5606.047s">I</a> was not necessarily planning for this to happen on the same day as the playground groundbreaking but it was exciting it's sort of exciting that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5616.081s">So,</a> when we, when we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5620.668s">the</a> adopting our policy around dedication and naming of buildings, facilities, and grounds, which is FF. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5626.51s">And</a> I did ask the superintendent to put this in your package just so you had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5631.652s">Last</a> year, sort of right at the same time, we were talking about the McGlynn playground and I offered to draft a resolution, which I have finally done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5643.776s">So</a> my apologies for the delay to open up a donation <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5650.006s">mechanism</a> for the community to participate in funding the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5654.207s">So</a> while the vast majority of all the big components of the playground are funded, there is an opportunity for additional funding to offset the overall cost of the playground, but also to help us do things like put mature plantings in instead of much younger plantings that are going to take longer to create the shade that we're looking for or the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5680.532s">structures</a> that we wanna see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5683.074s">So</a> there's plenty of opportunity and we know that money is not endless for these kinds of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5692.021s">So</a> I put this forward totally not wed or tied to really any of it, except that the playground committee has talked about wanting to make sure that how people donate to the playground <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5707.591s">can</a> be recognized in one central place and that we not be offering up naming rights to individual like pieces of equipment because it was the team's belief that we shouldn't, you shouldn't be able to buy your spot on a, an inclusive playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5726.563s">I</a> felt like a plaque on the outside that says, here's all the people who donated is a great way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5731.087s">And</a> maybe it's going to be a big plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5733.409s">I</a> think that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5734.25s">Maybe</a> it's a sign instead of a plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5735.671s">I</a> think that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5738.113s">But</a> I think providing some sort of mechanism so that we can create a way for people to participate is important, but sort of stopping short of like <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5749.19s">naming</a> things and bushes and pavers and cobblestones and I'm trying to stay away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5755.133s">I</a> was trying to stay away from that in terms of the structure that I set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5757.674s">So</a> totally open to suggestions or changes and hopefully we can do this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5994.693s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=5995.073s">So,</a> my expectation would be given that we don't know what we will generate in terms of revenue that once we have an idea of what that looks like, the playground committee will work with the builder or the contractor and the architect to figure out like are there features that needs that can be added like where do those mature plants go, etcetera that sort of makes sense or is it that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=6022.564s">we</a> need to draw less from CPC or like what's the recommendation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=6027.989s">So</a> I would expect the playground subcommittee chairs to help lead that in concert with the city.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=6065.684s">I</a> was sort of taking the approach that we'll always take your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=6073.535s">But</a> I think to your point, like perhaps there is a timeframe where we say like, we'll, we'll like plan by this date and the playground committee might need to give us what that reasonable date is to say by that all the money received by this date, and maybe that's the like sort of one of the qualifiers like that we can add to this so we can maybe just add a placeholder for like a date certain that we will <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=6099.708s">know</a> finalize the plaque and do all of that stuff.<h2><a href="../2023-12-19_PZnGMmPL0QE/2023-12-19_PZnGMmPL0QE.html">12.18.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2322.076s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2324.077s">Member</a> Kreatz or Kathy, I feel like we probably would have never known each other outside of school committee because our kids are very different ages and you live on the opposite side of town from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2336.344s">And</a> so our paths just like naturally wouldn't have crossed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2338.465s">But</a> I did get to know Kathy, particularly when we were going through the process of weighing the options for our next superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2345.669s">And</a> Kathy and I had a lot of conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2348.168s">Like</a> what does Medford need and who are the candidates and who are the right candidates and I remember that we had one of those conversations, which was supposed to be quite short at snappy patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2358.52s">And</a> we had a we had a great conversation, it took a very long time and next time we go to snappy patties together we're going to have to insist that pat join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2367.929s">in</a> the conversation because he was like, oh, no, no, this is, you know, Kathy's working on business right now and I can't possibly join you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2375.833s">And</a> so poor Pat sat there by himself for like two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2380.196s">So</a> next time we'll have to like bring him into the fold when we go to Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2386.239s">And</a> I promise we will not forget about the vocational school while you're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2391.121s">And</a> I think we actually have lots of, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2393.303s">super</a> interesting opportunities when we talk about MSBA and I know we'll talk about that later tonight to really think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2399.878s">vocational</a> education and what it needs and what the possibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2403.641s">So</a> I'm super excited for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2405.602s">And</a> we will not forget them, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2411.186s">Member</a> Hays, again, like our kids are closer in age, but a little bit different age. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2416.83s">They</a> went to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2418.031s">So</a> I really enjoyed campaigning with you and winning with you two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2423.495s">That</a> was certainly, it's always nice to win, but it's nice to win with friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2427.458s">So</a> that's super great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2430.071s">And</a> I actually found some of my notes from a really early conversation that Sharon and I had from even before we took office about some of the goals we had for a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2440.216s">And</a> we actually accomplished so many of them in two short years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2444.217s">It</a> was actually sort of nice to like take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2446.498s">I</a> was like, oh, I need to save this for later when I'm feeling like we haven't, you know, when you always feel like you haven't done enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2452.201s">It</a> was nice to see just how many things we actually had completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2455.102s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2457.6s">And</a> Mia, I wanted to sort of thank you for leading the way on constituent services, because I don't feel like that was a real priority of most of the committees before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2471.553s">And</a> in a district that has its warts and is imperfect at times, like that is such a critical role that we play. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2480.339s">It</a> doesn't happen in these meetings and it doesn't happen on the floor, but you spend countless hours with people talking about what their concerns are, how they can address them, providing guidance in terms of how parents can advocate for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2494.726s">So</a> thank you for leading the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2497.808s">It's</a> become a huge part of what the community expects the school committee members to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2502.53s">And</a> I think that until we have a perfect school system, that's really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2508.113s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2510.195s">And</a> I think the other thing that you started, being the trendsetter that you are, was really both you and Kathy being school committee members that are also active parents with children enrolled in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2523.464s">And</a> I think that is so important in terms of really understanding what the community is looking for, and from this seat, being able to represent <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2534.119s">not</a> just what like your kids are going through, but what your, what your kids' friends are going through, um, sort of makes you a better school committee member in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2541.521s">So</a> thank you for, um, pushing us all forward in that manner as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2546.962s">You</a> will all be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2549.762s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4085.588s">Thank</a> you member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4086.769s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4088.35s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4090.272s">Same.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4090.792s">I'm</a> looking forward to moving as quickly as possible and we were at the school committee conference back in November before MSBA had <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4099.451s">made</a> their final decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4101.092s">And</a> I asked that question of them, which is how do we, what advice do you have for communities who are ready to move? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4108.477s">Like</a> we are, you know, long past the time where we should have been starting this through a whole variety of unfortunate events, but here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4118.024s">So</a> what I can say is that there's just a lot of work ahead, but that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4123.43s">this</a> first step is critical because now we get to move as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4128.351s">So</a> until now we sort of haven't been able to do that unless we were as a community sort of flush with hundreds of millions of dollars to build a school on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4139.215s">And</a> that hasn't gone great for other communities who have gone down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4142.836s">So</a> the eligibility period though is pretty pivotal from a scoping perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4148.097s">So</a> there's a lot of things that have to happen in the next <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4151.318s">x</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4151.959s">We</a> have 270 days to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4155.463s">But</a> there are some really important questions that we'll talk about as a district and as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4161.923s">including</a> things like what are our enrollment projections? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4164.444s">What</a> kind of vocational programs do we wanna have? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4167.104s">What</a> is our capacity right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4168.864s">What</a> do we want our capacity to be in those programs in this new building? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4173.045s">And</a> basically sort of all the things that go into deciding what size space is going to go out to the bidders to say, now we need you to tell us what is feasible, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4184.608s">But</a> the other sort of things that are, I think we're lucky enough to have incorporated in our bid are things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4191.547s">What</a> about our pre-K programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4193.229s">So</a> we have just a huge strategic opportunity because we have pre-K programs in that building today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4198.995s">And</a> our invitation included the acknowledgement that we had programs like the MFN in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4207.202s">And</a> we have several preschool programs with Kids Corner and then with the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4213.364s">We</a> also have an opportunity to talk about how to best serve our students at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4218.566s">Transporting</a> them across the city for some of the opportunities that they might want to take advantage of is a huge challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4224.528s">So</a> we'll be talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4226.83s">And</a> then we will also in this eligibility phase be talking about how do we maintain our spaces and what are our plans and how can we promise and demonstrate to the MSBA that we'll be good stewards of the state's money when this building comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4243.145s">And</a> then also in this phase, we will form a building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4246.989s">That's</a> one of the requirements of the phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4249.266s">And</a> that's where we will look. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4250.968s">There's</a> a lot of requirements to meet even in forming a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4254.151s">So</a> there's a really like specific set of individuals that have to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4258.916s">But</a> this is our opportunity to say how do we want to do this together in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4262.9s">So</a> all of that is coming in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4266.519s">And</a> I think a lot of people have asked a lot of questions about like, is it a new school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4270.322s">Is</a> it a revised school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4271.723s">Is</a> it at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4272.824s">Is</a> it on the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4273.724s">Is</a> it in a different location? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4275.446s">All</a> of those questions don't start to get asked and answered until the eligibility phase is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4280.089s">So</a> I think this initial phase really sets up sort of the bones of the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4286.574s">And</a> then that feasibility study that happens next will actually allow us to say what is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4292.774s">Um,</a> what do we want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4294.155s">What,</a> what do we want to do and how could we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4296.197s">So</a> that feasibility study happens at the conclusion of eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4300.48s">Um,</a> so we don't have those answers just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4303.302s">And</a> I just want people to know it's nobody's, um, nobody's got any secret answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4307.545s">Um,</a> they, they truly don't exist yet because we will hire, um, professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4312.349s">We</a> will hire an owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4314.191s">We'll</a> hire architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4315.371s">Those</a> folks will help us based on this eligibility work that we're doing really thoughtfully to say, here's how you meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4323.121s">Here's</a> what your choices are as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4325.762s">And</a> then, you know, here's how you can sort of move forward into the building phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4329.483s">So</a> we're a bit away from some of those questions, but we're going to move as fast as we can to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4334.945s">Because</a> I think that's the, those are the real questions people are impatient to ask and answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4339.626s">And</a> I totally get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4341.487s">My</a> daughter will definitely not graduate from any sort of a revised school and like, fingers crossed, if we move really fast, Lucas might make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4349.898s">Um,</a> and so I'm super sensitive to the generation of kids that has, um, not had the benefit of, um, some sort of beautiful new building and, and it's sort of incumbent on all of us to figure out how do we move as fast as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4362.448s">So</a> there are as few of those kids as possible out there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4607.164s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4608.745s">I</a> am generally supportive of getting a report that does many of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4614.862s">But</a> there are some things on this list that A, are not appropriate for the administration to weigh in on because they are subject to negotiations, which are held by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4625.949s">There</a> are others on this list that talk about the vision for MHS, which I believe will be handled in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4635.433s">when</a> we talk about the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4637.013s">So</a> I would like to make a motion to sever items two, three, four, and nine from this, because I just don't think it's appropriate for this committee on its way out the door to be describing or dictating the future bargaining position of the committee that they will not be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4655.399s">So</a> bargaining negotiations are a whole strategy and deciding one piece of a strategy in advance of <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4664.601s">a</a> new and entirely new committee that's gonna take a seat, I think is not appropriate at this time for this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4669.642s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion to sever two, three, four, and nine from the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4674.583s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2023-12-05_3-zXI9WME5I/2023-12-05_3-zXI9WME5I.html">12.4.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=3879.977s">We</a> skipped over item five, the consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=3882.397s">It</a> was on the front page.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6542.837s">Mayor,</a> can I just ask one more question? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6545.338s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6548.297s">I</a> thought the value of math was that you could connect performance year to year, and now you're saying that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6559.865s">Which</a> is it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6659.025s">Yeah,</a> and I think the reason I'm asking, let me just like tell you why I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6663.087s">If</a> that's true, then why are we crushing students and teachers under three iterations of this in a school year? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6669.195s">The</a> last of which comes like hot on the heels of MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6672.321s">And</a> then we're saying, well, it's not really like data we can use the next year anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6675.768s">And</a> if that's true, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6677.904s">Why</a> are we testing for the sake of testing, I think is what I'm wondering about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6683.187s">If</a> there's value in that carryover in terms of informing instruction, then I think it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6689.65s">But</a> I feel like I'm sort of hearing either we're not using it that way right now or it's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6694.952s">And</a> I don't know which, but I'm just really trying to understand there's a lot of testing that goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6700.415s">And</a> I know that we can't just say we're not going to do MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6704.237s">I</a> get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6705.546s">it's</a> still, it's a lot, like it's a lot of days of testing and could the kids be actually learning something instead, is my question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=6878.856s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8001.67s">Can</a> I just ask a quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8004.572s">I'm</a> looking at, um, what is this third grade math, third grade math. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8011.455s">And</a> it looks like the numbers on the left add up to more than a hundred.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8017.784s">Because</a> I was trying to figure out like it looks similar, but it's.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8026.308s">Is</a> there a reason for that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8043.459s">Well,</a> yeah, it's just hard to compare. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8045.58s">If</a> this is a predictor, did we meet the prediction, or did we do better or worse than the prediction? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8053.404s">But</a> you're never going to meet the prediction if you're not on the same scale, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8057.045s">Because</a> on the right, 41.32. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8062.811s">95,</a> yeah, the one on the right adds up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8065.912s">So</a> you can't eyeball this and say we were on target or we weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8072.214s">And</a> I can't tell if it's because the left adds up to more than 100 or if we're really on target or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8079.417s">So</a> it would be great if you could get an answer to that question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8171.294s">Yeah,</a> I think on the eighth grade one, the charts both add up to 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8174.276s">So</a> is what this is telling us that MAP predicted we would have better MCAS results than we actually had?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8187.123s">Eighth</a> grade, slide 16.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8191.926s">Yeah,</a> ELA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8192.467s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=8217.634s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10226.021s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10227.342s">I</a> just wanted to offer maybe a suggestion about <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10231.018s">Like</a> I think part of what's happening is there's too much data at the wrong level of detail for this audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10237.783s">And</a> so while I would expect other audiences to sort of need and want various like components of data in here, like it's not actionable for this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10247.511s">So</a> I just wanted to share like a couple of thoughts and maybe like this can help inform the next presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10255.317s">And</a> it's just my, these are just my opinions, but <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10258.769s">There's</a> several slides about data observations, and they only talk about the good ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10264.972s">They</a> only talk about the places where we're exceeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10268.774s">And</a> as we were sitting here, I went through all of the appendix charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10276.998s">And</a> my observations are that our black and Latino students are below the national average across the board, all schools, all topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10287.546s">Not</a> all places, but lots of places. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10292.632s">In</a> addition to that, at the McGlynn Elementary School, there's something happening in grade three, ELA math and science, all subgroups are sort of noteworthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10304.035s">At</a> the Missittuck, math and science are noteworthy, and that means beyond our Black and Latino students, as I talked about being a high-level overall norm. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10313.46s">At</a> the Roberts, it's math. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10316.002s">At</a> the Andrews, it's science. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10317.783s">And</a> at the McGlynn, it's science. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10319.929s">definitely</a> science and ELA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10323.331s">And</a> so when I look across that, like what I would like to see in the future is like, I absolutely think we should celebrate where we're successful, but I'd also like to see like, what are the five to 10 things where you all are like, these are the things that we saw and this is what we're doing about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10339.658s">And</a> so, for example, if it's like a particular grade level at a particular school, <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10344.758s">like</a> there's an intervention there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10346.699s">And</a> so I think what we wanna know, what I wanna, I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10351.241s">What</a> I wanna know is that you all know what those flash spots are and that you are like working immediately to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10360.405s">And</a> then in the next presentation, you can come back to us and say, we talked about these flash spots, here's what changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10369.929s">So</a> if it were my presentation, <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10372.529s">I</a> would cut out a lot of the detail that's particularly around the digging into the student dashboards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10379.931s">I</a> think that's super cool and interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10381.591s">But</a> without having access to the tool to be able to do that, I think it suggests more questions than it answers for us, or at least for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10391.754s">What</a> I would rather see is, what are those trends, good and bad? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10396.355s">What</a> are the interventions? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10397.635s">And</a> then just the appendices. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10400.174s">make</a> every single one of these charts a heat map. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10403.197s">So</a> you can see green, yellow, red, students who are below the national average in which spots, green, who's above, and then who's like right on the line, either like a little bit above, a little bit below. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10414.746s">And</a> then you can look at it and visually, you know, like there's a lot of green on this chart, or there's a lot of red on this chart, or look at the red, it's all in the same column and across all of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10423.574s">So</a> we haven't, we haven't done enough to move that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10426.156s">Like,</a> I think there's some like, <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10428.064s">Simple</a> visual cues in addition to like putting the district wide number on the on each of the charts, I think that would also be helpful, but I would streamline everything to like highlights problems interventions here's what we're doing here's what's changed and then here's your appendices and. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10444.293s">We</a> don't have to keep you here at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10446.338s">9pm</a> sort of answering questions that I think in fairness, like, there's nothing we can really do with the information you're providing us, except that, like, as we're going through this, and we have questions like the data needs to be cleaned up so that things add to 100, that all of the subgroups are available, like, that would be my focus for this as you go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10466.972s">And</a> I think even in terms of the district-wide priorities, learning walks, et cetera, et cetera, I think we know all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10475.676s">We've</a> heard you talk about them all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10477.437s">But</a> I looked at it, and I was like, what's going on in middle school science? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10481.119s">And</a> we have a new curriculum there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10482.66s">Do</a> we have a problem, or is something else going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10487.302s">But</a> I think you can be much more targeted if you're talking about here are the top five things that we're working on district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10492.825s">at</a> the district level with an assumption, I think, from all of us that, yes, you're meeting with grade level teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10498.908s">Yes,</a> teachers are using this tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10500.469s">Everybody's</a> doing their leveling of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10504.43s">But</a> I think what we want to know about is, in the aggregate, are we providing the right support to classrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10510.313s">to</a> teachers, to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10512.474s">And</a> I think using some of the aggregated data is actually the way for us to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10518.295s">But</a> I think we're a little bit all over the detail map tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10521.836s">And</a> I think that's why everyone's sort of eyes are drooping. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10526.278s">And</a> I think everyone's sort of feeling frustrated, or at least that's sort of my takeaway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10531.099s">But</a> I think those small changes would make a big difference in terms of how we can have a productive conversation about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3-zXI9WME5I&t=10539.162s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2023-11-21_2myy3HykAAc/2023-11-21_2myy3HykAAc.html">11.20.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7188.501s">Motion</a> to revert to the regular order of business by member McLaughlin, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7192.602s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7193.182s">Member</a> Kreatz, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7194.963s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7196.483s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7199.224s">Okay,</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7200.344s">So</a> we have good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7202.044s">Motion</a> to take good of the order off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7205.058s">Oh</a> no, we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7206.418s">So</a> we have good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7208.159s">And</a> for those of you who are new, the good of the order is a time and a moment where on a monthly basis as a committee, we have an opening to talk about and reflect on sort of how the committee is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7221.021s">So</a> when we talk about the good of the order, we're talking about the order of the school committee and how we're carrying out our rules and policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7226.962s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7372.028s">And</a> I think just to follow on to that, if I may, as the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7376.614s">We've</a> been in communication with the new members about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7380.419s">That's</a> why they're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7381.46s">We</a> made sure they got packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7383.122s">Thank</a> you, Miss Malone for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7385.925s">And</a> the superintendent is working through their onboarding process in the paperwork and <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7390.454s">setting</a> up a meeting and some time to go in and meet with central office to start to get to know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7396.136s">That's</a> a process that will take years, probably by the time it's all said and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7402.717s">But</a> certainly to start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7405.198s">I</a> was in touch with MASC last week about the upcoming charting the course dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7412.44s">They've</a> not yet been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7414.2s">But</a> statutorily, you're all required to attend a one-day training session just one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7420.602s">But</a> it's actually a great refresher for all members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7424.343s">And</a> it covers everything from how meetings run and the open meeting law, all the way through to the budget and all the other responsibilities of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7435.915s">It's</a> a pretty fast and furious kind of training, and it leaves you having maybe more questions than less, but at least you know what those questions are at the end of the time, and we can guide from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7447.362s">We</a> also were talking last week, the superintendent and I, about doing a training retreat, which we often do at the start of term. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7456.887s">And</a> then the other request that I made to the superintendent is that we actually schedule some time with Tracy Novick to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7463.792s">budget</a> and school funding in particular, because Chapter 70 is very complicated and it is changing with the Student Opportunity Act, and she does sessions that are finance-oriented that I think will be helpful, particularly as we <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7478.905s">that</a> one of the biggest things that you will do in the first six months of your tenure is set the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7484.689s">So</a> that's a really complex process for a lot of reasons, but sort of understanding where the funding comes from is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7492.994s">So</a> we'll look to schedule both of those sessions, probably not at the same time, but over the course of the first couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7500.939s">And</a> then I think we do need to work offline on that orientation and onboarding, and I will connect with you separately on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7566.694s">And</a> then the last thing I'll say about onboarding, I know that member Rousseau has also sent you a copy of our rules document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7574.04s">We</a> have that for the first time really in ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7577.722s">So</a> I know there's a lot of rules there and it's overwhelming, but the goal of those rules is really to say like, how can we function most effectively as a body so that we can get the work done of the committee, which is quite particular under the law and then <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7594.658s">also</a> have some mechanisms to manage everything else that comes their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7597.662s">So</a> there'll be plenty of opportunity to change the rules and we'll talk all about all of those processes as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7605.512s">Other</a> questions from the committee about the good of the order? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7613.482s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7615.516s">Then</a> we will move on to item number five, which is the consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7619.078s">It</a> includes bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes from October 16th, committee of the whole minutes from November 1st, and committee of the whole minutes from November 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7629.486s">Is</a> there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7631.348s">Motion</a> to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7634.931s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7635.771s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7637.272s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7639.154s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=7641.179s">We</a> have no report of subcommittees, so we are on to the report of the superintendent, and I will turn it over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8301.391s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8303.532s">Next</a> on the agenda, we have McGlynn Elementary and McGlynn Middle School update. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8308.453s">Mr.</a> Andy O'Brien from McGlynn Elementary School and Mr. Nick Tucci from the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8317.796s">I</a> think you just need to turn on your microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8320.116s">It</a> should light up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8320.776s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8321.217s">Oh,</a> I think John did it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8323.397s">Now</a> it's off again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8324.037s">It's</a> off again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8326.698s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8330.905s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8331.605s">Oh,</a> no.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8969.041s">Any</a> other questions for Mr. O'Brien? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8970.703s">Thank</a> you, sorry about that button. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=8977.287s">Mr.</a> Tucci.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9711.0s">Mr.</a> Tucci, I think your microphone went off. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9713.863s">I</a> don't know if your thumb is just getting tired or if we have another problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9718.306s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9719.547s">I</a> just wanted people to be able to hear you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9939.604s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9944.614s">Just</a> from the chair, for those of you who are watching, I just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Tucci for the work that he does to bring programs like screenagers, et cetera, to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9954.397s">I</a> do wish they were better attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9956.238s">So</a> maybe we need like a wine license or something for the evening to entice people to come or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9962.159s">But</a> the unique thing about the bullying presentation is it is available online for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9968.681s">So</a> if you missed it last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9971.162s">The</a> superintendent's Friday update did have information about how to access that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9975.827s">And</a> I found it to be really helpful just to listen to and actually made my kids listen to it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9981.793s">And</a> they were like, why are we listening to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9983.654s">And</a> I, so we had a nice discussion at dinner afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9987.078s">So</a> thank you for all of your work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=9989.14s">I</a> think member McLaughlin has a question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10052.951s">Are</a> there any other questions for Mr. Tucci before we let him get on with his evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10058.475s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10064.298s">Item</a> number three, we have a request to approve the school year 24-25 draft school calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10069.922s">Motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10072.103s">There's</a> a motion to table on the floor by member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10077.295s">Is</a> there a second?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10091.863s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10093.184s">Second.</a>  <a

href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10114.915s">Okay,</a> motion is tabled until the next meeting on 12.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10120.419s">Um,</a> we do not have any presentations of the public tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10124.221s">Um,</a> and, uh, but we do have a number of resolutions that have been put forward by, uh, by members, including a, uh, first reading of a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10133.784s">So</a> before we do that, I just want to reiterate what our public participation policy is pursuant to the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10142.808s">Any</a> resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10148.462s">The</a> speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10152.007s">The</a> speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10157.895s">A</a> welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10163.001s">We</a> ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10166.343s">Employees</a> of the Medford Public Schools are exempt from the residency requirement of this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10170.485s">The</a> voice of our employees is welcomed on all matters before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10173.926s">When</a> a non-Medford resident employee is participating in public comment or submitting a presentation of the public, they will include their home address and identify themselves as an employee of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10185.111s">So</a> under continued business, we have 2023-25 offered by member Hays, member McLaughlin and member Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10192.509s">It</a> is the first reading of a policy which is ACA-1, non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10199.5s">So</a> you're going to have to bear with me because there's a lot of reading here, which I'm happy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10204.276s">But</a> before I start, I just want to make sure that for those of you listening and watching, this policy was presented at our last school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10212.865s">At</a> that time, we talked about a variety of members having questions and comments about the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10220.152s">We</a> then subsequently held a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10223.795s">and</a> made substantial edits to the policy and ultimately favorably and unanimously moved this policy back to the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10233.258s">So</a> it's here for its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10235.998s">So</a> I'm gonna start reading and I do believe that we should read the entire thing in its first reading and then we will look for a motion afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10247.799s">So</a> I'll start Medford public schools is committed to me committed to maintaining an educational environment and workplace for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sex, sexual orientation or gender expression is not tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10260.351s">The</a> school district does not and will not discriminate on the basis of gender identity, sex, sexual orientation or gender expression in the educational programs and activities of the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10269.997s">and</a> strives to create an environment where all students and staff feel safe, welcomed, and included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10275.903s">Medford</a> Public Schools takes allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously and will respond promptly to complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10281.309s">Where</a> it is determined that an inappropriate conduct has occurred, Medford Public Schools will act promptly to eliminate the conduct and will impose corrective action as necessary, including disciplinary action where appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10292.042s">To</a> help create a safe and supportive environment for all students, the school district will, consistent with the applicable laws and guidance, adhere to the below outlined policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10301.205s">Section</a> one is definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10303.125s">Medford</a> Public Schools will maintain a list of definitions in support of this policy on the district website and will maintain a list of definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10310.56s">will</a> maintain the list of definitions on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10313.841s">Item</a> number two, privacy, confidentiality, and student records. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10317.623s">Under</a> state law, information about a student's assigned birth gender, name change for gender identity purposes, gender transition, medical or mental health treatment related to gender identity, or any other information of similar nature, regardless of its form, is part of the individual student record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10334.249s">There</a> are two hyperlinks to <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10337.997s">the</a> Department of Education and the Massachusetts Students Records Regulation in the body of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10346.645s">Medford</a> Public Schools will ensure that all information in relation to students' gender identity shall be kept confidential in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10356.135s">Information</a> that may reveal a student's gender identity to others will not be disclosed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10362.625s">With</a> regard to changes to the student record, unless the school is legally required to do so, student records regulation 603 CMR 23.01 states that these rights shall be the rights of the student upon, and there's four conditions, upon reaching 14 years of age or upon reaching ninth grade, whichever comes first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10383.988s">Bullet</a> number two, if a student is under the age of 14 and has not yet entered ninth grade, these rights shall belong to the student's caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10394.193s">Bullet</a> number three, if a student is between 14 and 17 years of age or has entered ninth grade, both the student and his or her caregivers or either one acting alone shall exercise these rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10407.832s">Bullet</a> number four, if a student is 18 years of age or older, he or she alone shall exercise these rights subject to the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10414.537s">Caregivers</a> may continue to exercise rights until expressly limited by the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10420.422s">Section</a> three, gender markers on student records. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10424.611s">A</a> gender marker is the designation on school and other records that indicates a student's gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10429.112s">For</a> transgender students, a documented gender marker, for example, male or female on a permanent record, should reflect the student's gender identity, not the student's assigned sex. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10439.035s">Upon</a> request by the student, or in the case of students under the age of 14, or has not yet entered ninth grade, young students not yet able to advocate for themselves, requested by the caregivers, the school should change the gender marker on the record for transgender students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10455.276s">In</a> addition, transgender students who transition after having completed high school may ask their previous schools to amend school records or diploma or transcript that includes the student's birth name and gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10466.903s">When</a> requested and when satisfied with the gender identity information provided, schools should amend the student's record, including reissuing a high school diploma or transcript to reflect the student's name and current name and gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10479.932s">Section</a> four, names and pronouns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10482.967s">Medford</a> Public Schools recognizes that every student has the right to choose and be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the gender identity they consistently assert while at school, regardless of the student's assigned birth gender and names that appear on the student's birth certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10498.564s">Court</a> orders are not required to update student records to reflect changes <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10502.768s">in</a> a student's name or gender markers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10505.051s">According</a> to DESE, Massachusetts law recognizes common law name changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10510.497s">Any</a> individual may adopt a name that is different from the name that appears on his or her birth certificate provided the change of name is done for an honest reason with no fraudulent intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10521.509s">Nothing</a> more formal than usage is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10524.965s">end</a> quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10526.206s">Schools</a> will work with the student and the caregivers if they are involved in the process or in the case of a younger student with the student and the student's caregivers to develop a plan for communicating any name and pronoun change within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10539.396s">Item</a> five, transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10541.877s">The</a> decision about whether or how to undergo social and or medical gender transition is personal and depends on the unique circumstances of each individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10550.103s">There</a> is no threshold medical or mental health diagnosis or treatment requirement <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10554.52s">that</a> any student must meet in order to have his or her gender identity recognized and respected by a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10561.363s">When</a> the school is informed of a student's transition, the school shall hold a meeting with the student and caregivers of the student if they're involved in the process, or in the case of a younger student, with the student and the student's caregivers to develop a transition plan to provide a safe and supportive educational environment for students and to address any concerns that may arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10582.008s">The</a> primary goal of MPS will be to facilitate the relationship between the student and primary caregivers wherever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10588.452s">However,</a> some transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly so at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10596.738s">School</a> personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student's gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student's caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10605.164s">For</a> the same reasons, school personnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer to the student <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10611.167s">example,</a> appropriate pronoun use and written communication to the students' caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10616.412s">Section</a> six. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10619.755s">Last</a> section, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10623.879s">All</a> students are entitled to have access to restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities that are sanitary, safe, and adequate so that they can comfortably and fully engage in their school program and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10633.732s">Students</a> in Medford Public Schools will have access to the restroom, locker room, and changing facility that corresponds to their gender identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10639.995s">Transgender</a> and gender nonconforming students who are uncomfortable using a sex segregated restroom, locker room, or changing facility should be provided with safe and adequate alternatives, such as private changing areas, designated gender neutral restrooms, single stall gender neutral restrooms, or a nurse's or main office restroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10659.004s">However,</a> under no circumstances will a student be required <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10662.389s">to</a> use gender neutral facilities because they are transgender or non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10667.791s">So</a> this is a new policy and we've set the frequency for review to be every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10673.894s">And</a> there are a series of legal references that follow the policy that I am not going to read tonight because it's a bunch of hyperlinks and those are best looked at online. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=10691.255s">questions</a> from the committee. <a

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11362.907s">And</a> the process for students who are feeling uncomfortable in any way about anything is that they should be bringing those concerns to their assistant principal at the high school or their teacher at the elementary school, middle school is probably an assistant principal type as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11392.465s">So</a> we have we have did we just take we did we just take the vote we did we did not take the vote yet so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11399.591s">The</a> process is that new policies are read twice in committee, so this is the first reading substantial changes were made in subcommittee we actually didn't have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11410.589s">input</a> by the public at that publicly held meeting, which was, I think, on November 15th, if I'm remembering correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11418.295s">So</a> the first reading is tonight, and we will take a roll call vote to determine whether the first reading passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11426.122s">Then</a> there is a second reading of the policy, but this body has the power to pass policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11433.087s">That</a> is one of the four things explicitly that we are here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11437.388s">Yes,</a> this body will make the decision about whether this policy goes into effect or not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11448.093s">I</a> would direct them to the school principal wherever their child is so that they can have a conversation about the concerns for their own child. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11458.097s">And</a> we want, again, we want <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11460.919s">all</a> students to feel safe and welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11462.5s">And</a> that includes children who are transgender, who are non-conforming, who have questions about what is happening around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11472.166s">That</a> is always the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11473.286s">So</a> I would strongly encourage you to bring these concerns to your building principal, and they have processes and procedures to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11482.672s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11482.852s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11483.392s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11484.253s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11487.398s">Seeing</a> no other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=11489.72s">Member</a> Ruseau, roll call vote, please.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12037.659s">Well,</a> the March 1st deadline was just to really, I think, do some thinking through the process and norms around handbook review, because we've not done that as a district for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12047.764s">And</a> I think these are the good kind of questions that probably need some consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12053.067s">And</a> so the intent of the March 1st deadline was that our ad hoc committee process will be completed and we'll have some answers about these kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12062.392s">But</a> then by May 1st, I think as amended, we would need you <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12067.896s">we</a> would need you to provide all the handbooks to us so that we can then do that review starting on May 1st and in time for the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12075.519s">So</a> I think that ad hoc process to establish like the process and norms is where some of these like finer details can be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12085.443s">But</a> also I'm in favor of a May 1st date for you to turn over the handbooks to us for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12090.945s">That's</a> totally fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12092.345s">So</a> I would make a motion as amended and seconded by member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12098.056s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12099.917s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12101.498s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12105.921s">2023-27</a> offered by member Hays, member McLaughlin, and member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12109.224s">Ad</a> hoc report request on the bullying curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12112.226s">Whereas</a> the Medford Public Schools bullying and intervention plan states that NPS will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying prevention to students as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12120.083s">be</a> it resolved that MPS administration will provide a presentation to update the community about the curriculum and lessons used at each grade level to explicitly teach students the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12131.513s">Number</a> one, how to understand what bullying looks like and sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12134.775s">Number</a> two, how to identify bullying when it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12137.337s">And</a> number three, how to understand when verbal bullying becomes hate speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/2myy3HykAAc&t=12143.242s">Member</a> Hays or Member McLaughlin, would you like to speak on this?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=870.016s">Oh,</a> hi.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=875.54s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=875.96s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1187.841s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1189.482s">I</a> was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about, it looks like you're recommending changes to some existing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1197.448s">Can</a> you tell us where this policy exists?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1215.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1218.689s">Super</a> helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1219.71s">As</a> you were talking, I was thinking that I don't, didn't recall we had a homework policy at the school committee level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1230.62s">In</a> fact, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1233.382s">And</a> so I think this is, I think this gets confused and I think this will come up again when we talk about backpacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1239.768s">There</a> are school committee policies <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1242.41s">And</a> then there are like all the other policies that sit in your handbook that you all look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1247.514s">And</a> so the way like these things are supposed to work is that the school committee sets out a policy, all the buildings have to comply with that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1257.682s">So</a> those policies we try to make them <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1260.718s">such</a> that they set real high-level policy that then gets interpreted by all the various different levels and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1271.663s">So</a> our dress code policy is a good example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1275.244s">There</a> might be some things that clarify things for high school students that would be different for elementary school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1281.047s">So</a> in this case, I think we actually have two pieces of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1285.85s">One</a> is that we have to look at our school committee homework policy, because that has to sort of sit over the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1294.516s">And</a> then everything that, in the case where there is a policy, anything that's reflected in the school handbook has to be in alignment with what the school committee puts forward as its district-wide policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1309.065s">In</a> the case where there is no policy in the school committee handbook, in the school committee set of policies, then the superintendent and the principals, right, they are free to set their own policies on everything else that happens in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1327.196s">The</a> trick is, or the catch is, that what is supposed to happen once a handbook is created, and of course there's always been a handbook, but on an annual basis, those handbooks are supposed to be modified at the school level by the school site councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1347.753s">which</a> I think you all are allowed to be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1350.295s">And</a> then they go to the school committee essentially for like a sign off, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1355.099s">So,</a> and that sign off would look at things like, are we being consistent across both middle schools or are we consistent with our set of policies? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1363.686s">So,</a> I think there's actually like maybe a couple of pieces of work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1368.109s">One</a> is that the school committee needs to revisit its homework policy because we have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1375.159s">And</a> I can't tell when it was last. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1379.855s">updated,</a> but certainly not in four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1384.297s">And</a> there's been a lot of discussion about homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1386.098s">So</a> I think at a broad district level, like we have some work that we have to do at that policy level that we would love for you all to be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1394.782s">And</a> we can talk about how that can like come through its process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1399.364s">But</a> then sort of the second step of that is like whatever the homework policy is in your handbook, <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1405.76s">has</a> to be modified by the site council at the school, and obviously has to line up and then come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1413.243s">So,</a> and then, you know, I think about that process, which sounds like really complicated to your point, like there's lots of pieces of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1421.307s">But</a> I think there's, there'll be a lot of people who will want to weigh in on establishing homework policy, like your teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1431.303s">among</a> others, but I think parents as well, especially when you talk about kids of younger grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1435.404s">So</a> I think there's maybe a couple of steps here, which is one for us to look at your policy that you are suggesting and compare it to what is already our policy, which probably nobody realizes we have because we don't do a great job of that and get our policy sort of squared away in an alignment for K to 12 for the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1460.29s">And</a> then also there's probably some work that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1462.611s">Cabral</a> needs to do with her site council to sort of be more granular about like how to adhere to the spirit of that like overarching policy in a way that is specific to what happens at Medford High, which obviously you all have the most homework of all the grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1483.84s">And</a> so in the structure of how you learn is just very different than you would in first grade or fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1491.346s">So</a> there's probably like a couple of pieces here to me that I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1496.229s">I'm</a> happy to put forward a resolution that we look at the homework policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1500.192s">And</a> I would want to do that in a way that you all can join us for those conversations, because I think you've already done some good work, and perhaps there's lots of pieces that we can pull in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1512.121s">But</a> then there's that second piece, which is within the building, you all probably have some work to do, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1517.945s">Cabral,</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1519.406s">So</a> just some thoughts about homework in general, especially given that we have a policy that we also have to contend with in our overall policy handbook.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1552.99s">But</a> I love it and that you all are bringing forward a suggestion to us because a lot of times people will tell us they don't like something, but telling us how you think we can solve the problem is also super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1569.179s">So</a> thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1572.021s">Yes,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1816.847s">And</a> then before we do that, though, can I just I just want to point out, because there's been a lot of questions about whose policy this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1826.375s">There</a> is no school committee policy that references backpacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1829.418s">So</a> we so this particular question doesn't have two layers to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1834.823s">So</a> that's good news, because it's less layers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1838.946s">Our</a> school committee policies are silent on backpacks, somewhere along the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1844.005s">The</a> handbook has some language about what the backpack policy is at Medford High, and if that needs to be changed again like the school committee will sign off and approve those things, but in the absence of a policy at the school committee level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1860.666s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Vincent and her designees like Principal Cabral have the latitude to sort of issue policy directives or procedure directives like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1871.351s">So</a> obviously at some point we have to review these policies and I actually think we'll talk about that at our next meeting in terms of a timeline there because we have not reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1882.868s">uh,</a> handbooks in four years that I've been on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1885.51s">So</a> that is like bad hygiene, like in terms of all of these things continuing to work together well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=1891.055s">Um,</a> but I just wanted to make sure that the students knew that there is no school committee policy, that that policy does sit at Medford High, um, just as a jumping off point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2216.506s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2216.946s">I</a> just wanted to say that I think that all of your questions about why this policy exists are completely rational. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2224.167s">And</a> I hope the school council will really take a look at some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2228.988s">My</a> daughter says she's late every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2232.109s">from</a> one class to another because it's not possible, even without going to a locker, it's not even possible to get from point A to point B unless you're like a star track runner and there's no one in your way, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2243.398s">So</a> the schedule is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2247.18s">And</a> for the size of building so the size of building isn't going to change just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2253.548s">But</a> we are actively working on our scheduling and so hopefully we can be accounting for that as we're working with the scheduling folks who are there to help us figure out like how to make the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2267.202s">more</a> workable between the vocational side of the house and the comprehensive side of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2273.567s">So</a> I'm hoping that that also can be taken into account that we can't be marking students late if they can't physically get from point A to point B on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2283.294s">But</a> I think to the larger point of inconsistency, I would encourage you all to ask <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2292.677s">how</a> your principal, how to let her and her team know about these inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2298.739s">Because</a> when you're talking about 150 adults in the building, I don't think anyone's got it out for anybody, but 150 humans will make 150 different decisions without the right guidance about what to do when various things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2317.006s">I</a> think the question, you know, the questions for the site council are like, how do we promote consistency? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2322.29s">How</a> can the schedule help us? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2323.631s">And</a> then I think the third question for the site council for me is like, it's 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2329.376s">Do</a> you need a binder? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2330.777s">Like,</a> do you need to be carrying a giant binder around? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2333.6s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2334.68s">Like,</a> I've <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2335.641s">said</a> no to binders my whole life and I'm still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2338.863s">But</a> instructionally speaking and from a curriculum perspective, are there alternatives that like would alleviate this problem as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2348.868s">Because</a> just being like even if you could carry a backpack and you had to carry five binders with you, like that doesn't even really seem like a solution to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2356.311s">So</a> I'm hopeful that you all will get a chance to weigh in on that with Principal Cabral. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2361.634s">Because</a> I think there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2364.212s">things</a> that are possible to fix this problem that have very little, honestly, to do with whether backpacks exist or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TI4RwUcsbmY&t=2372.576s">So</a> just think about what's possible, and I would encourage you to really push on that.<h2><a href="../2023-11-02_f9NpRcOkIx4/2023-11-02_f9NpRcOkIx4.html">MSC - Committee of the Whole - Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity 11.01.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1038.015s">I'm</a> just a point of order, I would like somebody to pull up the policy so that as we're going through this, we can actually look at what we're talking about because as it stands, it sounds like we're all commenting on a policy we haven't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1051.848s">Because</a> some changes have been made, and I don't think that's like the. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1057.233s">most</a> effective way to get through this policy, but I would rather we take it section by section and field the questions and make live edits as we're going, so that at the end of this, we all know what the policy says, so that its final, its next reading can be its last. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1076.681s">But</a> if we're not going to see a copy of this until the next meeting, then it's going to be really hard to accomplish that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1204.471s">Oh,</a> I was just going to wait for the superintendent to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1207.393s">I</a> have several comments, but I think if we're going to go from the top of the policy, like section by section, I think we should just all hold our comments until we can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1347.614s">I</a> have some questions on sections before that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1350.776s">Okay,</a> I do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1361.764s">I</a> have a question about the definitions section. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1364.306s">So</a> my <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1372.957s">My.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1375.384s">I</a> would make a motion that we strike this section from the policy because as even it describes like everything, these definitions and terminology evolve constantly and instead put in the policy that the district will maintain a set of definitions in support of this policy on the Medford Public Schools website that is updated on an annual basis so that <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1404.864s">the</a> responsibility for like the management of that change is happening on a regular and routine basis and is not sort of trapped in policy, because it does change all the time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1438.294s">Sure,</a> the motion is to remove the definition section from this document and instead include language that Medford Public Schools will maintain a list of definitions in support of this policy on the district website that's maintained by district personnel on an annual basis.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1498.658s">Mayor,</a> the second motion I have is that everywhere where we say parents, guardians, caregivers, all the policy work we've been doing has been trying to standardize some of the language across our policy base. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1511.828s">And</a> we are using the phrase caregivers to be all encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1516.611s">So</a> I would just make a motion that anywhere where we say parents, guardians, caregivers, it just be amended to say caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1523.656s">And</a> that's like, again, a global policy issue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1535.623s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1636.768s">Not</a> until this point in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1638.509s">So</a> I think the next section says is about transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1644.534s">I</a> don't have any comments about transitions, but perhaps others do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=1753.426s">I</a> did share it with all members so that they can... I think it's up higher and there's a section right under the definitions called transitions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2317.104s">Sure,</a> so my original comment was just to say, I'm fine with this section exactly as it is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2324.53s">I</a> don't think it actually needs revision. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2327.693s">But</a> I think to member Rousseau's point, I think what he's talking about are really implementation questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2335.039s">And</a> so I do think what we need to do when we enact this policy is that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2344.367s">have</a> a motion that enacts the policy and directs the administration to advise us if there are things that are needed in order to enact this policy like with integrity and fidelity and what those things are by some date certain so that we can be informed if there are things that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2368.386s">in</a> support of the policy and acknowledge that if we're going to say this policy is effective immediately, that there is an implementation phase, there is an implementation period where <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2380.208s">we're</a> implementing, which I'm fine with, but I think that's, to me, the solution to the real questions that member Rousseau is raising, which is they really are implementation questions and they're super important, but I don't wanna bog down the work on this policy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2398.04s">Instead,</a> I wanna pass the policy and give clear direction to the superintendent about what our expectations are so that she can then advise us what those needs are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2866.613s">Looks</a> like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2867.954s">Oh,</a> is that what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2869.475s">Hold</a> on, let me share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2870.716s">I</a> can direct you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2874.179s">I</a> am.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2886.469s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2888.454s">Okay,</a> so I just added some page numbers here so that we can direct people accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2892.935s">So</a> there's two places, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2895.476s">So</a> privacy, confidentiality and student records uses students assigned birth sex. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2901.337s">And</a> under gender markers, we use students birth name and gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=2907.378s">And</a> so I think the question is, it should be consistent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3131.965s">Does</a> somebody have a, which hyperlink is it that I should be putting in here?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3161.795s">Can</a> you put it in the chat for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3163.938s">I'll</a> look for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3165.761s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3178.302s">So</a> can I just ask a point of order question before we continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3182.783s">Do</a> we want to be going through this sequentially or do we want to hop around? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3188.284s">Because</a> I feel like members of those comments are moving all around the document and I just don't want everybody to be doing different things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3323.894s">Are</a> there other comments about the transitions section?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3423.772s">Oh,</a> is it on paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3425.032s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3427.853s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3428.733s">Um,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3429.293s">So</a> where does it go? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3430.333s">Member</a> Hays?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3444.976s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3445.736s">Oh,</a> found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3448.456s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3449.576s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3482.082s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3482.502s">Can</a> you say that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3485.964s">I</a> feel like I'm in typing class.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3695.714s">Like</a> that, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3750.109s">I</a> would personally put that in the student records section because that's what you're sort of referring to here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3767.079s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3798.226s">I</a> might suggest we put it with the student record and then move the student record piece and the privacy and confidentiality piece up to the top.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3848.653s">And</a> then like this whole section would go here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3853.695s">So</a> it sets the sort of sets the stage for everything that follows.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3907.748s">And</a> then I'm just thinking that then this, this can be deleted because we cover it in like the more explicit detail here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=3927.835s">So</a> we cover what happens at each age rather than saying like younger students and here's what happens.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=4774.852s">Can</a> you read that again so I can?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=4819.82s">Can</a> you read it one more time?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=4858.783s">Okay,</a> and member Hays, where were you thinking this belonged at the top of this section?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5007.297s">We</a> want to take a vote on the updates to the transitions section as displayed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5240.686s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5241.146s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5241.386s">I</a> remember I remember Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5283.229s">Before</a> you do that, I would like to suggest that we move this section so that it goes with our records stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5294.413s">So</a> we talk about privacy, confidentiality, student records, and then we talk about gender markers and student records. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5301.916s">So</a> it's all in the same place in the policy, and then it goes from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5307.439s">So</a> it would look like that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5354.213s">I've</a> lost the place in my two screens here where I can raise my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5358.416s">So</a> just put my hand there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5362.958s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that we strike this section because in the policy, the rules and policy subcommittee, we are completely revamping the wellness policy that has, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5380.448s">much</a> of this same content in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5384.311s">And</a> we're like halfway through that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5387.613s">And</a> I am concerned that if we're doing this stuff in two places, like they are going to be in conflict with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5395.658s">So</a> my preference would be that when we talk about physical education classes and intramural and interscholastic athletic activities under the wellness policy, that it is all inclusive of all things <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5409.52s">physical</a> education, intramural, athletic, and that this language can just be sort of sent over there as like an infusion into that policy, which is in process.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5430.504s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5431.844s">Motion</a> to strike this and send it to the wellness policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5450.914s">I</a> think it's, I think we are like well documented in our <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5460.896s">inability</a> to maintain current policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5463.297s">Like</a> it's just, it's a lot, it's a lot of work and we're woefully behind, like we're working as fast as we can, but here we are and we still have like an entire policy book that hasn't been reviewed in decades maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5480.62s">So</a> that's like, for me, that's one reason that I think that this belongs, it's more of like a hygiene issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5489.522s">The</a> other reason I think it belongs there is because I don't want students to feel like they have to go to a special place to learn about the policy for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5505.003s">So</a> if we're gonna have a policy, and I will have the same comment about dress code. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5510.205s">If</a> we're gonna have a policy that covers physical education, it should cover physical education for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5516.708s">It</a> shouldn't be like, yeah, but then if you're this kind of student, you have to go here to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5521.33s">Like</a> that to me doesn't feel inclusive or protective. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5527.953s">And</a> I want our students to feel like they're all <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=5532.836s">you</a> know, part of the same team, essentially, when they're thinking about how the rules apply to them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6081.787s">And</a> I would say that our dress code policy is more broad than this because we worked hard to be not at all gendered when we wrote the dress code policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6094.738s">So</a> this is actually like a little more like prescriptive about <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6101.064s">what</a> we allow and what we don't allow, then our dress code policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6103.705s">Our</a> dress code policy is much more broad than this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6243.629s">Before</a> it's not cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6244.85s">It's</a> not complete yet, so we can incorporate this there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6385.033s">I</a> think it's not what happens today. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6387.514s">It's</a> what happens in six months or a year when something gets reopened and it changes and it diverges and nobody realizes that there was something else that had to be done to keep them in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6398.777s">Like,</a> I think aspirationally, those things should not be hard, but I don't think that as a district, that's where we are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6419.182s">I</a> think that's where we have to trust that the members of the school committee who are elected by the city to represent students would not leave something like this on the cutting room floor in a policy revision.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f9NpRcOkIx4&t=6698.421s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2023-10-17_5dIZAL7mP78/2023-10-17_5dIZAL7mP78.html">10.16.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=48.981s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=49.301s">Member</a> Bistow? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=50.182s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3491.843s">Just</a> a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3494.143s">Is</a> there a time of day that you are targeting for these meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3499.424s">So</a> we'll be meeting monthly with the students after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3501.665s">But</a> these dates that are on our.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3521.212s">Is</a> there a time of day that would work best for students? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3524.334s">I</a> mean, I think just practically speaking, if it's going to be inside the school day, there's going to be some finagling on our end to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3533.578s">So</a> if we could be least disruptive to students, given that we have to do that to our schedules anyway, I think I would be fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3541.721s">I</a> don't know if there's a good time or a bad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3544.302s">Yeah,</a> I don't know enough about the high school schedule to know is there some magical space where <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3550.734s">it's</a> not pulling them out of classes or what have you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3587.371s">So,</a> in terms of the dates proposed, I am fine with all those dates except for the January date. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3593.074s">That's</a> not a date that I will be able to be there at but all the rest are fine for me and I think we just need to make sure that we post the meeting and they <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3609.461s">if</a> other members of the community want to join us, they know how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3613.463s">But</a> so, if the committee wants to keep that January 17th date, I I'm totally fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3621.526s">I</a> just I definitely know that I can't be there and I also know that there will be at least three new members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3628.969s">So,</a> I don't wanna make promises on behalf of people who can't tell us about their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3634.591s">So,</a> that's my other sort of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3636.051s">I</a> don't know how we work <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3638.871s">decide</a> on what the dates are because otherwise, you know, it's going to be really hard to manage the execution of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3872.051s">Oh,</a> I can't see it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3878.133s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3879.513s">So</a> I think, to me, there's a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3883.034s">If</a> we are going to have an officially posted school committee meeting, there has to be a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3889.396s">And</a> so I think we do need to orchestrate whether <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3893.615s">there</a> are in fact four members of the committee who can be at each of these meetings because if they're not, we can still hold the meetings, but they get held differently and they are not publicly posted meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3906.103s">But</a> if we post a meeting, there has to be a quorum in order for the meeting to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3910.806s">So</a> we can't post a meeting and just have three people show up because then we can't have the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3916.43s">So</a> I think there needs to be a little bit of orchestration around <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3919.676s">who</a> is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3921.117s">And</a> I think that will drive like exactly how the meeting can happen on our end. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3927.441s">But</a> I think also like if there is a posted meeting, it would be helpful if the students could sort of identify a set of topics that they want to talk to us about so that those can be posted on an agenda if we're having an official meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3942.23s">The</a> other thing I would suggest is we can hold a Zoom meeting and then there's no requirement for the high school to be unlocked, which creates other safety issues and concerns, but the students could certainly join from a common place to our meeting on Zoom, as long as the meeting is posted to be an exclusively Zoom oriented meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3963.644s">So</a> I think there are some options there that don't require us to open the high school to be in compliance with the law, the open meeting law, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3973.309s">Because</a> we are allowed to host meetings on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3975.55s">And</a> I think we as a body need to be clear about who is able to join each meeting because that will drop that should drive and set the like rules of engagement around making sure that we can actually have a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3990.276s">And</a> that will happen differently based on how many of us are able to join at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3995.558s">So</a> I think we need to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3998.208s">you</a> know, we can certainly talk about the November meeting because all of us here are the folks that have to be available for that November meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4005.171s">Um</a> but I think we probably just need to have another conversation about those meetings as they come up so that we have the right rules in place for everybody.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5397.949s">I</a> have a bunch of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5399.911s">So,</a> I'm going to apologize in advance that I did not get an email to the superintendent before today but I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5407.857s">Um</a> if um if she would like afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5411.28s">Um</a> to member Hays's point like I'm I am supportive of expecting to or being able to see how various schools are performing and of course like <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5423.402s">we</a> understand that there are different programs in different places, we get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5428.084s">But</a> I think if we're talking about growth, like we would wanna be seeing growth among all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5435.566s">And</a> I think the other thing I would like to see is a much more like cohesive visual of how we did against the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5449.695s">The</a> goal because last year it was really difficult and I think if I can recall like I don't think we made I don't think we hit the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5460.238s">Or</a> we hit it in some places and not in others, and it was incredibly difficult as somebody who is like sitting down to say, did you meet expectations, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5471.434s">Whether</a> you did or you didn't and I part of it was because like we've got this just big pile of information and there wasn't an agreed upon like way that we will see this information in some sort of like one page summary form that says like. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5488.424s">We</a> did it or we didn't by these measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5490.825s">And</a> so I think it would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5494.106s">Well,</a> before we are talking about the evaluation to come up with what that like dashboard looks like for lack of a better term so that we can all say, yeah, we agree that this point of view of the data is going to give us what we need to be able to like understand like <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5510.799s">Where</a> did we meet this goal, this literacy goal? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5513.76s">Where</a> did we not? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5515.12s">And</a> did we in the aggregate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5516.981s">Because</a> I think that's always the hard part. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5518.722s">It's</a> like, well, you did and you did here, you didn't there, you did here, you did here, you didn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5523.503s">And</a> like, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5525.384s">So</a> I think it would be helpful for us to agree on that upfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5529.025s">So</a> that would be the design of that would certainly be an outcome that I think would be very, very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5536.357s">Also</a> from a literacy perspective, I guess, you know, one question that I had is like, I don't feel like we talked about dibbles last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5543.301s">I</a> could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5545.062s">Um,</a> but if we're saying we want 90% of students to make a 10%, um, jump, what, what did they do last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5552.946s">Did</a> we like, is that, do we already do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5556.228s">And</a> we should be like pushing you to do something more than 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5560.791s">Like</a> what, so what is the baseline? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5562.752s">Like,</a> where are we starting? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5563.913s">It's</a> hard to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5565.08s">This</a> is a good sort of aggressive but realistic goal without knowing like where are we right now from a DIBLS perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5601.752s">And</a> I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5602.993s">I'm</a> sort of envisioning there's like a revision of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5605.874s">So</a> I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5607.854s">So</a> I just, I more wanna know like, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5610.799s">We,</a> I want you to have goals that are attainable but also like are pushing the district forward and if we're like if we're already at 90 90% 90% of students meeting 10% like that's not a push that's not a goal that's going to push us forward right if we're already if that's sort of what we have been doing all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5631.801s">don't</a> think you don't need to have the answer right now but I think that's the information like I would need to feel comfortable that that is a goal where we're saying we're really pushing the the needle forward here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5642.347s">So,</a> from a from a student learning goal, those, that was all my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5647.21s">I</a> actually had quite a number of thoughts about the district improvement goal as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5651.953s">So,</a> I don't know, mayor, if you want me to go through them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5662.107s">There's</a> a series of things that I think are missing from this goal, either as an action or an outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5669.378s">and</a> I'll try to run through them and I promise to send you an email as well, but I would like to see a commitment to a timely budget process that's thoughtful, comprehensive, and timely because we struggle with that every single year no matter what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5683.804s">We</a> passed a resolution a few weeks ago about an excessive heat protocol, so I would like to see that be listed as <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5691.952s">a</a> key action that the development of that protocol is completed and implemented and that we could see it in action if there were another excessive heat day. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5702.621s">We</a> also are in the middle of looking at new schedules for the middle school or revised schedules for the middle school and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5710.507s">So</a> I would like to be able to see that we're ready to implement those things at the start of the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5715.711s">I</a> would also like to see evidence that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5722.46s">implemented</a> the the bullying policy that we just passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5727.123s">Um</a> because I think that policy implementation is a concern that I have just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5732.767s">Um</a> but that was a really big important change. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5736.729s">Um</a> and I wanna I I don't have a thought off the top of my head about like how would we know it's being implemented but I think that's the question for you to <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5750.666s">And</a> then I just have a couple more things I can like move quickly because I'm going to send you an email if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5757.468s">I</a> would also like to see there be a specific outcome that ties to the climate study that we're going to talk about in just a minute, where we are, you know, we started talking about that last time and we talked about the data there as a baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5771.272s">So</a> it's like a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5774.093s">And</a> if that's a starting point, we should be able to see and observe <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5779.072s">measurable</a> progress based on that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5781.694s">If</a> we are doing the work to improve the climate and culture so I think tying to some advancement of the of that survey however you know again I don't have a specific idea of how we do it but I would love to hear what. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5794.807s">your</a> team thinks about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5798.109s">I</a> would like to see something explicit that ties us to like a percentage of improvement in that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5804.332s">And</a> then two other things that are sort of on my mind, we've sort of danced around the idea that the strategic plan is expiring or done or sort of at the end of its term. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5817.245s">And</a> I would like for us to at least this year have a plan for how we're gonna go forward with the strategic plan that makes the plan about engagement of lots of audiences, which did not happen last time, and is really sort of the hallmark of a strategic plan to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5837.83s">So</a> I would like to see something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5841.07s">And</a> then the last thing that I will say, and then I will stop talking, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5844.497s">is</a> under number six where we talk about enhancing human resources practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5848.498s">I</a> think that's really critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5851.559s">I</a> would like to add and labor relations to this bullet number six under key actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5857.781s">I</a> am really, really concerned about the climate that we find ourselves in from a labor relations perspective with our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5869.693s">and</a> I would like to see us really intentionally chart a better path forward where we're operating with clarity and collaboration and just an overall feeling of teamwork and that from an HR perspective, we have good controls and procedures in place when it comes to labor relations issues and they will always happen no matter how well-functioning a district, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5894.734s">And</a> then I think from an outcomes perspective, I would like to see us, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5899.113s">complete</a> and execute and implement an employee handbook and I know we've talked about that and I think there's a draft floating around but I think it is well past time for us to have an employee handbook that outlines the rules of the road for everybody who is in our employ. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5915.206s">Okay,</a> that's my whole list. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5916.327s">I</a> will send you an email with all of those things on them but those are all things that I think would add some like real meat to this and and be relevant to like what we have in front of us as a district right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6787.518s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6788.158s">So,</a> I I agree that we need to be thoughtful about when we're asking for something that only the superintendent can do but I would also say that by and large, everything listed here is not something that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6804.414s">be</a> expecting the superintendent having to personally do the vast majority of everything I talked about I think everything I talked about tonight but also everything that's on here is really a reflection of the work of the district and this is, you know, the superintendent is the <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6818.55s">leader</a> of the district and so therefore, like sort of the district's goals have to to flow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6823.154s">I</a> would also point out that she has a rather large team of administrators underneath her. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6830.52s">We</a> hear lots of criticism actually about how large that team is in the community and I'm absolutely okay with the size of the of the support team both of the assistant superintendents and of all of our department directors and our <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6847.33s">our</a> our coordinators because we have a lot of work to do as a district that has not been done for a really long time and I do think, you know, that's just the reality that we have to operate in but it's, you know, it's it is not good enough to just say, well, we're behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6866.836s">So,</a> we're going to stay behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6868.896s">We</a> have to find some, we have to find ways <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6876.172s">you</a> know, growing set of challenges because our students deserve a district that isn't behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6883.915s">And</a> that is a huge tall order, but I'm glad that the superintendent has the team that she has between the assistant superintendents and the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6895.2s">There's</a> a lot of people working tirelessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6897.361s">And</a> I think, you know, one of the hallmarks of a good leader from my perspective is that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6903.143s">they</a> know how to delegate and support their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6906.045s">So</a> I'm hopeful that even though this is an ambitious set of goals that the superintendent, you know, really sits and plans thoughtfully with her team to delegate and make sure that everybody is working in lockstep with what these goals really are so that it can it can provide a sort of some fast forwarding of things that have been really slow to evolve here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6934.328s">and</a> that we can implement them with some consistency and fidelity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8214.196s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8214.637s">I</a> think that there is a category that's missing from this page. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8221.606s">I</a> went through and I, there's a category of questions in the survey called sense of belonging and it doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8229.793s">It</a> hasn't appeared under strengths buried or areas of growth, and it is different than school belonging, because I toggled back and forth to make sure that I understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8237.758s">There's</a> a lot of really good, interesting information in here, but it is missing what I would envision to be some sort of summary and guidance around what is favorable, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8253.52s">how</a> did students answer each of these questions in a favorable way, and what is that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8258.622s">And</a> I know we had some discussion about that in the last meeting, and I see that the favorability number has just been removed from this report, which I actually think makes it harder to digest the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8270.627s">I</a> just think it's important that we get it right in terms of what we talk about as favorable, so that when these questions are written in a positive manner, favorable is agree and strongly agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8283.621s">And</a> when they're written negatively, like Ben, the favorable numbers are the disagree and the strongly disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8289.023s">I</a> don't know to the extent that we can change the structure of the questions, whether that's an option, but it's, we're sort of tricking people, taking these things when we have like two scale, like competing scales like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8303.369s">So</a> I think from a survey administration perspective, if we have the opportunity to sort of right size the questions so that they all <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8312.742s">point</a> in the same direction, I think that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8317.525s">But</a> I also think it would be helpful for there to be like a one page summary of what is the list of questions in each of these categories and what was our ranking so that we can easily look somewhere without having to sort of dig through many, many pages and say, did we do better this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8335.797s">There</a> were some like really stark examples, both positive and negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8343.223s">that</a> I think just bear commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8350.708s">There</a> is a question about feeling like there are teachers who <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8360.643s">can</a> connect what I'm learning to life outside the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8364.164s">There's</a> comments, really favorable positive comments about teachers would know if I wasn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8371.847s">But</a> then there are some very particular questions about bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8375.569s">And</a> so to the point of like quantifying and evaluation, like there are really particular questions about bullying and those results are not as favorable in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8384.373s">But</a> I think the one that like made me the saddest for lots of reasons is that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8391.004s">When</a> we ask students the question, I think that students are proud of how the school looks on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8397.428s">Only</a> 14% of students agreed, and I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8402.852s">But</a> I think when we look at the questions around the way that we maintain our buildings, the students' voices are very clear that they want and expect more from us as a district than we're providing them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8421.006s">the</a> the there's a number of questions here and so I think this report is really like meaty and informative and very helpful but I think for the community to be able to sort of digest it all, it needs to be presented a bit differently than this so that it can guide people in understanding sort of in a consistent way what the what the results were and and frankly that we can sort of set a measure and say, we're going to do better next year and then we <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8450.762s">But</a> I think this was really informative and I know there's lots of people picking at various components of this from an implementation perspective and we have leadership and I'm really excited about all the energy that's going on at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8466.415s">I</a> think it's all really good and we'll tell a really great story at the end of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8471.5s">But</a> I do think at baseline, there's work to do on this report so that it can, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8477.186s">sort</a> of be a grounding place for us to start from. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8480.128s">And</a> I don't think the support is quite there yet, but I think it's pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8485.711s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13543.798s">Before</a> you read, can I just ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13547.02s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13547.22s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13550.97s">want</a> to say thank you to the folks who put this together because I think it's really important and I want to see us pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13558.992s">I</a> had some comments that are just more about sort of sustainability of our the policy itself and maybe some suggestions but I was just curious if the idea was that this could was going to go to subcommittee or how we want to navigate through this because it is <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13579.119s">very</a> long. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13580.78s">Um</a> and I just want to be mindful of the fact that it's already 905 and we have been at this since five o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13587.025s">So,</a> um II don't want to delay the implementation of the policy but I do think there are some things um that I'd like to see change slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13598.755s">So,</a> can we, maybe we can just talk about like proceed how we're going to navigate through this whether it's tonight or or some other time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13682.653s">Could</a> it, could there be a meeting with just one topic?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13687.703s">Oh,</a> one, I mean, a school committee just meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13690.284s">Just</a> like, could we have a committee of the whole or something with just one topic so it does not start at five and end at 10 sometime soon? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13699.608s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13701.189s">I</a> think I have some like sort of overarching comments that would require some changes to the policy, but they're not, I don't think they're particularly like problematic or changing the spirit of what is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13715.851s">it's</a> more about just I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13721.415s">Maintenance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13722.216s">Yeah,</a> we only have one meeting in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13723.697s">So,</a> I I just don't know if can we just sort of talk about what our thoughts are and maybe another iteration of this can come forward next time that we can pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13733.363s">I</a> don't I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13734.064s">I'm</a> not sure what the best path forward is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13943.884s">I</a> would also say maybe in the Doodle poll, we can figure out which committee members may have comments <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13949.841s">where</a> they feel like they need to be available for the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13953.022s">And</a> there are committee members who don't feel like they have comments and it doesn't work for their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=13958.004s">Like</a> we just know that so we can find a time that gets this prioritized.<h2><a href="../2023-10-12_95wursjg8MQ/2023-10-12_95wursjg8MQ.html">MSC Family & Community Engagement Subcommittee - 10.11.2023</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=43.49s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=44.711s">My</a> camera is not cooperating today. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=49.389s">It</a> just shows a brown screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=51.171s">I</a> don't know what's brown, but I will spare you the brown square and just leave my camera off, sadly, because that's how my day's been going.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=85.48s">I</a> can. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=85.9s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=86.3s">Okay,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=88.262s">I'm</a> going to go ahead and start the meeting and read the meeting notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=94.626s">Okay,</a> please be advised that on Wednesday, October 11, at 4pm, there will be a family engagement and communication subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=105.728s">The</a> meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast and Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=109.751s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in by using the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=114.275s">So,</a> https://nps02155-org.us slash j slash 988. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=131.308s">574-683-91.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=133.569s">If</a> you wanted to dial in, it's 1305-224-1968. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=140.734s">Questions</a> and comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing me, Jenny Graham, all one word at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=150.0s">If</a> you are planning to do that, please include your first and last name, your Medford street address and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=159.382s">So</a> I will start by calling the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=162.226s">Member</a> Kreatz.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=171.099s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=172.361s">And</a> Member Graham here. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=173.242s">So</a> we have three present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=176.116s">Our</a> agenda was set forward to us per our unanimous vote of the school committee on May 1st of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=186.38s">And</a> it reads, whereas the school committee seeks to increase transparency and community engagement, and whereas Medford Public Schools has recently relaunched its website on a modernized platform that enables regular maintenance, be it resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee meet to discuss updates to the website <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=203.046s">that</a> would promote family engagement, improve accessibility and ensure transparency for all MPS families and residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=210.269s">Be</a> it further resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee will invite Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=213.771s">Lisa</a> Miller and her students to work to launch the site and are currently working on plans for phase two of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=222.097s">Um,</a> so that is our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=223.578s">Um,</a> and, um, by way of background, uh, for everybody on the call, um, with us, we had a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=233.041s">Um,</a> I believe it was right before may 1st from miss Miller and the students that worked on the initial phase of the, um, the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=242.145s">And</a> during that meeting, um, what the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=247.987s">No,</a> I heard the ideas for what the next phase might look like of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=253.489s">And</a> so we wanted to have this discussion to really talk about sort of A, what is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=259.632s">So</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=260.792s">Miller</a> and her students are here and I want you to introduce everybody in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=265.214s">So</a> we wanna hear a little bit about what's possible and talk about what some of the ideas are amongst this subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=273.637s">And</a> we're actually also thrilled to have <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=276.658s">Mr.</a> Thomas Dalton with us who has joined us as the director of communications on behalf of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=282.503s">So</a> we're super excited to have you working with us on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=287.186s">So</a> Miss Miller, did you want to? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=290.909s">I</a> saw that you sent me a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=292.71s">Did</a> you want to start by introducing? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=296.393s">Yourself</a> and the team here so that we can hear a little bit about. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=302.618s">The</a> presentation you wanted to provide us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=355.137s">I</a> think go ahead and introduce, have everybody introduce themselves, and then I think we would love to hear from you all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=404.468s">We</a> are thrilled to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=405.648s">We</a> love having students in our subcommittee meetings and at our regular meetings, but these are a little bit easier for people to get to, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=413.792s">If</a> they have to go to bed and go to school the next day, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=418.393s">So</a> Superintendent, I don't know if you wanted to say anything before we turn it over to Miss Miller to do a presentation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1292.971s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1293.531s">Miller,</a> I will also check with my team here at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1298.695s">We</a> do a lot of build of e-learning content. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1302.678s">And</a> when you build <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1305.407s">those</a> kinds of resources, particularly for use in state government, the agencies are typically very interested in making sure there's section 508 compliance, which is all the things that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1319.192s">So</a> it's making sure that anybody who is needing to use that resource can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1326.134s">And</a> the sticky part about 508 compliance is that it is in the eye of the beholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1331.316s">So</a> there is no set of rules that says like, yes, check, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1335.297s">this</a> is 508 compliant, what you can do is you can sort of test for the things that are the most common. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1342.079s">Nope,</a> 508. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1343.539s">So</a> it's a set of standards that govern the sort of digital publication of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1354.742s">And</a> one of the things that state agencies grapple with certainly is when they're providing these kinds of <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1363.74s">whether</a> it's websites, whether it's e-learning, what have you, that they sort of have to take a best effort approach to cover as many bases of best practice as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1375.452s">And</a> then if there are individuals who require something particular, then the goal is to like <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1385.402s">individually</a> meet that person where they are, because there is no standard for what you need to be able to access the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1393.367s">So</a> a lot of times when we talk about 508 compliance, you know, there's there's sort of rules of the road, like you talked about, like <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1402.132s">making</a> sure a screen reader can read alt tags. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1404.835s">And</a> that takes a whole body of work, right, to alt tag everything, really be thoughtful about PDFs and things like that, color contrast, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1413.062s">There</a> is a best, there are like guidelines that sort of get you there probably like 90, 95, 96, 97% of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1422.21s">And</a> it's this website certainly sets up all of that very nicely, I think, to the to the sort of point in conversation around the information that you're receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1434.186s">I</a> do think there's probably an opportunity for us to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1440.814s">these</a> best practices in terms of what you need and how you need it to make life easier for everybody who's going to post things. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1449.18s">So,</a> I mean, you know, Tom is going to know these things, you're going to know these things, but somebody who's like, Hey, can you post this on the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1456.044s">Here's</a> a flyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1456.725s">Um,</a> even if they're able to give you like, here's the image and here's the details, like that makes it easier for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1462.749s">So</a> I think there probably are some standards to think about as this, as we talk about next iteration, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1470.814s">for</a> the team to put together to say hey if you're going to give us information here's here's how we would like you to give it to us and here's why because people would never you know most people would never think about like how would I describe this photo I just I'm looking at it right and so that take that's all a bunch of that's a body of work that has to happen in order to make this <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1494.667s">accessible</a> on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1496.569s">So</a> I think some of those like sort of ideas around like how you want to receive information would be really sort of helpful for all the people that are trying to feed you stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1507.826s">Tom?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1586.197s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1586.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1587.037s">I</a> appreciate that so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1590.699s">This</a> is such an evolution from where we were not that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1594.92s">So</a> we're like zooming light years ahead, which is really exciting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1599.482s">Remember</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1695.824s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1696.004s">Miller,</a> I think you have some additional slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1698.205s">We'll</a> stop interrupting you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2216.312s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2216.872s">Member</a> McLaughlin, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2228.977s">Um,</a> so I think we, when we brought this to the school committee, we definitely, um, were interested in exploring a little bit more about phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2238.921s">And</a> so I, um, and there were a couple of things that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2243.804s">Um,</a> sort of piqued my interest as you were talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2247.405s">Um,</a> and, and that I've heard about, um, and actually I invited, uh, miss Perry today as well, because I think we couple of things that we've heard at the school committee over. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2258.71s">the</a> course of this last year is that some of the athletic teams are like, they're sort of like out there on their own for a whole variety of reasons, sort of managing their own websites where they're like sort of posting all of their community right like their <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2277.941s">Their</a> track results their information for teams, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2283.764s">One</a> of the parents on the track team brought that to my attention that the track coach was like sort of maintaining this website on his own at his own expense and I, I certainly don't think that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2294.048s">sort</a> of asked him to do that, but I imagine that he did it at a time when our website was really not very functional and he wanted a way to sort of provide all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2303.432s">And</a> so that to me was one of the reasons why I invited Miss Perry is because I think all of the athletic teams and to <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2312.455s">to</a> Rachel's point earlier, our extracurriculars all have potentially the same sort of use case and need to be able to have a space that can sort of live underneath the auspices of our overall website and be nimble and easy enough for people to post, but still informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2336.639s">So</a> that we don't have, and one thing that does concern me from a <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2340.16s">sort</a> of security perspective is like we don't have people out on all kinds of websites all over the place posting information that may or may not conform to sort of the guidelines that we would use to manage our own internal website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2354.25s">So</a> one question I think I had for this group from a phase two perspective is <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2360.194s">Like,</a> is there an opportunity to take that as a body of work around athletics and the extracurriculars and figure out really a process by which those pages can exist and can exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2376.823s">with</a> the right like parameters and controls in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2379.985s">And</a> I wanted Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2381.426s">Perry</a> to be here for sure because obviously there are some tentacles there with athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2386.789s">So</a> I would just be interested in any thoughts that the team has around whether that is something that's viable for us to be thinking about as part of a phase two.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2530.543s">Thank</a> you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2531.264s">I</a> guess one of the things that I don't know a lot about from a final site perspective is whether there are integrations available that would make some of these connections easier so that everybody can sort of work in the native place that they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2548.156s">And</a> it doesn't have to be like so labor intensive to sort of move information to final sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2554.021s">So</a> in other words, like this final site have some sort of integration that would work with <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2558.806s">Is</a> it our school where all of the athletics work is happening and then can, is there some like more integrated way on the back end for the website to organically take the information that is being populated and managed in our school or whatever it's called? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2578.931s">on</a> the athletic side. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2579.992s">So</a> I didn't know what kind of integrations were available with final site that we should be thinking about taking advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2585.435s">And</a> those always are like sort of meaty projects that would definitely to your point of like internships and things like that, those sort of lend themselves to that kind of thinking a little bit more.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2768.137s">Got</a> it so and maybe the the right sort of implementation approach is to start with the some of the clubs and activities that don't really have a presence right now and work out sort of how that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2783.936s">can</a> work, whether it's like student students to have access to post on behalf of their clubs or that's something the advisors do, but I would imagine like as you do that there's some like rules of the road that come out right in terms of how to make it as effective as possible and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2801.815s">Maybe</a> like the next phase could ultimately be like when this integration is available from an athletics perspective we sort of bring the rest of the athletics teams along that same pathway that we've worked out with, with the extracurriculars, and I will say that final site.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3013.799s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think the the goal of this meeting was for us to have some discussion about the options for phase two so that we could, you know, bring that update back to the school committee for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3027.061s">But</a> also, you know, understand whatever we sort of think through and give Miss Miller in the in the project team some time to think about like what it will take and to do various things and what they might need from us to be able to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3042.718s">So</a> I think there's some work on their part and then we can reconvene so <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3047.431s">What</a> we might do at the end of this meeting is continue the meeting to a date in the future and then we'll sort of pick it up at a point, probably, you know, maybe even after the new year I'm not sure, depending on, you know, some information that, you know, depending on how much work there is to do to really think through those next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3072.073s">But</a> two other things that sort of were on my mind as I thought about the website in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3079.535s">One</a> was around payments, payments of all kind, and whether there's really like a sort of a, I'll say a single unified <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3095.635s">venue</a> for payments to Medford Public Schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3099.399s">And</a> I think the answer is no, or maybe not yet, but is there like a single place where you could go and you could pay for a lost library book, to add money to somebody's school lunch account, to sign up for athletics, to pay <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3120.639s">For</a> whatever the things are right that that money flows into our our school district from families and so you know maybe in the bigger picture I would want there not to have to be money that flows into the district from families, but in the meantime. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3138.931s">Is</a> there a single place and does final site have capabilities there that we should be exploring as part of phase two in terms of of all things payments and? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3150.856s">Certainly</a> when we talk about payments, security becomes a really big part of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3156.257s">And</a> I, you know, I will admit that I have some agita around our payment processes sort of across the district because I just don't know enough to feel like each and every one of them independently is, you know, sort of rising to the level of the kind of standards that you want to see in place when you start taking <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3180.345s">money.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3181.606s">So</a> I didn't know what kind of capabilities final site had, what we're using, what we're not using, what the options are, and how do we create like a single place for people to go when they have to do something like that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3364.798s">Yeah,</a> I think that could sort of get us a good portion of the way there, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3371.6s">So</a> I don't necessarily think it needs to be like, when I'm thinking about one-stop shopping, I think the thing that I'm thinking about the most is like the security required to safely sort of take online payments that we don't wanna be managing like many modules of, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3393.77s">um,</a> software that's taking in payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3395.851s">So</a> for, if everything is able to sort of coalesce around blue snap, then we know, and your team can make sure that like, we properly like worked with somebody who's a security expert around payments that we feel like. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3409.379s">Good</a> that they have all of the controls in place from a blue snap perspective, and then everything is flowing through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3414.702s">And</a> so that makes sort of life simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3417.864s">And</a> if there's a simple landing page for <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3419.81s">for</a> parents like coming in and saying, how do I pay this thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3423.473s">It</a> could be just as simple as like those two pieces sort of linking together. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3429.559s">And</a> I think that would be like a great next step in terms of like providing some accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3439.147s">And</a> I don't know if there are other things that are like operating outside of BlueSnap, but certainly like trying to like pull them all <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3447.273s">into</a> one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3449.035s">Certainly</a> you can pull them all into one place pretty easily, but also like on that back end from a like cash management perspective and our CFO would probably, you know, need to weigh in here, but how do we create like financial controls over the money that flows through whatever these tools are as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3467.73s">So</a> that would be like, that's one of the things on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3470.233s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3470.433s">Perry,</a> did you have your hand in the air?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3578.509s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3579.676s">Well,</a> and I think you know this could be sort of a great meaty little project for. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3587.718s">For</a> students to sort of sink their teeth into because it's it's a little bit it's bigger than just the web development piece of it, but it's really about how you make. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3596.641s">websites</a> useful, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3598.023s">So</a> you would make so many people happy if they could pay for their pool registration online. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3607.753s">But</a> to your point, if we have to have a way to have these checks and balances, what can be done to create something <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3618.775s">sort</a> of manageable and approachable that allows that to happen too, I think is, you know, a really great question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3663.006s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3804.616s">So</a> I just want to be mindful of the fact that we are sort of under the requirement of the open meeting law, and we really shouldn't be talking about things that aren't officially posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3813.642s">So</a> I think this is a great conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3817.705s">But</a> if there's a question about the website, I think we should continue to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3822.628s">But</a> I think your question is a little bit different than about the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3826.39s">Am</a> I right, Member McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3873.362s">Yeah,</a> and I don't think you can assume that because it's a city resource that the schools have access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3879.95s">There's</a> some particular laws, regulations, rules, whatever, about sharing of resources and how those things actually come to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3890.583s">So</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3891.946s">checking</a> in on that first makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3894.568s">And</a> then if there are phone numbers that can be used to sort of access this, making those numbers available on the website makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3904.534s">But</a> I think that needs to be sort of vetted before we can make the ask that it goes on to the website.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3917.302s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3921.266s">And</a> then I think the other, so two other comments that I had sort of on my agenda, I was in, we were, parents were invited to something that the guidance office was doing, like Coffee with the Guidance Councilor or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3942.142s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3945.445s">In</a> the context of that invitation, there was another website listed that was like medmhsguidance.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3956.849s">Hold</a> on, let me get the exact website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3958.09s">Cause</a> I wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3958.71s">I</a> was like, I have to remember to bring this medfordhighguidance.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3963.492s">And</a> so I think my question would be is like another phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3968.872s">sunsetting</a> the independent guidance website, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3973.438s">I</a> don't know, I haven't been there, but I would imagine that we would want the good work being done in our guidance department to be front and center as part of our website.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4000.683s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4000.923s">Perfect,</a> because I saw that I was like, how, how do we keep finding websites that are sort of like out in the ether here, but it is hard to sort of unwind them. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4010.149s">So</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4018.911s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4023.613s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4025.033s">So</a> to the point of some of the discussion we've had so far, I think the other next step that would be really great is something that officially describes for the public what's <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4040.47s">what's</a> on the website, what it's all about, that the website is available in five languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4046.862s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4048.479s">people</a> would be so delighted to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4052.081s">And</a> I don't think we've done a great job of describing all this good work outside of school committee meetings, of course, but I also am acutely aware that school committee meetings are attended by a very, very, very tiny fraction of the population. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4068.21s">And</a> we have, you know, 4,000 odd students that come through our doors every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4077.442s">how</a> can we sort of push out a more formal communication about what's on the website, what's available, how to access it, that the app exists, like how they work together, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4087.349s">So</a> I think a lot of really good work has been done that we need to promote. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4095.676s">So</a> I think that's like another sort of maybe next step or phase two type of item. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4103.889s">And</a> then. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4105.13s">Sort</a> of the last thing on my mind is really around some of the information that gets posted and shared about our school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4115.054s">So</a> one of the things that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4119.215s">As</a> we set our as we passed our first school committee set of goals, I think maybe ever in the history of Medford was talk about a desire to translate our. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4133.058s">our</a> agendas into multiple languages so that they are more accessible to our families than a simple English posting would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4144.73s">And</a> I happened to notice, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, that the last handful of agendas did include links <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4151.539s">if</a> I'm remembering correctly, that were translated, but.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4180.959s">And</a> I that's great news, I was so excited to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4187.107s">I</a> did wonder, though, it looks like somebody is like essentially having to hand translate them much like they do with your. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4196.249s">your</a> weekly memos, and I'm not sure if that's true, but it looked so similar in structure to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4201.95s">And</a> I just wondered if there was a better way to make use of the website if we were to post our agendas a little bit differently than we do, so that they're not PDFs, because PDFs can't be translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4213.792s">But</a> if there was a different way for us to post school committee materials to the website, would that inherently sort of avail us of <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4223.254s">the</a> translation services that are available through final site and make the process of all of this translation a little bit easier.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4246.704s">Thomas,</a> you had your hand in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4247.885s">Did</a> you want to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4312.017s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4312.898s">And</a> so I think, you know, that I think would be a great other sort of next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4319.342s">I</a> know we gave you like 25 next steps in phase two, so you can you can sort of put all those in a hat and shake up the hat and figure out like what makes the most sense from a implementation perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4330.11s">And,</a> you know, Carolyn and Rachel and <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4335.094s">Tenzine</a> and the other folks that are on the team certainly probably have a lot to say about the work that's required and the work that they are going to undertake. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4348.651s">So</a> I would certainly want to defer to you all to think about all the things that we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4354.877s">I</a> think this like school committee, this idea about using the website as sort of a way to power some of the objectives the school committee has around accessibility and translation, if we can get that right with the agendas, could we get that right with the minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4370.967s">And</a> could we get that right with some of the other materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4374.049s">And</a> so I don't wanna like, I don't wanna boil the ocean necessarily like right out of the gate, because I think that is where <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4381.093s">good</a> projects sort of fall apart, but if we could start and try with the agendas and get a process that works, is there a next thing and a next thing and a next thing that could build there? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4396.384s">Thomas?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4613.476s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4613.956s">I</a> think that's actually a great point, Eunice. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4618.917s">Because</a> what we don't, we follow all of the rules that sort of keep us in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4631.091s">and</a> make us consistent with the open meeting law and the posting requirements of the city, which are we're actually still a physical posting city, which is a whole other topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4642.053s">But</a> when it comes to like making people aware of what's on the school committee agenda, that's a different matter entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4650.615s">And</a> I don't think we do a great job at that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4656.876s">And</a> so people like yourself, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4659.096s">You</a> know me if I if there's something on the agenda that people you know it happens sort of organically which isn't a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4666.002s">But</a> if there was a posting on our website that we could sort of point to link to on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4675.109s">Then</a> it becomes easier to sort of put that posting in a whole variety of places on our website, you know, in various local pages and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4683.993s">And</a> then it becomes easier to link to from like the superintendents Friday memo and and all the other places we're communicating from so that people have people have a better chance of accessing that information than they do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4698.059s">I</a> think the other thing you sort of highlighted, which is not necessarily like a website thing but it's certainly a communication thing is that there is some sort of service happening by the city clerk who is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4715.566s">in</a> all transparency, paid for a specific job that he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4721.713s">And</a> this is part of his job responsibilities, is to get the word out about the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4727.059s">He</a> sort of works on behalf of the council exclusively. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4731.464s">But</a> he has, over time, I believe, created a mail list of sorts of people who wanted <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4737.51s">get</a> those things in their email box. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4738.991s">And</a> it's not the everybody, but the people who say, hey, can you put me on your list? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4743.233s">And</a> then it goes out on a weekly basis.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4748.495s">Yeah,</a> we don't have something like that yet in Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4752.697s">But</a> I think that's another question probably for Tom to think about in terms of communication and like, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4762.003s">how</a> do you start to manage like essentially like sub interest subscriptions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4769.048s">Like</a> that's, I think that's what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4771.27s">You</a> know, it's different than like everybody getting the superintendent's weekly memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4775.413s">It's</a> like people who want that email in their email box, signing up and saying, please send this to me, you know, on whatever the interval is. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4784.64s">And</a> so I don't know final site has some sort of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4788.763s">connectivity</a> that would make that easier or promote that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4793.009s">But</a> I think that's some food for thought that might address some of the comments from Eunice. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4798.776s">And</a> Tom, I see your hands in the air.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4916.279s">Wow,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4917.039s">I</a> did not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4919.95s">I</a> have my, we have our own like mechanisms where we get those things, but I get asked somewhat frequently, like, how do I make sure I can get these things that I've never really had a great answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4929.653s">So</a> when we talk about like what the website can do and communicating about that, that would be a really helpful example for people who may want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4939.395s">And</a> then it might be a little bit easier for people to get to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4961.673s">Yeah,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4962.854s">I</a> did not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4966.401s">So</a> we only have a few minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4969.242s">I</a> feel like we talked about a lot of potential things that could be phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4974.163s">And</a> I didn't know if there were any other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4981.066s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4981.366s">Miller</a> and our student website team, whether you had questions for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4990.051s">that</a> we could answer for you while we're all here together. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=4992.553s">And</a> I think my other question would be whether there are other sort of priorities that our students have that need to be sort of discussed and prioritized as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5005.541s">And</a> if you had questions for us about those.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5058.43s">Um,</a> no, Rachel, that's a great question and a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5062.474s">And</a> I definitely, I don't have an answer for you now, but I do have maybe some other questions for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5069.28s">Um,</a> and for miss Miller, like we, I think we're not that versed in what it takes to sort of create. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5077.518s">an</a> internship type role that meets like the educational standards, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5083.463s">That</a> your shop needs to sort of adhere to, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5087.606s">Because</a> we would wanna make sure that if we're gonna go down this road, that there's actually all the requirements are met because I know that the, you know, in vocational education, there's all kinds of like rules and sort of rules of the road that have to be complied with. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5101.977s">So</a> I think my question for the superintendent and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5106.02s">Miller</a> is, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5108.627s">whether</a> there's something that you need from us to sort of pursue that, or if that's like a takeaway that you can take and consider how we might be able to sort of formalize this into an internship role. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5123.259s">And</a> I mean, I think the possibilities of like the kinds of things that we need are somewhat endless. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5130.284s">And</a> certainly, you know, year to year, there could be, you know, lots of good stuff going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5138.043s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5138.223s">Miller?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5143.956s">Okay,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5145.157s">Miller,</a> did you wanna go first?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5307.924s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5308.425s">So,</a> and member McLaughlin, I think you had your hand in the air as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5357.98s">Yeah,</a> I think that's actually a great suggestion in terms of like thinking about how this becomes potentially a more formalized thing that could continue one year to the next is to like actually just, you know, sort of make a proposal in a business case. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5374.531s">for</a> the district to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5376.532s">And</a> I think to the extent that superintendent you need or want members of the school committee at the table in this discussion, we certainly can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5388.675s">But</a> I would assume that by and large, like this takeaway is for you all to sort of think about and report back to us on, is that fair? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5397.237s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5401.092s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5404.154s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5406.255s">Is</a> that a motion to continue?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5424.864s">Is</a> that a second Kathy?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5429.325s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5432.326s">Okay,</a> so we have a motion to continue to the first meeting of the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5435.787s">And</a> a second by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5438.847s">So</a> I'll call the roll because we're on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5440.988s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5442.268s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5443.428s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5445.029s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5446.115s">And</a> member Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5447.998s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5450.481s">This</a> topic is continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=5452.323s">And</a> so we- Thank you everyone.<h2><a href="../2023-10-04_X-UlsLTIb5Q/2023-10-04_X-UlsLTIb5Q.html">MSC Rules & Policy Subcommittee - 10.03.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=241.219s">Yeah,</a> I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=242.14s">What</a> was the date of that meeting again?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=257.964s">Okay,</a> a family member was literally asking me about recess this morning, who does not live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=265.069s">And</a> I was like, I know we've talked about this like several times, but I'm actually going to point her to that meeting and she may find it helpful, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=447.111s">But</a> I did have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=448.112s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=450.414s">Is</a> there a reason why all of these disparate things have to be bubbled into a wellness policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=461.524s">Because</a> if I was trying to find out what does the district think about <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=468.342s">recess</a> versus food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=470.963s">Like</a> I would never in a million years think to go to the same policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=475.225s">So</a> one question I have is like, is there some like regulatory reason why the wellness policy has to be written like this versus in maybe components?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=642.424s">Sorry,</a> before you do that, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, Dr. Cushing, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=649.426s">Bowen,</a> do you all have any reason, is there anything we're not thinking about that would require a wellness policy to be comprised of X or Y or Z?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=701.385s">I'm</a> more asking what we're required to do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=958.286s">Oh,</a> OK, good.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1026.584s">Sorry,</a> just one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1028.966s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1030.327s">So</a> is your motion essentially meaning that we are going to ultimately rescind not just ADF, but ADFR, ADFE1, and ADFE2?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1057.813s">No,</a> I wasn't, I was just reading the policy manual, trying to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1061.134s">Okay,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1062.614s">Yes,</a> that's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1065.074s">Okay,</a> so yes, let's vote on this piece.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1203.426s">So</a> motion to rescind ADFE1.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1447.498s">I</a> am looking at Linfield's policy and it does also cover a wellness committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1552.242s">not</a> want to designate a school committee, like a person, like as a wellness program coordinator in a policy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1566.714s">Like</a> about halfway through the paragraph, the school committee designates the following individuals as the wellness program coordinators. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1573.76s">Like</a> practically speaking, not want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1578.224s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1582.122s">The</a> Linfield policy that I'm looking at that I kind of like says that the superintendent along with the principal of each school shall be responsible for the implementation of this wellness policy and of addressing standards of health, wellness, nutrition, and physical activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1601.02s">And</a> that the committee like <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1604.676s">meets</a> quarterly and reports the school committee annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1607.157s">And</a> it also says like in terms of mission, the oversight of the wellness policy and regulations and is the means of assessing and promoting a healthy environment for Linfield Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1618.421s">I</a> like that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1620.642s">So</a> I sort of like their language. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1626.252s">mostly</a> better except like, I do like sort of how this one calls out like who the wellness committee is a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1637.478s">So</a> I feel like the first half of this might like make some sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1644.622s">And</a> I guess the question maybe for Howard is, is wellness coordinator a like defined role that we are supposed to have?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1687.694s">going</a> to copy this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1690.876s">Actually,</a> can you give me access to this document?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1696.439s">And</a> I can just drop the language right in?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1787.308s">And</a> I, I feel like meeting, I don't know, superintendent, if you disagree, but I feel like meeting quarterly is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1795.75s">If</a> the purview of this committee is as narrow as policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1840.635s">I</a> guess like the other question I had, just structurally, like could we like sort of describe this like main policy as sort of everything that's supposed to be in this policy from a model perspective, except food service, except allergies and except recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1863.831s">And</a> that those three things are like sort of topics unto themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1868.475s">So</a> they could be sub policies.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1954.837s">Can</a> I just ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1955.917s">I</a> just wanna clarify something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1960.522s">Maybe</a> Dr. Edward-Vincent or Shanine can answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=1963.143s">Is</a> the plan for that subgroup to bring their suggested policy to this group so that it can be officially adopted by the school committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2128.639s">Yeah,</a> I think we should delete it completely.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2132.34s">Sorry,</a> I thought I did, and it didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2133.64s">Maybe</a> go through.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2155.864s">I</a> feel like that should go in the food service sub-policy, so it doesn't belong here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2268.693s">Anyway,</a> yeah, I mean because because it's curriculum we we don't have authority over it anyway.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2323.254s">I</a> am going to drop in what Linfield <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2329.716s">has</a> in their policy, I think it's like really brief and sufficient.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2389.201s">So</a> if we just look at what I forwarded over, Medford strives to provide nutrition education at all grade levels by integrating it into other subjects and having it as part of health education. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2400.689s">Students</a> will gain the knowledge and skills to select a diet that supports health and reduces the risk of illness and future chronic diseases in accordance with state standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2409.395s">Like,</a> do we need to say anything more than that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2469.865s">So</a> they do commingle recess a fair bit into this policy, into this piece, which I don't think we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2478.329s">But</a> they do describe physical activity and physical education <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2492.554s">as</a> well, hold on one second, as well as health education. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2497.676s">So</a> that's like a whole separate topic, but they talk about physical activity and physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2503.198s">And</a> I just think maybe we might like to use this more as like a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2513.862s">So</a> let me, I'm gonna drop it right after nutrition.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2549.932s">So</a> physical activity, it basically says, we shall provide a physical and social environment that encourages safe and enjoyable activities for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2559.699s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2560.72s">Classroom</a> teachers shall be encouraged in supporting their efforts to incorporate movement as part of classroom activities to provide short physical activity breaks between lessons and classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2573.052s">This</a> one is sort of like starts to get a little bit murky because it starts to talk about recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2578.876s">So</a> maybe for clarity, we just say we prohibit the use of withholding of physical activity as a punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2586.441s">And</a> like, we deal with like the recess aspects of this in the recess policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2592.445s">And</a> then I would take out four and five completely <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2600.219s">because</a> they're about recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2601.681s">So</a> that can be dealt with in the recess policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2603.624s">And</a> then if you keep going, six, all students grade K to 12 will participate in sequential developmentally appropriate physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2615.118s">Consistent</a> with Massachusetts curriculum frameworks, the physical education program will promote the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to foster lifelong enjoyment and participation of physical activity for wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2626.548s">MPS</a> will encourage relationships between families and community members to institute programs that support physical activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2631.973s">I</a> don't exactly think I know what that means, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2636.778s">It</a> doesn't like strike me significantly one way or the other.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2647.485s">Fair.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2648.866s">Encourage</a> family and community members to institute programs that support physical activities such as promoting safe routes to school program for those students that live within a walkable, bikeable distance to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2660.613s">I</a> actually think that is useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2666.002s">Afterschool</a> programs will be encouraged to provide options that provide developmentally appropriate physical activity for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2670.723s">I</a> think that's reasonable and consistent with what we try to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2677.204s">MPS</a> will encourage the offering of opportunities for students to participate in physical activity before and after the school day through a variety of methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2686.306s">I</a> feel like that sounds great, but it doesn't need to be in policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=2984.618s">Mr.</a> Tucci has his hand in the air to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3058.666s">So</a> I feel like we're like, you know, diving fast into the recess policy here, but I wonder if like for the purposes of like this physical activity section, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3069.417s">Could</a> we remove this bullet completely in its entirety? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3074.447s">Because</a> we have to get there as it relates to recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3079.113s">in</a> the recess policy, which is to me the more appropriate place for us to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3084.074s">But</a> I will also say I've heard lots of stories about logical consequences being used to like completely inappropriately and not necessarily here in Medford, but just as a general statement as like there's complete justification for taking recess away because I told them that that's what was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3106.261s">you</a> know, do whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3108.043s">So</a> I think we have to talk about that and like, you know, all the things, all the other things you guys are talking about, but I don't think like we have to get spun up in this part of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3124.956s">Really,</a> that's just my take.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3456.571s">I</a> just added the word extracurricular to number six, because when I read afterschool, I've sort of been drilled into my brain that we mean the K to five afterschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3468.259s">Lots</a> of other things happen after school too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3470.4s">So</a> I just added an extracurricular activities, number six. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3473.302s">And</a> then I basically put a number seven that references like applicable MIA guidelines.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3490.507s">I</a> think they're subject to MIAA guidelines, right, Dr. Cushing?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3565.243s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3565.604s">I</a> mean, well, PTO stuff is like a super sticky wicket because we have no authority
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3606.787s">So</a> I guess my take is that the MIAA guidelines, Dr. Cushing, correct me if I'm wrong, would lay out guidelines that are consistent with federal regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3629.161s">Is</a> that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3650.02s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3651.041s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3651.361s">Can</a> we just maybe put a comment for six and seven?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3748.829s">And</a> Shanine, I think your points are well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3755.292s">And</a> I think we just probably all need a minute to figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3759.989s">what</a> policy issues we need to solve and reflect here versus what you are describing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3768.871s">I'm</a> not as familiar with the instances that you're talking about, but that's just because I'm not as familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3773.951s">So</a> I don't feel like I know how to fix the policy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3784.773s">But</a> yeah, I agree.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3909.939s">This</a> is from Winfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=3911.28s">So</a> I think my question is what is the right description of our timeframes and do they need to be reflected in policy at all?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4106.585s">So</a> what I just did in the language was remove the number of minutes from policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4114.37s">And</a> in that first bullet, as you were describing, talk about like, that we will obviously comply at minimum with the state approved frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4124.277s">But</a> I also added a line which I'm totally open to discussion about that, if for some reason the district is gonna materially change the amount of minutes of physical education, that that would, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4136.765s">be</a> something that would come to the school committee for approval, because if we're gonna reduce the amount of physical activity going on, I feel like that is worthy of a discussion, even though we're not laying out some hard amount of time that we're binding the district to in the policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4249.694s">So</a> I just suggested a change that says like the material reductions in total minutes per year of physical education is what would require school committee approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4260.757s">So</a> if we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4263.413s">you</a> know, that would sort of give us some like leeway on the scheduling piece, but not, but still like require that if somebody was like, we're going to cut phys ed in half, that that conversation can be had with the school committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4289.816s">I</a> did have a question about this number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4293.299s">Again,</a> this is from Linfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4296.321s">Waivers,</a> exemptions and substitutions for physical education will not be granted except to meet a student's medical or social emotional needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4309.873s">I</a> guess what I would rather talk about is like, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4316.343s">the</a> process for waivers, exemptions and substitutions so that they are consistently applied versus like this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4347.777s">Well,</a> that would be a medical need, I suppose.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4398.024s">Well,</a> this is just, Ed, this is just physical education section.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4413.713s">Remember,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4511.685s">So</a> maybe that's what this is getting after, but it doesn't really say that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4547.471s">Or</a> even substitutions, like, I don't even know what that would entail for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4555.696s">Like,</a> does that mean I... It could mean PT, like if people are doing physical therapy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4734.708s">So,</a> you know, wait, before we do that, I actually think they should be separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4742.114s">And</a> I think that because there's a difference between a waiver, an exemption, or a substitution, whatever those things are, that is like specifically requested by a student or caregiver, and that there should be a process to vet those, whether it's like in accordance with an IEP or 504, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4767.748s">that's</a> fine, but there probably are other reasons, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4772.492s">Like,</a> you know, student gets an accident, needs to not have gym class for six months, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4777.777s">So</a> I think what I'd like to see number three become is about that students and caregivers may request this and that those decisions will be made in accordance with <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4791.363s">the</a> 504s, IEPs or specific circumstances and who will, how do you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4799.325s">Like,</a> that's what I would like to see number three become is like, if I need a waiver for my kid, how do I do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4808.848s">Like,</a> how does it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4812.069s">And</a> that that's the policy, that there is a process <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4816.573s">in</a> order for people that we have, we have a process in order for people to request a waiver, should they need it, to me is what three should become, which is to me also different than the inverse of that, which is the district saying, we don't have time to teach your kid physical education, which is a different problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4839.924s">So</a> I feel like there's like, am I the caregiver requesting that or is the, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4847.057s">is</a> the school district telling me that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4850.099s">And</a> I think those are two different sort of needles to thread.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4945.564s">But</a> would staff be in the next bullet? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4947.484s">What</a> I'm trying to do is distinguish like who is doing the asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4951.865s">Like</a> if staff is doing the asking, then the district is doing the asking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=4964.948s">Yeah,</a> hold on one second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5018.085s">So</a> in accordance with approved IEPs and 504s, that's one like category. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5022.886s">504,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5024.627s">That's</a> one category. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5026.147s">Or</a> at the discretion of the director of physical, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5031.408s">Or</a> at the discretion of the director of physical education, which in my mind would include like the medical note situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5040.558s">like</a> that still has to go to somebody, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5043.299s">It</a> still has to be approved by somebody.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5441.33s">I</a> just updated number one, it says all students are entitled to physical education in grades K to 12, unless otherwise defined and approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5450.123s">And</a> in an approved IEP or 504, the amount of time will comply at minimum with state approved frameworks, material reductions in the total minutes per year to physical education shall be approved by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5462.229s">And</a> then we could get rid of three and four.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5638.342s">So</a> what about otherwise provided by law or regulation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5743.969s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5744.229s">There</a> are state frameworks around that, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5835.515s">graduation</a> requirements are also the purview of the school committee right and there are documented graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5844.165s">Somewhere</a> we've never taken them up that that we've been around Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5849.424s">But</a> there probably are graduation requirements that like you're referring to, but they just also may not have anything to do with the law, but being something that we have purview over.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5894.52s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5894.9s">And</a> I think as written, all we're saying is that we will comply with state frameworks, which if there are no state frameworks, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5904.285s">We're</a> still in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5906.427s">But</a> I agree that we should ask Rachel to weigh in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5911.269s">Like</a> this is the problem with this wellness policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5913.15s">It's</a> like all over the place in terms of the topics that it covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5916.973s">So</a> it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5917.833s">There's</a> no, there's no, we're already over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5919.754s">There's</a> no chance for finishing this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5921.915s">And</a> we didn't even get to recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5923.296s">So,</a> but having said that, a separate conversation around graduation requirements, like may be in order at some point in time in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5934.022s">But</a> this to me, like I read this as like, this is the overarching framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=5938.664s">of</a> K-12 for Medford Public Schools, which is obviously they can't, it can't conflict with graduation requirements, but it is much broader than what you must do to graduate high school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6017.133s">This,</a> that was just, that was the model policy from MASC.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6022.017s">That</a> we rewrote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6023.799s">We</a> liked the Linfield one better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6026.821s">I</a> think the other, like, just note, if I'm reading through this Linfield policy, there are some other components of the Linfield policy that we may want to talk about in the next meeting, in addition to recess, so that we can take one swipe at this policy and actually get it in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6043.334s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6043.735s">But</a> we can talk about that next time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6121.817s">So</a> I just closed it and I promise not to look at it again.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6137.168s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/X-UlsLTIb5Q&t=6138.77s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2023-10-03_YeIUKo9SmWU/2023-10-03_YeIUKo9SmWU.html">10.2.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3853.689s">Other</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3856.711s">I</a> just had a couple of questions from the chair, if I might. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3859.232s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3860.073s">Can</a> we be sure to record this session on November 14th so that it can be posted? <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3866.196s">And</a> I think it will enable translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3868.558s">So</a> if we have a recording, it can be subtitled and translated into other languages quite simply if we have the initial recording.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3882.826s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3883.933s">I</a> was just curious when you reviewed this with principles, what was the feedback from them and what were the questions that they had? <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3895.742s">And</a> what was the overall feeling about the work that we did?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3979.363s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3979.924s">And</a> the other question that I had was around the use of a Google Form instead of like school brains for the tracking of all <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=3988.567s">this</a> information, I would assume that you've previously tracked somewhere other than a Google form, but I don't know, I'm just curious.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4028.596s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4029.316s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4029.977s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4033.178s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4034.078s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4038.515s">Item</a> number six, we have a report on Medford High School Culture and Climate Survey from school year 2022 to 2023, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4370.051s">Sorry,</a> member Rousseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4694.88s">If</a> I may, I don't think that answers are what is being called to question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4702.662s">It's</a> the interpretation of what the answers mean, and they are inconsistent across this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4708.764s">So</a> I would not want this report to be broadly published where somebody could take it and say, oh, 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4720.106s">think</a> that only 30% of people don't think that kids are bullied and picked on when really 70% of people don't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4731.38s">So</a> some of it is about the design of the questions is problematic because some of them are positive and some of them are negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4738.349s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=4739.215s">whether</a> you agree or you disagree, the right answer, like the yes, things are good answer is different from question to question to question, which is not great like survey hygiene, because it makes it really hard for people to take the survey.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5336.381s">very</a> happy to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5337.442s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5338.222s">Um</a> sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5339.182s">Everybody</a> who was watching the internet here in Council Chambers went down and disconnected us from Zoom although it looks like you all were able to mostly stick with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5350.524s">Um</a> before we recessed, we were having a discussion about the report on school climate that the superintendent was providing and I <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5363.976s">Internet,</a> I did ask the superintendent if her preference would be to finish delivering this report or if she wanted to table it to sort of just do the double check of the data to make sure it is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5376.76s">And</a> I think, you know, we don't need or want to do it twice, but I will defer to you in terms of whether you want to proceed or if you would like to table.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5788.234s">Okay,</a> before we make an official motion to table I did see a hand on zoom, Jessica. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5794.079s">And</a> Jessica just to be clear, we will talk about this in its totality at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5802.486s">But</a> if you had something you wanted to say tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5805.128s">I</a> wanted to welcome you to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/YeIUKo9SmWU&t=5808.651s">And</a> provide your name and address for the record.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4021.319s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4022.42s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4022.82s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4025.202s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4026.124s">The</a> question I had was more around what happens when students go to class and then leave to use the restroom or mill around or whatever, whatever might be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4039.507s">And</a> like, what's the difference between I'm here and I just went to the bathroom and I'm absent from class. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4046.508s">Is</a> there like, and is there like, how are you sort of driving at consistency so that all the teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4053.993s">are</a> taking the same approach to that question, particularly about what happens in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4060.695s">And</a> then I think the other thing that we had concerns about last year was we heard like pretty clearly from teachers, like I don't even bother doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4071.857s">I</a> don't even bother like reporting kids who are absent to class or who spend a lot of time out of class because nothing happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4080.18s">And</a> so I think the other question I have is <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4082.25s">how</a> do you know it's actually happening, like with any sort of fidelity in the classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4087.374s">Because</a> otherwise you can't, you don't have good data if it's not being reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=4090.577s">So</a> I think those are both questions that are less about like, did you come to school and more about like what happened while you were in school that I would love to hear a little more about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5423.519s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5424.84s">I</a> was at <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5425.799s">HAB-Charlotte</a> Pitts, she-her, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she- <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5446.122s">how</a> we integrate the vocational and the high school schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5451.643s">And</a> my hope is that when we talk about like having only three minutes to pass, like I don't have any issue with there being no backpacks allowed to be like running around the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5460.925s">I'm</a> totally fine with that, but then it has to be viable that kids can move around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5467.706s">Like</a> my daughter can't even get to class on time and she's not going to her locker because three minutes isn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5473.749s">feasibly</a> enough for her to go from point A to point B. And I know that the other thing we're going to bump into, like we can't just arbitrarily give them more time to pass because we are dangerously short, maybe too short on instructional minutes to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5490.202s">I'm</a> hoping that the scheduling consultant that you all are working with is going to look at the schedule for all of the problems that it provides us and presents us with. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5500.864s">And</a> you should be able to go to your locker at some reasonable interval. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5504.965s">I</a> also think you should never need to carry a three ring binder because I'd never want to hold one of those in my hands as long as I live, because they're huge and it's 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5512.727s">But</a> I think there is some challenge around <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5520.475s">the</a> practices that we're enforcing that drive the need for a backpack. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5526.697s">And</a> then the reality of the schedule just not being sufficient, even in the perfect case scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5532.859s">So</a> I think there's a lot of things to like unravel. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5535.48s">And</a> so I don't think it's like, I think backpacks are the thing that are sort of flaring. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5539.602s">But</a> for me, I don't think backpacks are necessarily the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5544.864s">Like</a> I think we have maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5546.417s">a</a> bunch of problems and backpacks sort of get lumped as like the thing that is happening that's really problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5552.998s">But</a> I am glad that people are thinking about what all the problems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5557.939s">And</a> I appreciate that you're taking the feedback and you're listening to people and really and challenging everybody to really rethink the things that they say, because I heard that loud and clear like from you in multiple different settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5574.083s">And</a> I'm super appreciative of that because <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5576.567s">You</a> didn't create any of these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5578.308s">These</a> problems all like were on your desk on the day you walked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5582.13s">And</a> that's a real travesty for all of us that we allowed this to happen for as many years as we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5590.273s">Thank</a> you for actually solving problems and doing so in a way that restores some order to the building, because I think that's super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5600.49s">But</a> hopefully when we talk about scheduling, we can be talking about all the things that are scheduling related, so we can move on from backpacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5609.739s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5610.48s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=5611.701s">Dr.</a> Edward-Vinson.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6006.168s">Remember</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6009.289s">Can</a> I just ask one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6011.31s">One</a> of the things that we talked about when we pass this resolution was trying to get a feel from you all about the kind of data that you're going to be using to make sure that everything is working the way you're intending and you talked about that already tonight but I think the other variable that we talked about was. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6027.867s">when</a> does it make sense for you to come and give us an update again? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=6031.368s">And</a> I don't want us to prescribe that necessarily, but more curious from your perspective about like, when even is there enough data for us to talk about a second time?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8448.463s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8452.427s">I</a> might offer a friendly amendment to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8457.472s">I</a> think what <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8459.278s">we</a> need to do together is agree on the approach that we will take to create the next strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8467.347s">Because</a> if I'm being perfectly honest, if you read our strategic plan, every last thing you could think of <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8475.032s">could</a> be like yep there it is yep there it is yep there it is so literally anything anybody wants to do like today if you read our strategic plan you'd be like yeah that's in here and it shouldn't be that's not to me that's not what a viable strategic plan looks like um because a strategic plan can't be all things to all people all at once to your point like it has to be focused and i think <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8500.02s">It's</a> very broad right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8501.902s">And</a> that's was the first one we ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8505.147s">So</a> that's, you know, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8507.369s">But</a> I think as we go forward, what we need to, I think what we all need to agree on is the approach we will take to strategic planning and what it will look like when it's done and who will do what. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8516.441s">So,</a> for example, like <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8518.447s">Our</a> mission is like a mouthful it doesn't resonate with me at all it never has but like. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8524.373s">I</a> don't really want the superintendent to just like go off in a closet and create like a new one on her own right because that's not the way to get an entire system of hundreds of people moving in the same direction, there has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8538.379s">some</a> collaboration and it's now the right time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8541.142s">Maybe</a> it is maybe it isn't, but I think those are the kinds of things that we could talk about when we talk about how will we create this next strategic plan and where, where will the school committee be involved and how, how will we engage the community like <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8555.063s">This</a> is a chance for us to really think about like what that next strategic plan looks like so that we all know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8562.772s">And</a> so I don't think necessarily like us sitting around and trying to like dive deeper into like 85 pages really gets us there but instead to say like, what about the process of a broader strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8577.625s">do</a> we need to agree on in terms of its premise and how long it's going to take and how we will engage various people. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8583.388s">Like</a> to me, that would actually be maybe more actionable than us sitting around and saying, like, we want to talk more about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8594.394s">And</a> somebody says, yes, we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8595.835s">And</a> then somebody says, yes, we'll do the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8597.395s">Like,</a> I think it has to, like a strategic plan can't come together in a meeting like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8601.818s">It</a> has to come together over a period of time and with a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8606.764s">I</a> wonder if what we really should do is have a committee of the whole that addresses how we will create this next district strategic plan with this as obviously an important input. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=8617.433s">So,</a> and that was like a big mouthful and not exactly like an amendment, but that was what I was thinking about as we're talking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9223.742s">What</a> would the motion be that we <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9228.106s">conduct</a> a committee of the whole to share our collective thoughts about the common themes across these various reports as input to the process that we will embark on to update the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9245.959s">That</a> sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9248.921s">Did</a> you get all of that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9295.118s">Sounds</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9297.5s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor from Member Hays, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9302.143s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9304.584s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9306.005s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9312.137s">Okay,</a> we have, are there any other questions for the group here? <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9321.8s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9322.66s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9324.921s">We</a> have no presentations of the public scheduled for this evening and no continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9332.403s">We</a> do have some new business resolution 2023-20 offered by member Rousseau, a resolution in support of the Rural Schools Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/B_or_Ix1ooU&t=9341.417s">Whereas</a> rural districts.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=183.346s">Member</a> Graham, we will have to take a vote at some point to identify who our delegate is to the Delegate Assembly and a backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=191.47s">And</a> I am planning to attend as well, but I was not planning to try to be a delegate, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=200.293s">So</a> I think we just need to figure out who all is interested in going, and then we can figure out how we make sure we have a delegate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=1895.453s">So</a> I'm Allison it's nice to see me, meet some of you again I've met some of you already. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=1901.738s">It's</a> been an amazing two weeks, three weeks, I am happy to come to work every day I love the kids the smiles in the morning it's my favorite thing in the morning to go outside and say just good morning to all the kids and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=1913.168s">Hopefully</a> that sets their tone for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=1917.271s">And</a> I have been welcomed so warmly and I already feel part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=1922.294s">So</a> thank you all very much.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4185.341s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4186.981s">I'll</a> circle back to HVAC in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4191.095s">the</a> conversation about the Brooks field. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4194.376s">I</a> just want to reiterate for those of us who are newer to the conversation that when that field was installed, it was after years and years and years of failure of what was supposed to be a place, a green place for kids to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4209.883s">And</a> it was actually a brown place for kids to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4214.045s">And</a> the PTO made a significant investment in that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4216.566s">They</a> did not pay for nearly <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4219.045s">anything</a> that led up to the actual like total cost, but they did, they were asked to contribute $15,000 out of their raised funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4228.852s">And</a> in doing that, we were promised that that field would be maintained on the same contract that the field of the high school is maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4238.779s">And</a> it seems like maybe we're on a better path to that now, but that predated me being on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4246.044s">So</a> I've been here for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4248.086s">for</a> more than four years, that field has not been maintained, which means that we are doing it to ourselves again, where we're not maintaining things that are going to be expensive and cause problems like that field five, six years ago, however many years ago it was, it was like $100,000 then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4266.77s">So</a> we can't keep doing this to ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4270.71s">It's</a> not wise financially, it's not good for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4274.97s">Um</a> the other thing I will say about that project is we were also promised there was a phase two of that project which was to address um the runoff that comes down the hill so that um our own runoff down the hill did not does not um further deteriorate the field with all the as rainwater washes things off to my knowledge that has never been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4295.94s">So,</a> my understanding and I could be completely wrong was that we were just waiting in a queue somewhere with the DPW and they <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4304.389s">I</a> don't even know if it's on the DPWs list and it's just the list is seven years long and we haven't gotten there, but that hasn't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4311.57s">It's</a> gonna continue to run and wash dirt and everything else down the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4316.631s">So</a> it's gonna continue to be a problem, but we have to start doing something differently because this lack of maintenance is just, it's wildly expensive to not maintain big critical pieces of infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4334.955s">And</a> we just like, we can't, we can't keep doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4338.178s">Like</a> I almost fell out of my chair when I saw that there were 29 failed compressors and more equipment than that, even that is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4346.506s">Like</a> that didn't all break last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4348.608s">Like</a> this stuff has been broken like since forever, I'm assuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4352.652s">And</a> I don't even know, but I think we have to do a better job of understanding what our maintenance issues is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4360.769s">are</a> like this committee has been asking this question in a lot of earnest for the entirety of the time I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4367.171s">Like</a> we've been talking about what's the capital plan, what are the capital needs, like none of that work has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4373.494s">So</a> I'm not, sadly not that surprised that we have 29 failed compressors because we've never had an inventory of like what is the equipment that needs to be maintained and is it being maintained? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyaJr-WuDtk&t=4385.718s">So</a> we have to<h2><a href="../2023-08-15_-UAt_iIJnXg/2023-08-15_-UAt_iIJnXg.html">MSC - Special Meeting - 08.14.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=330.568s">I</a> had a chance to meet Jerry last week, the week before, two weeks ago, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=338.536s">And</a> I really appreciated the conversation we were able to have about the planning that's ahead of us as we think about rolling off of ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=349.026s">And</a> definitely appreciated his <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=352.429s">starting</a> point, which was enrollment projection, which is not something we've really ever talked about as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=358.311s">And</a> I think it's really important for us to start having that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-UAt_iIJnXg&t=361.732s">So</a> I'm excited to welcome Jerry to the team, and I would make a motion to approve.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1511.834s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1513.555s">Superintendent,</a> can you go back to member Hays' question? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1517.996s">I</a> just wanted to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1522.078s">So</a> I think what is being perceived as a discrepancy here is, in my mind, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1528.32s">So</a> we're talking, there's two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1530.401s">There's</a> a definition of bullying, which is what you have highlighted here. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1534.815s">When</a> you scroll down to that next section, the intent of that was to describe what the findings could look like and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1543.0s">And</a> this power differential is absolutely part of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1548.923s">But</a> what we were trying to do, and the reason it's sub-bulleted, is to say an investigation could conclude in any number of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1557.428s">And</a> we did that because I think what we found in the feedback that we got was that lots of things come back as like, this is not bullying, it's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1568.191s">And</a> it's never been, it's never clear to families, like, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1572.712s">So</a> this is, in my mind, this is not in conflict with the definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1577.693s">It</a> is instead and rather an attempt as a sub bullet to number 49, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1584.693s">to</a> be a way to explain findings, not to redefine in any way, shape or form like what bullying is, but to qualify like how findings come to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1597.976s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1599.757s">We</a> had a ton of discussion about this in five subcommittee meetings and this idea of what findings look like and what <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1609.019s">parents</a> can reasonably expect was something we worked really hard on to try to qualify for people so that when they're reading this, we're starting to set expectations for folks that this is <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1622.967s">that</a> many things could happen as the result of a bullying investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1627.169s">And</a> this is just one, a finding of bullying is just one of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1632.17s">So</a> that was my response when it comes to member Hays' question. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1637.813s">And</a> then can you scroll down to member McLaughlin's next question? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1644.795s">Yeah,</a> on this bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1646.436s">Again,</a> this is a sub bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1648.317s">So</a> if you scroll up to the actual bullet, the bullet is part of what Medford Public Schools will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1655.861s">So</a> in the second bullet there, if you scroll down a little bit, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1661.83s">On</a> row 80, MedBurgh Public Schools will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying intervention to students and professional development to build the skills of the staff as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1672.473s">Staff</a> will receive annual training on the bullying prevention intervention plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1675.734s">Such</a> training may include, but not be limited to, and then there's a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1679.555s">If</a> I recall correctly, this list was part of the current policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1685.399s">All</a> that we did here was try to make it more clear what this list was because there were a lot of lists in the original policy and it was just sort of a mess to try to understand what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1695.586s">So</a> this is framed as <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1698.928s">Things</a> Medford public schools will do, we will provide age appropriate instruction and annual professional development that training may include but will not be limited to these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1709.92s">And</a> it's really at the discretion of the superintendent to decide what that annual training looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1716.628s">And</a> so one of those topics could be information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1722.794s">It's</a> not unlike any other, so I am personally of the mind that we don't need to sort of complicate it with like a reference back to something because it's a sub-bullet that just describes the kinds of things that could happen in professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1739.403s">And</a> then could you scroll down to Member McLaughlin's other question, incident reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1745.79s">So</a> I guess what I was thinking about as you were talking, Member McLaughlin, is if that motion, and I think the answer is it's not quite there yet, but we made a motion about incident reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1759.409s">And</a> what we didn't do was codify it into policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1763.651s">But</a> I think incident reports can be about many, many things over and above what happens as it relates to this bullying report. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1772.314s">So</a> what I think would be most appropriate is for us to codify that incident report <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1780.353s">motion</a> that we made into a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1783.137s">And</a> then when we do that, we just come back and we make an update to this policy to add a reference that this bullying policy will substantially conform with that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1795.715s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1796.815s">When</a> you write policy, you don't want to put things in lots of places because it becomes really hard to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1801.698s">And</a> I think incident reporting in that context that we already passed is much, much bigger than it is specific to bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1809.302s">So</a> I would rather see us formalize that as a policy and then come back to this document and reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1816.185s">And</a> so that's just a suggestion on how we move forward on that question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=1844.451s">I</a> think somebody may need to unmute her.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3122.467s">To</a> insert a bullet that reads provide interpretation and translation services for families so that a comprehensive and productive collaboration can occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3134.548s">I'm</a> gonna just put it in the chat so that everyone can read it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3149.953s">And</a> so the reason that it goes here is because it's an overarching requirement of central administration to make sure that this is available to families as they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3159.556s">And</a> how you operationalize that is something that the central administration would be responsible for.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3287.577s">If</a> you can just give me like one second, I'm actually typing something about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3378.527s">Mayor,</a> do I still have the floor or have we moved on? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3380.768s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3693.942s">Mayor,</a> I have a comment before we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3697.704s">Okay,</a> comment before you vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3699.106s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3702.948s">I</a> think just trying to drop in a definition here totally sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3710.781s">diminishes</a> the entire intent of 49 all the way through to 64. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3716.046s">That</a> was written as a block intentionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3718.528s">And</a> so I am absolutely not in favor of doing this in this way because it does not take into account the relationship of the three things that could come out of a finding, which is conflict, bullying or not bullying or conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3734.563s">And</a> if you just, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3736.144s">change</a> this piece, the integrity of the whole section is not quite right and it's confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3744.891s">So</a> I am not in favor of this and I will vote no, I'll happily do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3749.294s">But</a> I'm asking my colleagues to really think about how to do this thing that they're asking us to do without compromising other really important components of this document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3832.916s">Can</a> I respond to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3833.717s">Because</a> we did talk about that in subcommittee quite a lot.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3843.422s">So</a> we we talked about this extensively with lots of principles on the phone and we really pressed them on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3850.826s">And</a> one of the things that they described <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3854.778s">Like</a> the same behavior could be bullying and it could be conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3861.3s">And</a> the differentiation of those two things is really about power. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3866.961s">And</a> so if you have two students who do not have a power differential and they are having a problem, that finding is gonna come back as conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3877.083s">So</a> the two students are having conflict <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3880.644s">and</a> there's a way forward and it is not like a sustained repetitive thing that that's exactly why so many things come back as conflict and not as bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3892.327s">And</a> so what the administrators described, and Dr. Cushing can keep me honest here if I am misremembering, but that they described that one of the reasons why parents are so upset when their finding comes back as conflict is because <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3909.403s">the</a> decision that's being made, and it's absolutely being made in all of these cases, is that these students, these two students in question, they legitimately are having a conflict, but the conflict is not exacerbated by this power differential. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3926.577s">And</a> instead, the finding is conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3928.658s">The</a> very same things can happen in the output of conflict versus bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3933.803s">The</a> very same things can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3936.044s">The</a> difference is, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3938.366s">it</a> rises to the level of bullying when certain criteria are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3943.65s">And</a> what we heard again and again and again from the administrators who do this every single day is that the actual thing that differentiates bullying from conflict is like, is this this idea of is there a power differential here? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3958.861s">Yes</a> or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3959.602s">And,</a> you know, frankly, administrators are like assessing power differentials like all day long, every single day in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3966.787s">that's</a> just sort of the nature of being an administrator in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3971.309s">And</a> so that was one of the things we talked a lot about. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3975.95s">And</a> prior, like the policy, it said something like, well, it could be bullying or it could be conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3981.692s">And</a> there was no qualification for like what that meant, why it meant, or like how parents could understand like <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3989.989s">What</a> does that mean for me and what happens next? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=3992.152s">And</a> so we really pushed the administrators on this like over the course of several meetings to help us define <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4001.567s">how</a> can we set people's expectations about this thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4004.588s">And</a> that is why you have this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4006.109s">So</a> if the motion is to replace this piece, you're degrading this, the intent and the spirit of this section, which is to like help people understand what is conflict and what is bullying and what is, or that both could not be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4025.175s">And</a> without, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4027.437s">a</a> thoughtful look at how this whole section works, like we're doing a disservice to the policy that we've worked really hard on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4870.29s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4870.81s">So</a> why don't you make those motions? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4873.172s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4876.434s">So</a> the first one is a motion to amend the proposed policy at line 371. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4879.536s">Sorry,</a> there's a bug flying around my face. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4884.399s">To</a> add the following bullet, the office of civil rights is available to help families see the additional information at the following link for additional detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4892.304s">And</a> then there is a link to a fact sheet from the office of civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4899.051s">and</a> I just popped it into the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=4902.116s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5002.063s">Okay,</a> here's the next one motion to amend line 56 as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5007.667s">A</a> finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5035.038s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5037.396s">It's</a> in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5038.457s">A</a> finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues unedited.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5057.669s">Yeah,</a> a finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5063.512s">Got</a> it, okay, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5065.771s">And</a> then the connection is, and may occur when the incident is determined and then everything else sort of stays as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5076.396s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5076.736s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5078.437s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5078.757s">Motion</a> on the floor, seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5080.458s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5329.303s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5331.623s">There's</a> a motion on the floor from Member McLaughlin, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5335.316s">Member</a> Hays, I have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5338.057s">Member</a> Rossell, go ahead.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5542.591s">So</a> member McLaughlin, that is my suggestion based on what I'm hearing is that we frame it that we're we're specifically qualifying that what we're talking about here are incident reports that recur as the result of bullying investigations, because otherwise they're going to be like housed outside of this completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5559.741s">And</a> that the parent caregivers need to receive these reports promptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5565.405s">And</a> so that <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5567.486s">provide</a> some flexibility to make sure that like the intent of as soon as you can is out there, but also allows the administrators to do what they need to do from a
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5613.674s">Yeah,</a> I think it's at least my suggestion that that belongs in the overarching policy about incident reports because <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5622.045s">you</a> could have incidents that ultimately become part of a bullying investigation, but they aren't that when they start. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5629.766s">So</a> I think that belongs more in that overarching policy than it does here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5721.533s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5722.653s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5724.194s">I</a> just made a suggestion in the chat that I think does both of the things that you're wanting to do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5730.596s">And</a> there are no motions on the floor with seconds at the moment, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5751.544s">Okay,</a> on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5753.205s">I</a> need a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5755.745s">Member</a> McLaughlin, is there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5757.686s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5758.726s">Seconded</a> by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5759.747s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5791.477s">So</a> five in the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5846.243s">So</a> we'll wait to see what her vote is and we can amend the tally as necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5854.008s">Are</a> there any other motions for amendment on the floor or to be made?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5899.186s">Could</a> we just add, are placed in the student file as required by law?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5908.112s">So</a> motion to amend row 190 to add as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5912.855s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5913.888s">by</a> member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5915.389s">Is</a> there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5916.19s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=5917.11s">By</a> member Hays.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6187.683s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6189.839s">Give</a> me one second to find my agenda, which is lost in a sea of tabs.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6279.367s">I</a> just, I had a suggestion on this before we maybe make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6289.875s">I</a> think I would like to request that our new communications director, Mr. Thomas Dalton, who appears to be on the phone, welcome, Tom, that we ask the administration to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6309.75s">take</a> the time to put this flowchart together in a way that is easy to understand and visual and lends itself to being able to be read by a screen reader, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6319.477s">And</a> that that become a communication piece rather than like the school committee necessarily needing to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6327.823s">I</a> think that's a better precedent for us to set. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6331.165s">And</a> I think the other thing that <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6332.786s">I'm</a> super sensitive to with flowcharts is I do this work a lot with people and there are lots and lots of people in the world who can't read flowcharts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6340.772s">And</a> so you either can or you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6343.233s">And</a> if you can't, you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6344.714s">And</a> like, there's just like no, no navigating around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6347.456s">I</a> will also point out that flowcharts are incredibly hard for screen readers to process. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6353.38s">Um,</a> they'd have, it'd have to be extensively all tagged and it would be near impossible to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6358.423s">There's</a> probably another kind of visual that would lend itself better to that, which I assume that our new communications director would be able to work through in advance and present it to us instead of having us have to discuss how it might happen on the floor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6403.825s">Okay,</a> so I am still, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6406.681s">I</a> can't believe I am still looking for my agenda, which is literally lost in the abyss of my computer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6463.311s">Yeah,</a> let me check again. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6464.192s">Oh,</a> there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6465.052s">There</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6465.472s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6467.733s">Okay,</a> number five negotiations and legal matters executive session continued from June 28 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6473.757s">Executive</a> session pursuant to master law section 30A, number three, the Medford school committee will convene an executive session to discuss strategy and preparation for negotiations with Teamsters local 25 security monitors and local 25 administrators and custodians because an open meeting will have a detrimental effect on the bargaining position of the committee and the chair so declares. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6494.329s">Item</a> two, executive session pursuant to master law section 30A, A2, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6499.633s">The</a> Medford School Committee will convene an executive session to discuss and review open administrator contracts of all non-unit personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6506.774s">And</a> item number three, executive session pursuant to Mass General Law 30A, A4. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6512.335s">The</a> Medford School Committee will convene an executive session to discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices or strategies with respect thereto. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6518.857s">The</a> Medford School Committee will not reconvene in public session subsequent to the executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=6524.798s">Do</a> I have a motion to enter executive session?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1030.297s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1030.657s">So</a> the reason that it appears in the section that you're referring to is because we heard from caregivers in particular that very often, and whether it's too often or not, I think is a question for another day, but the conclusion or the finding will come back that it is not bullying, but it is conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1051.747s">And</a> we really pressed the administrators to be clear with us about what does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1058.888s">What</a> is the difference between conflict and bullying? <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1062.309s">And</a> that is where that nuance comes in about sort of social power and recurrence and repeatedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1070.07s">And</a> what we're trying to do in that section is talk about what this looks like in practice so that people can start to understand that conflict doesn't mean it's not serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1081.473s">it</a> just means that it doesn't rise to the level of bullying under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1084.675s">So</a> that is why it appears in that section really to try to sort of thread the needle between the difference between bullying and conflict because there are lots and lots and lots of times where the findings come back and the finding is that this isn't bullying, it's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1101.887s">And</a> I think that's really confusing to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1103.688s">And</a> so that was why we were trying to clear that up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1140.659s">I</a> think that- I'm not seeing how that changes the scope personally, but, and we talked about this for like five meetings.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1822.915s">Yeah,</a> hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1824.737s">I</a> am not in favor of tabling this or delaying this in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1829.041s">I</a> think all policies are such that they are open to review and revision and changes at any point in time and that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1840.211s">But</a> to me the value of doing this right now is that the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1844.975s">needs</a> to implement this policy with some fidelity, which is something that has been sorely lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1850.52s">And</a> the longer that we wait to fully approve this policy, the longer it goes before she can begin her planning to make sure that every single administrator knows what their role is in this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1861.229s">It</a> is different in terms of the expectations of our staff, and it is not going to be a small undertaking to get <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1869.455s">500</a> and something people lined up and working in the same direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1872.957s">So</a> I am absolutely not in favor of tabling this any further, because I don't think there's anything substantive that's going to materially change the implementation work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1882.803s">And</a> if there are small things that need to change, subsequent policy revision is always a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=1888.387s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2595.64s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2596.981s">Yeah,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2597.741s">I</a> also wonder if you can recirculate to us the position description, because maybe there is something about the way the position's being described that can be adjusted, especially like our last assistant superintendent of finance and operations had a very broad scope of responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2616.67s">And</a> I guess the question is whether that continues to be <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2622.437s">what</a> we must have or what we would like to have and where does the position description sort of describe the set of responsibilities to perhaps be more appealing to candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2633.506s">So</a> if you could send that around, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2637.409s">And</a> then my other question about the budget was, what does this budget account for in terms of increases for non-unit employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2650.163s">So</a> in other words, is there money in the budget for compensation increases for non-unit employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2655.125s">And</a> if so, how much?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2685.723s">But</a> is it a 2% compensation increase for non-unit employees, or is it something else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2830.018s">Member</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2835.644s">So</a> before I make a motion to approve this budget, I just want to reiterate that this budget is really fragile and it is going to require <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2849.298s">really</a> sharp management of every single penny that's being spent in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2854.341s">That</a> includes contractors, consultants, everybody, how we bring new folks on board, what their salaries are, like every last penny is gonna need to be watched very carefully over the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2868.549s">And</a> we cannot be on June 28th next year, <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2875.033s">At</a> a point where we're just finally able to approve the budget because we have a just a tremendous amount of work to do with the exhaustion of Esther there's 28 people on Esther funds and that work has to start as quickly as it possibly can to really look at the organization structure and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2894.457s">ourselves,</a> what about this structure serves students and what doesn't, so that we can start to make decisions that are in the best interest of students and deal with the reality of coming off of an amount of money that is just no longer going to be available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2914.792s">will</a> be in the fall putting forward a series of resolutions to make sure that this work is happening proactively. <a href="https://youtu.be/FpP3QZeb9RA&t=2919.518s">And</a> in the meantime, I, with lots of hesitation in my heart, make a motion to approve the budget.<h2><a href="../2023-06-15_lxGqRLo36-s/2023-06-15_lxGqRLo36-s.html">MSC - Special Meeting & Executive Session - 06.14.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=122.142s">May</a> I remember Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=124.847s">Um,</a> we voted our municipal request at our June 5th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=132.669s">So</a> we voted on to send a request to the municipality for $71,995,165. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=139.79s">There</a> were six in favor, one abstention. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=145.731s">Um,</a> so that work has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=148.072s">The</a> next vote we would need to take is once the municipal allocation is <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=154.278s">formally</a> approved by put forward by the mayor and approved by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=159.723s">And</a> that has not happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lxGqRLo36-s&t=161.184s">So</a> I don't believe there's really anything for us to discuss until that happens because we don't know what that number will be.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1411.092s">Is</a> there software that other districts use to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1413.803s">Like</a> in any other facet of... <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1416.553s">the</a> world, there would be a software solution that supports this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1419.934s">So</a> what do schools use?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1454.387s">And</a> I think this question is for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1456.468s">I</a> know that you're actively hiring and recruiting for assistant principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/AyMsYF9M5k8&t=1460.37s">Are</a> there questions being asked about experience with scheduling for those APs that are being interviewed right now?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5455.526s">Are</a> you all plugged into the next gen MCAS piloting that's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5460.25s">I</a> think Winchester is participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5463.293s">And</a> we went to, Paul and I, Member Ruseau and I went to Day on the Hill, and Senator Jalen invited us to have lunch with her, and there were some students from Winchester who joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5477.578s">And</a> it was so fascinating to hear them talk about participating in this pilot and how much they liked the assessments that they were doing because they were useful and encouraged critical thinking and project-based, which is frankly like life instead of taking a test. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5498.354s">And</a> then we have the whole like, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5501.036s">It</a> does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5501.837s">And</a> you throw it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5503.679s">Some</a> people don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5504.699s">Some</a> people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5506.212s">I</a> just thought it was really fascinating to hear these seniors talk about the impact and the value and the fact that they liked these assessments and how different it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5516.558s">So</a> I was just curious if we're going to try to plug into that at all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=5547.063s">And</a> I think I have some information that Senator Jalen sent, so I will share it with you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6415.086s">Member</a> Graham, I just wanted to say thank you and I'm also really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6420.71s">I</a> think, you know, my kids are in middle school and one is about to go to high school, but I've really seen a huge transformation at the elementary level for sure in the rigor and the quality of the curriculum that we're using, which is hugely impactful. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6436.46s">I</a> think it's also happening at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6438.322s">I</a> think it's happening at the high school level because we approved new textbooks, but I just don't get to see it firsthand yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6443.405s">So</a> I'll refer it back next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6445.747s">But</a> it's really impressive, and it's one of those good news stories so I'm hoping that we can find some ways to highlight all the good curriculum work we're doing on the website in the coming year because I don't think our website does justice to the really high quality curricula we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6461.98s">And</a> I think our competitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6463.401s">If</a> you think about us in competition, they do that and they do it well and effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6468.866s">So</a> I think there's lots of good work doing and being done and we need to start to tell that story. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6475.653s">And</a> so, you know, we've talked about the communications director. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6478.176s">I'm</a> excited for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6480.247s">And</a> the last thing I'll say is we can approve curriculum, but I will make a motion to receive this port and place it on file with excitement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=6490.263s">And</a> hope I have a second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8382.128s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8383.969s">I</a> actually had some suggestions for the calendar between January and March. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8389.933s">um</a> we are going to see several new members of the school committee at minimum um and so I would like to see us provide a little bit of space in the January time frame that would allow us to do training and onboarding and all kinds of um start up things for our new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8406.938s">There'll</a> be at least two of them because my chair mates here are leaving us um but I so what I'd like to suggest is we meet on January 8th as this lists and then um <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8419.835s">make</a> some changes from what is on the calendar as on this list as January 22nd to March 18th and instead we meet on January 9th, February 12th, February 26th, March 11th, and March 25th and that creates some space so nothing is two weeks in a row but it also creates some space in January that we can use to dedicate to onboarding our new members however many however many there may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8449.468s">sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8450.168s">Um</a> so January 8th would remain and then January twenty-ninth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8454.271s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8456.433s">January</a> twenty-ninth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8458.994s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8459.355s">Um</a> February twelve, February twenty-six, March eleven, and March twenty-five, and then we would pick up with April schedule as listed.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8492.295s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8493.035s">February</a> 12 is the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8494.817s">February</a> 26 is the second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8536.918s">I</a> think it's going to be necessary to onboard new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8542.319s">I</a> think that was the impetus as I looked at the calendar because there will be at least two new members to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xUWwawkUrmE&t=8550.941s">Member</a> McLaughlin.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2463.967s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2465.087s">Thank</a> you to the board for having us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2467.188s">Kirsten</a> Braun, I'm the traffic engineer for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2470.83s">And</a> I work for Chapel engineering and associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2474.158s">So</a> we did perform a traffic analysis as well as parking analysis for this site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2480.023s">One</a> important thing to note that I think Katie brought up a lot is there was previously a supermarket on the site, and generally shopping centers of this size will include a supermarket so it doesn't necessarily mean that re adding a supermarket is going to result in a significant amount of trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2498.169s">At</a> any rate though, we did look at the increase in traffic associated with adding in the supermarket and the increases are not significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2507.597s">And</a> that's for two reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2509.819s">One</a> of which is a lot of people when they go to a supermarket, they're on their way home, on their way to work, on their way to run some sort of other errand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2517.545s">And</a> what they'll do is they'll swing through and go to the supermarket on their way to somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2521.868s">So</a> technically that traffic already exists on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2525.112s">The</a> second reason is a lot of people too when they go to shopping centers, they won't necessarily only stop at H Mart, they might also go to another store within the shopping center. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2535.864s">So</a> while that is two trips within the shopping center, it's really only one trip on the adjacent roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2543.732s">So</a> those are the real two main reasons why, you know, traffic isn't going to increase that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2548.953s">Another</a> thing to note that we didn't take a credit for in our study also is the fact that this is such a great area for walkability, bikeability, transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2560.416s">So</a> we didn't take any sort of credits for that kind of activity on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2564.757s">But</a> we probably do expect, given this location, that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2570.518s">a</a> decent amount of those types of trips, but we didn't take any sort of credit for those mode splits. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2575.782s">But</a> really, essentially, supermarkets within shopping centers don't result in a significant increase in trips because of all the various reasons that I had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2592.847s">And</a> I can answer any other specific questions related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2597.992s">But</a> that's just sort of a gist of the traffic study and what kind of traffic increases we can expect.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2681.886s">We</a> also separately took a look at parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2684.668s">And</a> what we did is we counted the parking demand on site during peak periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2690.452s">So</a> it's for shopping centers, it's typically midday. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2692.814s">And</a> we did find that the existing parking lots are currently very underutilized as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2700.039s">So</a> we don't expect a parking issue associated with the supermarket, even when we layer that traffic on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2706.703s">And</a> also Katie had mentioned something earlier as well that a lot of the uses within the shopping center have different types of peaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2713.887s">You</a> know, coffee shops are morning, grocery stores might be midday. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2718.749s">Some</a> of the restaurants are probably, you know, between the 7 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2724.132s">hours.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2724.532s">So</a> it's really actually a good situation and that there's such a mix of uses on site that all their peak parking demand hours are all very different.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2985.797s">Yeah,</a> I would just like to second what you are stating, David. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2990.9s">I</a> think I would be more comfortable if the proponent could digest the comments, consider them, <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3001.428s">and</a> then come back and see how much they can respond to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3005.672s">I</a> think it's a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3008.775s">It's</a> a wonderful opportunity to bring a grocer like this to our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3013.559s">However,</a> it also presents other opportunities to improve what is a pretty rough looking area and the pedestrian safety is definitely of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3027.446s">But</a> also as you know a good community member I would like to also see the opportunity to clean up the edges and improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3038.995s">landscaping,</a> but primarily the pedestrian safety and really be clear about what's going on with traffic and how best to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3048.399s">Understanding</a> that this site was originally a supermarket, you know, if that was in the 90s, I think, you know, fast forward, here we are 30 years later, let's just be clear about what has changed in the city.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3121.423s">I</a> would just like to add to that though. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3123.526s">I</a> would like to see as a board member what your best faith effort in responding to department comments about offsite mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3131.477s">That's</a> what we need to evaluate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3134.901s">How</a> do you respond so we can make a recommendation?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3225.261s">No,</a> that was a fair response and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3227.442s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2023-06-06_yB-9Wmg_zjs/2023-06-06_yB-9Wmg_zjs.html">MSC - Committee of the Whole - Evaluation 06.5.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=499.939s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=501.36s">We</a> met over the course of several meetings and most recently on Thursday night to <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=507.642s">compile</a> the superintendent's composite evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=512.145s">So</a> as a reminder to anyone who might be listening, we as the school committee are collectively in charge of the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=523.171s">And</a> that means we must coalesce by a majority vote on a single evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=528.173s">So</a> the way that we do that here in Medford, and I think in general, <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=532.956s">is</a> that all members of the committee spend some time thinking about the same exact evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=539.784s">We</a> all do our own individual evaluation and then we roll up and consolidate each of the seven individual evaluations into one cohesive evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=550.235s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=551.295s">I</a> think the important thing to note is that the individual evaluations certainly are available to the superintendent, but they are relatively meaningless in the big scheme of what evaluation it is that goes to Desi. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=563.948s">So</a> what we have done is work to take seven and become one, and we'll talk about that as we go through tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=573.337s">I</a> think the other important thing to note is that as we do that, what we have done is try to take a pretty careful and planned approach to representing a bunch of differing views on the various components of the evaluation, as well as represent and be clear and transparent about <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=594.632s">how</a> those individual scores affected the ultimate recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=597.875s">So,</a> as we, as we progress through the form, it'll look the same as what you all saw when you did your individual evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=606.822s">We</a> did, Sharon did, member Hays did go in and put the distribution of scores across each of the rankings so you can see sort of where the committee was at in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=618.05s">And</a> then the comments are left somewhat <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=623.433s">intact</a> so we we opted to represent the comments made by the committee so that we could represent a full picture because we didn't all agree on everything all the time and we felt like the comments were substantive and thoughtful and we wanted to make sure that they were provided to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=642.438s">And</a> then ultimately at the end of this, we'll need to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=645.359s">And</a> this is the committee of the whole, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=647.94s">So</a> we will need to take a vote on committee of the whole, and then we will need to take a vote next week in our regular school committee meeting to approve the evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=655.983s">And</a> then those final composite scores get submitted to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=660.525s">The</a> comments and all of that really don't go to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=663.106s">It's</a> really just that composite score. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=665.727s">But</a> the conversation that we'll have tonight is really about the superintendent's performance over the course of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=671.325s">from</a> our perspective and from our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=674.827s">And</a> the goal is for us to all agree on a single evaluation that represents the view of quote, the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=682.01s">Does</a> that help everyone set the stage and the frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=685.632s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=686.153s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=687.233s">Do</a> we have a copy to pull up that we could all take a look at?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=705.681s">What</a> you can see here is Desi's suggested template, and we each filled out one that looks exactly like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=714.663s">But</a> what we have done here is make a consolidated one that will represent ultimately the review of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=722.745s">And</a> so we'll just go step-by-step through this form, and I'll stop at the end of each section and we can talk, discuss, <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=730.359s">make</a> updates, field questions, and that kind of thing as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=733.803s">But</a> in step one, we are talking about assessment towards goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=738.007s">So</a> as a reminder, the superintendent presented a series of goals to us back in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=742.852s">We</a> unanimously approved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=744.453s">There's</a> three categories, professional practice goal, a student learning goal, and a district improvement goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=750.686s">So</a> for each of those goals, DESE requires that we, or recommends that we evaluate the superintendent on a five point scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=760.215s">So</a> from did not meet to exceeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=764.499s">And</a> what you can see here across each of the lines is what the distribution of rankings was across the seven members. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=774.788s">So</a> you can see each one adds up to seven, <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=777.697s">And</a> for example, in the professional practice goal, one person thought significant progress had been made, five thought that the superintendent had met her goal, and one thought that she had exceeded the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=793.91s">In</a> this particular category, step one, which is the particular goals that we approved unanimously, <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=800.325s">it's</a> the recommendation of the evaluation subcommittee that MET be submitted for each of these three goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=807.588s">And</a> what you can see is that the majority of folks did suggest that MET was the right qualifier for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=816.231s">And</a> then I think in places where there was some variability, we still recommend that MET be the school committee ranking for these three goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=828.58s">based</a> on the distribution of the ones that were not strictly met. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=835.087s">Are</a> there any questions about the items in step one?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=879.267s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=879.987s">Any</a> other questions or comments about or objections on the first component? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=887.071s">Step</a> one? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=889.557s">Okay,</a> if you can scroll down a little bit, Dr. Cushing, that's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=894.304s">So</a> step two, we'll talk about this at the composite level, and then we'll get into a little bit of detail, particularly as we look at the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=904.758s">So,</a> essentially, this is what this is the level of information that gets provided to Desi about the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=911.063s">So,</a> as member Rousseau was saying, there are goals and there are standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=915.367s">They</a> are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=917.229s">Goals</a> are something that are established uniquely here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=921.492s">Standards</a> are a series of attributes that Desi has established are important for superintendents to <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=930.851s">to</a> have and to exhibit as they complete their role on a year to year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=937.754s">So</a> those standards fall into four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=941.176s">So</a> standard number one is instructional leadership, standard number two is management and operations, standard number three is family and community engagement, and then standard four is professional culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=951.804s">So,</a> the scale changes here a little bit so we had a five point scale and step one, and as member so said maybe someday we'll have the same kind of scale and in both places but in this in this section and then really for the rest of the review. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=966.576s">We,</a> we will see a four point scale unsatisfactory needs improvement proficient and exemplary. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=973.666s">When</a> we get to the comments, what will be important to remember as we talk about comments is that members are required to provide comments if they provide a ranking other than proficient, but if they are evaluating the superintendent as proficient, there is no requirement for comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=991.8s">So</a> in this case, what you can see is under instructional leadership, we unanimously agreed that proficient was the appropriate rank, the appropriate evaluation decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1002.211s">Under</a> management and operations, we had two members who said needs improvements, five who said proficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1008.536s">Under</a> family and community engagement, we had one that said needs improvement and six that said proficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1014.401s">And</a> then under standard four, professional culture, we had one that said needs improvement and six that said proficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1021.026s">So</a> it was the recommendation of the evaluation subcommittee that proficient be submitted to DESE on behalf of each of these four standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1030.589s">Are</a> there any questions about step two? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1032.271s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1034.194s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1036.538s">And</a> then in step three, we roll all of those things up together into one single number. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1044.53s">We're</a> still on a four-point scale here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1046.547s">but</a> the overall summative performance based on the rankings and the evaluations in step one and step two, all seven of us unanimously agreed that Proficient was the appropriate aggregated summative performance recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1061.337s">So</a> in step three, we would plan to submit Proficient to the, to DESE on behalf of the committee if we take this ultimately to a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1076.684s">Questions</a> about step three. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1077.685s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1084.854s">In</a> step four, there's some. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1087.0s">comments</a> that pertain to the overall evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1090.621s">And</a> so these comments, as you can see, came from various members and the committee had some conversation around, should we be trying to compress these into one narrative? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1103.743s">Was</a> it important for them to sort of stand alone? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1106.484s">And</a> we, as a group, unanimously agreed that it was important for them to stand alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1111.585s">They</a> do represent <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1113.465s">slightly,</a> you know, different points of view and different takes on the same thing and I think that's the thing about any evaluation is that as objective as you try to be, there's still a very subjective part to somebody's performance evaluation and I think all of these comments, you know, in in the big scheme of things are intended to both compliment the superintendent on the things that she did well and also point out the places where we would like to see <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1140.495s">continued</a> growth on the part of the superintendent as it relates to certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1144.278s">So,</a> I think I'll give you all a minute to read through this provided you can all see the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1150.402s">Can</a> everyone see the screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1151.523s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1153.925s">So,</a> if everyone just wants to take a minute and read through, I think that probably is a good way to move through what are some media comments here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1238.717s">So</a> if you scroll down, what happens next in this form is <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1244.865s">And</a> I think as you fill it out for practical matters, you actually fill it out sort of in the reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1251.208s">Actually,</a> we've covered all of this section, so this is just a summary of exactly what we talked about, the three district goals at the top here that you saw up above. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1263.314s">And</a> it just provides a little bit more information about what those goals were, which is really a very short summary of an otherwise pretty in-depth set of information about what those goals were. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1274.56s">The</a> student learning goal was early literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1276.841s">The</a> professional practice goal was leading now sessions with MASS on race, equity, diversity, and inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1287.186s">They're</a> called ready sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1288.847s">District</a> improvement goal number one was maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1294.95s">District</a> goal number two is creating a culture that values consistent communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1299.632s">And</a> district improvement goal number three was creating structures that promote healthy transportation to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1305.262s">And</a> so you can see here, again, the distribution all sort of coalesces around MET. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1312.509s">So,</a> sorry, we're back to five categories here, just to make things very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1318.275s">So</a> we're back to five categories from did not meet to exceed, but the committee did coalesce again around that MET score for these schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1362.701s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1365.105s">Dr.</a> Cushing, can you scroll down? <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1368.911s">Okay,</a> so this next section is where we go back to our standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1375.816s">And</a> in each standard, we have a series of options that are presented to us, and they would, I think, represent what we would consider to be the whole job under this particular standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1390.627s">Um</a> but what the what DESE encourages school committees to do is to pick one or two focused indicators um and base the entire evaluation of this component around those one or two or maybe possibly three um focused indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1409.496s">So</a> the our focused indicators are highlighted in yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1413.078s">They</a> are the only things that this committee um <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1416.192s">did</a> evaluate the superintendent based on, so her composite score for instructional leadership is based on two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1425.196s">It's</a> 1B, which is ensures that practices in all settings reflect high expectations regarding content and quality of effort and work, engage all students, and are personalized to accommodate diverse learning styles, needs, interests, and levels of readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1441.537s">I-3,</a> sorry, I-E, is data-informed decision-making, uses multiple sources of evidence, including related to student learning, including state, district, and school assessment results and growth data to inform school and district goals and improve organizational performance, educator effectiveness, and student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1461.104s">So</a> those were the two goals that we met and unanimously agreed were the things that most closely aligned to the goals that we had set out for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1468.589s">And</a> you can see the scores there pretty unanimously proficient is the the ranking and evaluation there. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1476.915s">There</a> are some comments here that are specific to instructional leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1481.738s">So</a> there are three comments here, or actually, I'm sorry, two comments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1486.121s">So</a> I'll give you all a minute to read those.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1517.277s">If</a> you scroll down standard number two is management and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1521.56s">We</a> selected one focus indicator here it was environment, which is develops and executes effective plans procedures routines and operational systems to address the full range of safety, health, emotional and social needs, and the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1538.163s">ultimately</a> rated this entire section five people saying met two people saying needs improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1544.79s">And</a> then if you can scroll down a little bit more Dr. Cushing, there's a series of comments there that I will pause for you all to read.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1706.052s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1706.673s">So</a> we can take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1708.396s">And</a> before the final is presented just to clean up that conflict, but good catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1713.323s">I</a> did not notice that the other day when we were going through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1716.488s">So</a> Dr. Cushing, can you scroll down and let everyone read the comments there?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1909.021s">Is</a> there a motion to amend?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1953.954s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1955.899s">On</a> to standard number three, which is family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1963.244s">As</a> you can see, we elected for three focus indicators under family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1968.827s">So</a> the first is actively ensures that all families are welcome members of the classroom and school community and can contribute to the effectiveness of the classroom school district and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1977.973s">The</a> second is continuously collaborates with families and community stakeholders to support student learning and development at home school and in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1986.678s">And</a> then the third is engages in regular two-way culturally proficient communication with family and community stakeholders about student learning and performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=1997.167s">So</a> again, here, the committee is recommending, as we talked about in step two earlier, that MET is the metric that is submitted for the standard number three family and community engagement based on these scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2012.503s">And</a> then Dr. Cushing, if you can scroll down just a little bit so that people can see those comments, that would be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2077.441s">Okay,</a> let's move on to standard for professional culture commitment to high standards was the first focus indicator that we chose. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2086.433s">fosters</a> a shared commitment to high standards of service teaching and learning with high expectations and achievements for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2093.522s">The</a> committee, the committee unanimously said that the second focus indicator cultural proficiency was also important to us to share ensures that policies and practices enable staff members and students to interact effectively in a culturally diverse environment in which students backgrounds identities strengths and challenges are respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2113.078s">And</a> then the third component was managing conflict, employee strategies for responding to disagreement and dissent, constructively resolving conflict and building consensus throughout the district or school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2124.143s">And</a> again here, the consensus among the evaluation subcommittee and the committee at large was that the overall rating here was a six. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2137.829s">six,</a> four, sorry, six, four met and one, four needs improvement and you can see the individual standards throughout and what those scores are. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2149.036s">Doctor</a> Cushing, if you could scroll down, there's a series of comments about about this standard number four professional culture as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2212.376s">So</a> I think I will turn it back over to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yB-9Wmg_zjs&t=2219.081s">I</a> don't know if there's additional discussion or a motion.<h2><a href="../2023-06-06_CftWif4v9Wc/2023-06-06_CftWif4v9Wc.html">MSC Public Budget Hearing & Special Meeting - 06.05.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=980.107s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=980.627s">So</a> I think there's two things happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=984.767s">We</a> have to, as a committee, coalesce around <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=988.932s">request</a> to the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=991.553s">So,</a> that's one thing that's happening but I think separately, we also asked the superintendent for some clarity around what would it look like if we had to get to $71 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1004.078s">So,</a> on item number two, I have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1007.08s">So,</a> the our the budget you recommended was 71 835 165. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1018.359s">two</a> ELA coaches, a specialist in the Parent Information Center, converting the library aids to librarians, and one FTE for theater at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1029.265s">So</a> within the 71.8 and change, there was $480,000 that represents new things that we will do next year, which is in addition to other new things we're gonna do next year that are outside of the operating budget because they're gonna be funded by ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1043.413s">And</a> we've talked about that in prior presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1046.846s">So,</a> I think my question is, I am a little confused, but when you say total deductions based on FY24 recommendations, the slide said 835,000, which is basically like the discrepancy between what you recommended and the $71 million that the mayor's previously indicated, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1070.175s">But</a> then minus 480, <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1072.759s">which</a> is essentially the new things that we're going to do under the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1077.6s">And</a> it says $355,000 to be covered by ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1078.86s">So</a> 835 minus 480, 355. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1079.281s">I</a> think my question is like, are we, so we're assuming then that we, of the $525,000 left in ESSER, that we can identify $355,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1102.406s">in</a> operating expenses that could be paid for by sir is that true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1106.791s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1180.421s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1181.142s">And</a> what are the five FTEs that are moving out of the operating budget and into ESSER?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1220.305s">And</a> are those positions permissible under ESSER rules to be covered by ESSER?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1229.395s">And</a> is that because we perceive that they are one year expenditures? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1235.921s">Or</a> that they are needed because of the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1239.198s">I</a> know that we're already paying for BCBAs and adjustment Councilors on ESSER, so we're saying we're adding more BCBAs and adjustment Councilors to ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1249.604s">But</a> the language teachers sort of surprised me because I don't, I'm not sure if they are needed positions in a continuous way, how do they apply to ESSER? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1260.31s">Or</a> how do they qualify, I guess is my question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1296.969s">So</a> then what we're saying is, out of the 525,000, 355 can be used to pay for these five positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1303.212s">So</a> that's 355 out of the 835. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1319.144s">that</a> can be covered by ESSER and that leaves $170,000 which also allows us to cover two coaches, two ELA coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1329.687s">So</a> that's 160. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1330.047s">But</a> if you take the 480 of the new minus 160, there's still $320,000 of recommended investments listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1334.648s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1349.46s">So</a> for it and that would include the PIC specialist converting the library aids and the theater teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1355.782s">So</a> that's where $320,000 comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1358.502s">So</a> I think what I am not clear on is how is the $320,000 going to be paid for if you're saying that's how we would get to 71? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1367.325s">Because</a> I think there's still $320,000 unpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1368.865s">So</a> is it really 71 or is it 71, 320 that we have gotten to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1388.05s">So</a> meaning we would not do those things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1391.903s">We</a> would not get a theater teacher, we would not get a pick specialist, and we would not convert our life library aids to librarians. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1399.608s">That</a> is how you would get to 7100 71 million.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1405.491s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1406.731s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1407.992s">I</a> think I'm with you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1409.033s">So,</a> I think, you know, in terms of the two things that we have to do tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1417.341s">Certainly</a> talking about what our request municipal government is going to be as a committee, I think, is really important, but I also think. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1425.806s">You</a> know, considering with clarity that that the way that we would get to $71 million would mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1433.919s">creating</a> a scheduling issue at the elementary school level, because my understanding was that library block changing was a requirement to make the scheduling work next year at the elementary school, that we would have to find some other way to offer theater programming next year or not offer it at all, and that the pick would continue to be understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1455.549s">So</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1457.025s">when</a> we get to the part and I for me, I think I would like to talk about one and then the other if we could when we get to deliberation after we hear from the community but those are those are significant trade-offs and those are significant things we would not be able to do in order to get to that $71 million and II know you know that but I'm just trying to make sure I we're all clear on what getting to $71 million looks like and also to say <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1486.633s">using</a> ESSER money and now we're going to go up to 33 people so we have 33 staff members being paid for by grant funding that will not be there next year and that is a that is a huge number so we need to be mindful of the impact and we may not have a choice this year but the impact of that is just kicking the can down the road and <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1511.604s">I</a> think my committee members know, my fellow colleagues know that I hate doing that because I think it just sets up problems that are bigger than just, you know, delaying one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1522.471s">So</a> I just want to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1526.294s">I</a> wanted to make sure I was clear about what everything said as it stepped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1532.458s">And</a> I look forward to hearing from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=1535.56s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4895.488s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4896.948s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for everyone who came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4900.789s">I</a> didn't expect this many people to be here, so I lost a bet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4905.03s">So</a> thank you, but thank you for being here because the room should always be this full. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4911.607s">I</a> think we heard a lot of really good, passionate points tonight, and I think we all have really high expectations and hopes for our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4922.532s">A</a> couple of things I'm particularly hopeful about is we have just hired three new female principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4930.456s">Marta</a> Cabral will be the first female principal of Medford High ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4935.982s">She's</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4937.683s">I</a> have such high hopes for Medford High under her leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4942.645s">I</a> know she's already in close communication with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4945.507s">I</a> also know Malden High had to reindate their graduation, so you won't get to meet her tonight, I don't think, because she has to organize and execute Malden High graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4957.612s">To</a> the point that we need to work together to understand what the city needs <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4963.382s">I</a> am in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4965.163s">I</a> think this group, this committee has worked really hard for the four years that I've been here to authentically describe what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4972.605s">That</a> was really never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4974.405s">And</a> that has been a collective effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4977.326s">It</a> has included the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4978.967s">It</a> has never been easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4981.807s">And</a> I wanna acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4984.468s">I</a> would like to make a motion for consideration of the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4989.089s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to request <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4992.347s">to</a> make our request to the municipal government in the amount of $71,995,165. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4994.909s">The</a> request includes the superintendent's request of $71,835,165 and the addition of two more literacy coaches to equal four in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=4999.493s">We've</a> had a lot of conversation about literacy coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5016.291s">Further,</a> the requested amount, when paired with the remaining ESSER funding, if the full request is funded, will provide us the capacity not only to hire four literacy coaches, a new person in the Parent Information Center, to convert our librarians to librarians, to add a theater teacher, but it will also allow us the bandwidth and the capacity to fully implement the climate recommendations of <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5043.157s">the</a> report from Mr. Michael Welch in a variety of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5050.558s">So</a> that is the motion I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5053.019s">If</a> you need me to repeat it, I'm happy to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5069.702s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5070.741s">The</a> additional amount is effectively $160,000 to include the two more literacy coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5079.046s">So,</a> it's the superintendent's number on the first page of your packet, 71835165 plus 160,000 to equal 71995165. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5083.508s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5084.008s">May</a> I make an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5085.689s">I'm</a> going to propose an amendment to that resolution.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5284.509s">I</a> agree that we need to do all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5287.17s">I</a> think we have a unique funding opportunity for those items because all of those programs run out of our revolving funds, and so they do not have to be part of this request in order for us to fund them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5299.357s">But</a> I think instead, <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5300.902s">what</a> we may wanna do is request that the superintendent provide us a report of how many of those folks are planned for summer fund, for after school, for next year, et cetera, and whether there is sufficient money in the revolving accounts, if there are none planned to add, so that it doesn't, it's not $50,000 in the operating budget, because all of that, all of those expenses really do need to sit in the revolving accounts, and there very likely is adequate funding there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5330.069s">to</a> say that this is a priority and we should do it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5376.914s">Superintendent</a> member Graham is that is it possible for you to provide us some sort of brief report next Monday about this topic, particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5387.683s">Particularly</a> interested in summer fun, because it is imminent and whether the revolving account can support bcba support for summer fun this upcoming summer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5624.618s">I</a> just, I wanted to say unequivocally that as you have this conversation about what override is needed in my, I feel the pain of $3 million easily right here in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5637.684s">So</a> I know that we probably need much, much more than that, but as soon as we're ready to start that conversation, count me in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5645.922s">I</a> will knock every door in the city myself if I need to to pass an override because I think as a city, we deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5652.844s">So,</a> I already counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5654.325s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5655.425s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5655.925s">Um</a> but II did want to say and I think, you know, this is a great point for everybody listening and who has come to participate tonight like it there there is only so much that we can do in the right now but what we can do is plan for the future and so I think we have to sort of balance both of those <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5674.514s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CftWif4v9Wc&t=5675.355s">Roll</a> call vote, please.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=42.621s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules and take items 7.2.3 and .4 out of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=55.798s">7.2,</a> 7.3, and 7.4 on that order, Superintendent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=988.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=988.499s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=992.841s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=994.062s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you in particular to all the students coming out tonight to talk about this really awesome product. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1002.708s">I</a> had never heard of that product before, and I think it's a really great solution to the reasons why we haven't followed through on the multiple ways that we've asked for these products to be available to you all since before I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1021.752s">Before</a> I was on the school committee I worked with a student at the high school to come forward and present just like you all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1027.62s">And</a> at that time, the school committee was unanimous in their support we've seen at least two other presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1035.703s">since</a> then. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1036.503s">So</a> my apologies that we haven't gotten this right, but thank you to all of you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1044.166s">This</a> makes compliance with all the past school committee resolutions that were unanimous and the law that much easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1052.449s">This</a> seems very straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1054.17s">I'm</a> in full support. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1055.831s">And</a> I would like to make a motion to ask the administration to implement these immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1062.228s">and</a> at maximum by the start of next school year in our high schools and our middle school complexes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1726.572s">So</a> the motion is to implement these devices in all of our high school, middle school and upper elementary bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1739.995s">and</a> review the possibility of putting them in some of the individual classroom bathrooms as appropriate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1759.505s">Should</a> we roll, are you asking, should we roll call?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=2402.475s">Motion</a> to revert to the regular order of business.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=2415.001s">Are</a> the attorneys waiting for us though?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=2478.238s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5546.028s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5580.99s">Motion</a> to approve the minutes from section six, items B, E, F, and G. Do you mean A, B, C, D? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5591.539s">Yes,</a> we have two different versions, yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5619.148s">Motion</a> to waive the updates.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5624.811s">Yeah,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5740.011s">Motion</a> to approve the subcommittee minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5887.909s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5973.939s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5974.78s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=5975.76s">I</a> do think we have some rules in our rules handbook around onboarding and so we should use them as a starting point but II think they're, you know, that that is a good starting point and agree that we should start thinking about that and maybe early in the fall, create a one time subcommittee to deal with that.<h2><a href="../2023-05-23_-GdGrA4wKuQ/2023-05-23_-GdGrA4wKuQ.html">MSC - Evaluation Subcommittee Meeting - 05.22.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=119.637s">Member</a> Hays, do you want to call the roll first?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=966.223s">I</a> can't turn on my camera for reasons I don't understand, but I just didn't want you to think I was sitting here not paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=976.285s">I</a> am totally fine with that approach.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=992.156s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=993.136s">Yeah,</a> I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=995.357s">We</a> have two meetings scheduled to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=997.837s">So</a> yeah, that's just really a continuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1000.998s">We</a> might just at the end of the meeting, instead of motioning to adjourn, we might just motion to continue the meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1013.5s">But</a> the close out of the meeting, I think we call it something different.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1052.431s">And</a> so it would, instead of being a motion to adjourn, it would be a motion to continue the meeting on June 1st.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1207.092s">Yeah,</a> yeah, you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1208.653s">I</a> think I would just add to that, that this is a legal requirement for school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1216.017s">It's</a> one of the three responsibilities that are set out under the law for school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1222.12s">School</a> committees do have, just for your information, some latitude in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1227.182s">what</a> process they establish. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1230.983s">And</a> your point is well taken that perhaps in the future, we should think about a public input part of the process, because I think that's important to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1245.407s">So</a> just more to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1249.048s">The</a> process is laid out and how we submit the results is very defined, but we do have the latitude to outline the process itself that leads to that kind of standardized reporting to DESE that we have conducted this review. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1266.694s">So</a> there is some latitude there, and I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1269.992s">Jess's</a> point is well taken, that we should think about that for future, which would require some set of activity, like before this meeting in particular, so that we could hear that input and have a process for how we might include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1287.984s">So</a> I think just for your information, great suggestion, Jess. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1292.868s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1293.468s">we</a> should think about that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1294.989s">I</a> will also note that this is probably the earliest we've ever been able to have an organized process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1304.992s">The</a> last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress to doing this consistently and clearly, and this is just another step of progress, at least in the four years that I've been on the committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1348.931s">Member</a> Hays, I think somebody, Paul has his hand in the air, Paul Garrity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1356.263s">I</a> couldn't tell if you were clapping, Paul, or you had your hand up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1362.349s">I</a> think he needs to be able to be unmuted.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1444.375s">I</a> would also just say that that self-evaluation also included various forms of evidence that support the narrative that was provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1455.22s">And</a> so, for example, there were <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1459.625s">scores</a> from our map testing from last year and this year that were provided to us to provide evidence around the student learning goal, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1470.691s">So</a> there is both the superintendent's narrative and evidence that she provides. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1476.534s">And</a> I think also, you know, just <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1479.978s">sort</a> of our own like point of view and experience over the course of the year as we have been thinking about this evaluation and our work on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1489.946s">All</a> of that is part of what goes into everyone's individual ratings and rankings.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1523.871s">I</a> think the short answer is you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1526.652s">There</a> are seven individual members of the committee, all who <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1532.341s">have</a> different points of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1534.562s">And</a> this is the way that we start to coalesce to a single point of view that is our committee's view. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1540.963s">So</a> we all obviously are looking at the same evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1544.204s">We</a> may see that evidence differently because we may have had different deeper discussions and been working on things, you know, outside of committee meetings and <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1555.947s">and</a> what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1556.707s">So</a> the first step is for the committee to say individually and independently, this is how we are feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1563.008s">And</a> then the ultimate product here is the review that represents the committee's view by a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1575.27s">So</a> the recognition is that individuals are going to have their own perspective, and that's the starting point to coalesce to the review that gets approved.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1919.713s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1921.114s">Member</a> Hays, if I might, I just also want to express that this is the literal only place I've ever seen somebody's performance review be aired in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1933.08s">I</a> think it's incredibly awkward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1936.142s">I</a> think it's a problematic process for many, many, many reasons, which is probably why you don't see too many districts sort of blasting this information on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1948.709s">At</a> the end of the day, Dr Edouard-Vincent is our employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1952.916s">And</a> so we also have to be mindful that there are lots of employment laws at play. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1959.004s">And</a> we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1960.487s">So</a> we need to take care I think Mr. Gary to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1963.611s">to</a> sort of balance the fact that this is all public information and the fact that the superintendent is our employee and she does have rights as an employee of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1977.744s">So</a> that's the sticky part.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1998.576s">And</a> we can certainly do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1999.517s">I</a> mean, all the, the, um, the measures that were selected were selected in open meeting, but, um, maybe there's like a summary slide member Hays or something that can be put together to say, this was, this was the focus for this year.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_39QZXkKLDII/2025-06-26_39QZXkKLDII.html">Community Development Board 05-17-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=340.796s">OK,</a> so I thought I would start by describing what I tried to do in terms of the organization of the document, because we talked a lot about that component. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=357.144s">And</a> then I will just take us through section by section and point out some particular places where <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=365.63s">I</a> think we just need to make sure we're all in agreement with like how the evolution of the document has come along. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=372.553s">And</a> there are some particular places where I have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=377.715s">I</a> was able to integrate like all the notes from the minutes of things that were supposed to be added, removed, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=386.319s">I</a> added the links that member McLaughlin asked about in the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=391.001s">I</a> integrated comments from <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=393.583s">our</a> special ed attorneys that Joan provided that is all in this one document. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=399.369s">The</a> one thing that's not in here at the moment is the flowchart that we've been discussing and I think primarily because Peter did, Dr. Cushing did share with me a flowchart but <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=410.761s">I</a> wanted to make sure that we were all in agreement with what this document said, so that then I could go and take the final step of making sure that the flowchart lines up with what this document says before we put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=420.623s">Because</a> once the flowchart ends up in the document, it gets a little bit harder to manipulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=426.705s">So</a> that's sort of the starting point of reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=429.945s">And</a> then we removed lots of sections that we talked about being removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=434.386s">And</a> what I tried to do is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=437.373s">make</a> this substantially more simple than the prior document was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=442.558s">It's</a> certainly fewer pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=444.12s">I</a> think we're headed in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=448.364s">But</a> I will, unless anyone has any questions about any of that, I will just sort of scroll through and tell you what I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=456.832s">Does</a> that work for everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=459.577s">Okay,</a> so in this introduction, what this sets up is sort of our definition of bullying, which throughout the policy, there was like a lot of inconsistency of where we said bullying versus bullying or cyber bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=478.644s">There</a> were some inconsistent references to what happens when the bullying happens <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=482.785s">like</a> outside of school, but then impacts what happens inside of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=486.826s">So</a> the best way that I could come up with to sort of make this not duplicative and confusing was to set the frame at the beginning of the document that for the purposes of this policy, when we say bullying, we mean bullying, we mean cyber bullying, and we mean <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=505.072s">action</a> or activity that happens outside of school to the extent that it creates the same conditions within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=511.265s">So</a> just to sort of set that frame up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=515.268s">And</a> that sort of is what is here in this introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=519.109s">And</a> then if you see here, it also says at the bottom of this section, it says for the purposes of this policy, bullying will be used to broadly include cyber bullying and out of school behavior that leads to a hostile school environment in school throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=533.113s">So</a> just to sort of set that frame rather than trying to constantly be like adding all the right words in all the right places throughout the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=543.156s">The</a> other thing that I included in this introduction, based on some of our conversation and I would be interested for you all to weigh in on this, I pulled this out of the policy somewhere that talks about what conflict is and what I have heard repeatedly from parents is <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=560.398s">I</a> filed a bullying report and it was determined that it wasn't bullying, but it was conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=565.6s">And</a> I think that certainly in the community leads to lots of confusion about like what happens in these instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=573.483s">And</a> I'll show you a little bit later on sort of how I tried to define that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=577.464s">But</a> in this policy upfront, I felt like it was important to outline what conflict was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=585.232s">This</a> is largely the definition that existed in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=589.675s">I</a> would be interested if there are changes to this definition that would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=593.277s">So</a> it says conflict is an equal power quarrel or problem between two students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=598.561s">Investigations</a> may reveal that an incident or incidents are conflict rather than bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=603.124s">In</a> contrast, bullying is abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=604.805s">It</a> occurs when a socially powerful, popular or feared student mentally or physically abuses a weaker fearful student for the purpose of making them afraid and hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=614.672s">That</a> is pretty straight out of our prior policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=620.689s">I</a> don't personally love it, but I think it's important that we set the framework that there are lots of interactions and some of them rise to this like definition of bullying and some do get ultimately sort of classified as conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=636.116s">And</a> like, what does that even mean conflict in this situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=639.618s">So</a> I would be interested if anybody has any reaction to this definition of conflict that we could talk about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=990.431s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=991.632s">We're</a> moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=992.273s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=993.193s">So</a> the policy, what I did then was I took the section, the actual policy is like the next like meat of this document and just set up like at the top of the policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1010.353s">that</a> we do not condone acts of bullying of any kind, that we sort of set up that students and staff may not engage in bullying, that we prohibit retaliation, some of like the very big sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1027.43s">Headliners</a> there and then the way that I sort of broke out the policy was to talk about it in components, so that it's clear like what component of the policy we're talking about and try to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1042.948s">discrete</a> about things so that they only sort of ended up in one bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1046.63s">So,</a> for example, the first bucket is prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1049.492s">So</a> the law outlines quite a number of things that we must do from a prevention perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1055.395s">And</a> I actually did go back yesterday and reread the law to make sure all the components are in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1060.457s">So,</a> for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1061.964s">This</a> first paragraph, it says provide enhanced support, recognizing that certain students may be more vulnerable to become a target of bullying or harassment based on actual or perceived differentiating characteristics, including race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, socioeconomic status, homelessness, academic status, gender identity or expression, physical appearance, pregnancy or parenting status, sexual orientation, mental, physical, or developmental, or sensory disability, or by association with a person who has <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1088.977s">or</a> is perceived to have one or more of these characteristics. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1091.299s">That's</a> straight out of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1094.381s">But</a> I put this comment in here because the law goes on to say that this plan, which we are required to have, shall include specific steps that each school district, charter school, non-public school, private day school, whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1114.295s">shall</a> take to support vulnerable students and to provide all students with the skills, knowledge and strategies needed to prevent or respond to bullying or harassment and. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1124.85s">We</a> can come back to this at the end, but one question I had was, I did not see anything in our prior policy that really to me sounded like specific steps that we are taking to address this requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1139.979s">So</a> I'll just like put that bug in your ear now, and perhaps at the end, we can come back around to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1149.045s">Other</a> prevention items, the district will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying and intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1158.289s">The</a> district will provide annual notice as required by law on the plan and the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1165.003s">This</a> is what written written notice will include many, many, many of these bullets I don't want to read them all to you, but they these by and large come either out of our prior policy or directly out of the law, usually both because our prior policy was sort of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1183.163s">mash</a> up of the the model documents so that's where these like sort of big long list come from, and I think we can talk about how to best integrate comments and feedback after we go through all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1198.65s">Other</a> prevention items ensure district staff are aware of this policy that this policy requires that all staff will model interactions with others that demonstrate tolerance and respect for differences, even if the issues being discussed are controversial at all times when acting in the individual's professional capacity or representing Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1216.961s">This</a> idea was buried somewhere like, you know, 25 pages deep in our prior policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1224.905s">And</a> I thought it was really important to talk about from a prevention standpoint that we also are clearly describing to all of our staff that we expect <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1237.952s">You</a> know that they model good behavior that you know they model behavior that is consistent with this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1245.714s">You</a> know anytime they're acting in their professional capacity or as a representative of the district and then final prevention item post the approved bullying prevention and intervention policy on the NPS website so. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1257.498s">That</a> is the prevention section so. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1262.579s">Any</a> questions about broadly what I outlined there?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1456.788s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1458.029s">I</a> will integrate those comments that one of these bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1462.35s">Sorry,</a> this bullet that talks about staff training. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1466.412s">It</a> does have a whole list of things in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1469.373s">And</a> so what I will do is I will work <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1471.52s">Some</a> of these particulars into this component around staff professional development and and because it's it leads with age appropriate instruction curriculum so that I will put that all in there and consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1485.108s">I</a> think sufficient to address this requirement, so I think that should work nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1490.872s">Thank</a> you for that extra information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1494.794s">The</a> next session is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1496.095s">Did</a> I lose it? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1498.416s">Let's</a> see here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1507.928s">So</a> I start off, and what I try to do throughout is frame this in terms of what Medford Public Schools will do, because our policy talked about like things parents must do before, and the truth is like, we have no say. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1524.683s">We</a> cannot mandate parents do really anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1529.827s">And</a> the more important thing is that we as a district are clear on what our responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1534.63s">So</a> you'll see like all of these things lead off with Medford Public Schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1539.373s">And</a> I did that to broadly mean that this is a cohesive effort and I tried not to differentiate like what central administration would do versus what a principal would do in various ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1554.167s">if</a> the intent was broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1556.168s">So</a> hopefully that sort of works as you all get a chance to read and digest all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1562.751s">But</a> when it comes to incident reporting, Medford Public Schools will designate a person in each building who's responsible for receiving reports of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1571.556s">In</a> most cases, this will be the school principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1573.737s">In</a> all cases, the individual responsible for receiving reports will be listed in the school handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1579.719s">The</a> next bullet was actually something that I added in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1582.566s">I</a> wanted to make sure that we had some discussion about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1587.103s">I</a> know that we have talked multiple times about the bullying incidents that are related to athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1595.228s">And</a> I wanted to suggest for this group to consider that assistant principals will not be designated as the investigator for bullying reports that occur as the result of participation in an athletics or extracurricular program, because the reporting structure is such that those assistant principals <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1614.722s">don't</a> really have any authority over the athletics director or programming, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1621.544s">That</a> typically sits at a higher level. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1623.305s">So</a> I wanted to offer that to this group for some thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1628.006s">I</a> mean, I think that particularly is relevant at the high school, I think to some degree at the middle school, but I know that we have had a number of bullying-related situations <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1641.542s">reports</a> surrounding athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1644.683s">So</a> I wanted there to be, at least for me, I wanted there to be a clear distinction around how we handle reports of athletics bullying so that they are investigated thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1656.125s">So</a> I don't know what you all think about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1715.261s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1716.701s">And</a> actually this might belong somewhere else, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1721.034s">I</a> will make a note of that and we can circle back to that at the end.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1832.062s">And</a> I guess, you know, as I was thinking about this, I think these are all really good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1837.066s">What</a> I was thinking about was that <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1841.235s">these</a> situations might rise to the level of being appropriate to say the principal will be the investigator rather than the... So that's sort of where my head was at, was like, is this assistant principal work or is it principal work? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1857.243s">So</a> I don't know if you guys have thoughts about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1906.16s">But</a> this next bullet I think is really, these next two bullets are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1913.307s">So</a> one of the things that I think we've danced around a little bit as we have talked about this policy is <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1923.129s">I'll</a> say confusion on the part of parents about like, what do they have to do to start a bullying investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1933.217s">And</a> I think we've heard from lots of parents who say like, I've been reporting these things and then suddenly I get a form and this has been going on for months, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1944.406s">And</a> so why did I never get this form before now? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1946.968s">And</a> to me, as I thought about that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1949.43s">What</a> I think is happening is there's not clarity around what constitutes a bullying report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1957.693s">Is</a> it a form? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1959.254s">Is</a> it some amount of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1961.055s">What</a> is it that officially starts the clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1964.096s">And</a> I wanted this policy to be really, really clear about what starts that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1971.758s">So</a> I'm totally open to like what this sub bullet list is, but what this bullet says is Medford Public Schools will consider an allegation of bullying as submitted regardless of whether official forms are completed or if the allegation is anonymously reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1988.046s">An</a> allegation will be investigated as an official bullying report if the allegation is reported to a staff member and includes the below listed minimum information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=1997.17s">The</a> name and school of the target student, the name and school of the aggressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2002.433s">The</a> date and location of the incidents, a description of the incident that is believed to meet the criteria for bullying behavior and contact information for the reporter, which obviously required but not recommended in the event that this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2016.438s">an</a> anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2017.899s">And</a> then second bullet, Medford public schools will complete required bullying forms and collect missing information and signatures when a report of bullying was made that did not use approved forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2029.385s">So</a> what the spirit of what I tried to lay out here based on all the conversations we've had is that <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2037.062s">a</a> report is like in the queue when it meets a certain amount of criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2042.583s">And</a> that we can and should encourage parents to use the form because I think it provides guidance to like that sort of completeness. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2051.385s">But</a> that if that doesn't happen, then it is the responsibility of the school district, the investigator, whoever that is, to do the paperwork on the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2062.627s">So</a> what I'm trying to do is be crystal clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2067.148s">what</a> starts the clock for parents in particular and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2072.671s">I</a> think we should definitely encourage the use of the form wherever we can, but also sort of recognizing like we do need consistent documentation around these things, which is why the second bullet of like whoever is doing this investigation will complete the paperwork if that hasn't already been done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2189.153s">We</a> do, a little bit later in the document, we talk about false reporting, false allegations.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2205.558s">Incident</a> reporting also, we also sort of frame up that staff are required to report incidents that they witness or become aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2216.71s">that</a> staff follow the same reporting responsibilities as students and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2221.312s">And</a> that Medford will accept and investigate allegations of bullying or retaliation that are made anonymously. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2227.795s">However,</a> no disciplinary action shall be taken against the students solely on the basis of an anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2232.577s">And</a> that's like, right, that anonymous language was right out of the law.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2346.42s">Okay,</a> let's move on to investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2351.135s">Medford</a> Public Schools will promptly investigate all reports of bullying impacted parties and caregivers will be notified within two business days of receipt of such a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2359.818s">We</a> have talked about timeframes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2361.598s">I</a> think this is what we have talked about, but open to some discussion there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2367.48s">Remain</a> impartial through the course of any investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2369.781s">In</a> the event of a conflict of interest, the investigator must disclose the conflict to their immediate supervisor within 24 hours of the receipt of the bullying report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2377.745s">Conflict</a> of interest may include family relationships and or supervisor-supervisee relationships among other possible conflicts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2385.272s">Take</a> immediate and necessary action to ensure student safety while any investigation proceeds and will take care to reassure those who report incidents that their involvement will remain confidential wherever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2395.622s">Document</a> interviews conducted with all relevant parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2398.725s">All</a> notes shall become part of the record of the incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2402.769s">maintain</a> a central student information system to store incident investigation forms, determinations, and disciplinary action, remediation, target safety actions taken alphabetically by aggressor for their graduation date. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2418.684s">That</a> came out of the last policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2422.419s">And</a> then discipline information is also came out of last policy, whether written or electronic is part of the temporary record and be kept for six years after the graduation of involved students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2432.546s">Temporary</a> records must be destroyed no later than seven years after graduation of involved students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2436.709s">That</a> came straight out of the prior policy from a record retention perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2441.372s">Ensure</a> copies of all bullying investigation forms, reporting forms, if any remediation agreements and behavior plans <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2450.11s">are</a> placed in the student file. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2453.972s">This</a> last bullet I would like to discuss because it came out of the prior policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2459.475s">It</a> says, and I did not update, I did not change this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2462.857s">Your</a> personal notes can be kept indefinitely as long as you don't share or consult with them in the presence of parents or students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2471.401s">And</a> that felt super alarming to me, but I didn't know if there was something I didn't know, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2479.403s">wanted</a> to specifically point that out and recommend that we strike it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2546.752s">I</a> couldn't think of any legitimate reason to keep personal notes like this, but I don't work in a school, so I didn't wanna just delete it, but it felt like really, really concerning to me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2681.468s">And</a> we can check with Attorney Greenspan as well about whether there's some, I didn't read anything like that when I reread the law top to bottom, but I am not a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2693.715s">I</a> will defer to him so we can ask him that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2698.037s">The</a> next section is on decisions and findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2700.198s">So</a> this is one of the references that was added from our special ed attorneys so that we will act in accordance with Master in Law Chapter 71B, Section 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2715.465s">around</a> when the IEP team determines a student has a disability that affects social skills development or the student may participate in or is vulnerable to bullying, harassment, teasing because of his or her disability, the team will consider what should be included in the IEP to develop the student's skills and proficiencies to avoid and respond to bullying, harassment, or teasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2737.17s">So</a> that is in there to say that we know and we understand that there are potential impacts there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2746.95s">Also</a> under decisions and findings, this, so what I did was I put two structures in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2754.658s">One</a> is complete the following steps if the investigator determines that bullying or retaliation has occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2762.446s">And</a> so there's like notifying the police or if the principal believes there are criminal charges that may be pursued. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2770.736s">take</a> appropriate disciplinary action consistent with the policies and procedures of Medford Public Schools, notify parents, notify them of any action taken to prevent further acts of bullying and provide victims and aggressors with significant opportunities for counseling services. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2789.808s">This</a> can take the form, this is like right out of the prior policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2793.722s">I</a> then put in a structure here that says like if if bullying if the investigator determines that bullying has not net has not occurred, but that the incident warrants action to to avoid progression of the relationship to one where bullying does occur so this is the conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2811.615s">component</a> that there are a set of steps here as well in terms of, you know, any disciplinary action, notifying parents, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2820.2s">So</a> it's largely the same except for the part where we're going to notify the police in some instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2826.884s">One</a> thing I think we heard from parents as we have talked about this is, I think there's a belief that if bullying is not the end finding, and I think we had a related conversation about appeals last time, that means nothing is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2843.538s">And</a> I think that's actually not true at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2846.6s">If</a> there is conflict, there still is a requirement on behalf of the district to act <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2852.965s">to</a> prevent this conflict from escalating to a repeated pattern of bullying, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2858.489s">So</a> what I tried to do was sort of lay this out so that there were clear responsibilities of the district, whether bullying has occurred by the determination of the investigator or whether conflict has occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2872.36s">And</a> so that's the structure here that I tried to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2877.278s">And</a> then act to create a stable environment for victims and aggressors, regardless of whether bullying or conflict has occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2884.059s">Interventions</a> may include, this table was in the prior policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2889.54s">I</a> think it's helpful for people to understand that these things could be the kinds of things that happen in both cases, bullying or conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2900.922s">And</a> then there's a bullet here that, you know, when we're talking about findings, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2908.638s">Discipline</a> any student who knowingly makes a false accusation of bullying or retaliation per the approved disciplinary policies of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2918.242s">If</a> the false allegations have civil and or criminal elements, further actions may be referred to by the appropriate law enforcement agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2929.146s">This</a> set of references and links <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2935.992s">is</a> was provided by our special ed attorneys, I think we also have some links to our policies that will need to be added in here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2956.3s">We</a> probably need to just reframe this a little bit, so this is not just simply about false accusations, although that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2965.292s">but</a> also that discipline could be the consequence of an investigation, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=2980.761s">So</a> we'll just clarify that, that discipline is a potential outcome here, whether it is a consequence of the investigation, whether it's bullying, whether it's conflict, whether it's a false accusation, whether it's retaliation, discipline is a possible outcome and that the district will administer consequences that are consistent with discipline under the law and consistent with our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3002.471s">So</a> I think we have a couple of other links that we'll need to go in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3008.898s">And</a> the only other thing that we talked a little bit about, you know, false reporting, there was a, there was reference to like what happens in a situation where there's false reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3022.409s">And</a> when I thought about like the involvement of like parents, caregivers, community members, et cetera, who might be involved in false reporting, it struck me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3031.657s">And</a> I, again, I'd be interested in how this works in practice that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3036.821s">there's</a> nothing you can do to somebody who falsely reports something to you that doesn't, you know, that is not a student in your building or a staff member, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3045.008s">So</a> if a person in the community provides a false report, like there's not any recourse the district particularly has against that person because of this false, you know, this false report, but that I wanted to make sure that there was a reference that those kinds of things might be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3065.265s">And</a> to know that that's going to be really situational, like what you all decide to do about it, but that there is accountability for that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3073.247s">It</a> just is not accountability that the school district has. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3075.748s">So</a> your responsibility would be to get it to the person who can actually take action if necessary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3088.619s">Retaliation,</a> so Medford Public Schools will discipline any student who knowingly retaliates against another student as a result of a bullying allegation or investigation per the approved disciplinary policies outlined by Medford Public School Committee and as further described in school handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3104.191s">If</a> the retaliation acts have civil and or criminal elements, same language came out of the last policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3113.098s">Some</a> other, any questions so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3115.499s">I'm</a> just trying to keep an eye on time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3119.452s">I</a> think we're doing okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3121.693s">The</a> responsibilities that are in addition to what we've described. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3127.576s">So</a> there are some central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3131.416s">Responsibilities</a> here around reporting to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3136.159s">There's</a> a survey that must be administered every four years under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3140.381s">There's</a> outreach required. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3141.682s">So</a> there's some central administration responsibilities here that are outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3147.245s">Building</a> leaders really was just to say a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3153.008s">that</a> our building leaders will take proactive steps to avoid escalation of incidents into bullying behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3159.551s">They'll</a> document incidents of student behavior and treat these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures, and that our building leaders will amend handbooks to reflect policy and plans herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3170.236s">And</a> then the school committee's responsibility, and again, this is sort of additive to everything else that we've talked about, is that this plan needs to be updated biannually according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3182.471s">We're</a> almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3183.474s">The</a> last section is a procedure for what happens to receive and investigate a bullying report. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3194.377s">I</a> did my best to not change the process that was outlined, but the process that was outlined was admittedly a little bit like helter skelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3203.822s">So</a> I think I put it all together the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3206.763s">I</a> would definitely want you all to like review that and make sure that you're in agreement, but this is a step like from the top to the bottom that we would be expecting to follow because the law does say that this policy needs to include procedural steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3224.272s">which</a> is unlike most policies, but that is what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3228.075s">So</a> this is, you know, a series of steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3233.078s">I</a> think there's like 15 steps that go from, you know, the very top of like receiving a report to all the way down so that there's just one place that you could go and look at that, particularly if you're a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3247.528s">The</a> one comment that I had in here, and Joan, I want to point this out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3253.051s">This</a> component of if the student has an IEP or 504, work with his or her liaison to determine whether the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability throughout the remainder of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3264.116s">That</a> language was in the process in the prior document, but it was much, much, much, much, much, much further down in the sequence of steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3272.882s">And</a> it struck me that it should be happening at the top of the funnel and not like many, many steps into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3280.307s">So</a> I would ask that maybe when we turn this over to you all for your review, that you just take a look at that and make sure you agree that that's in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3296.524s">And</a> then last couple sections here, support for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3301.247s">These</a> are some of the links that member McLaughlin talked about in terms of additional information from DESE and regarding discipline for students with disabilities and this problem resolution system, that's all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3316.637s">There</a> are a handful of other definitions here that are relevant to the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3324.975s">And</a> then the final thing that I wanted to talk a little bit about with AllView is, I was sort of of the opinion, all of these forms are important, but sort of seem like they didn't really belong in the bed of this document, but instead they belonged as their own discrete documents, so that a reporting form can be made available on the website and we could put it in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3351.658s">document</a> as an option for people to report and that those the incident investigation forms obviously don't necessarily need to be on the website, but they need to be available for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3360.981s">So</a> it felt clunky and cumbersome for those to be here, especially if we're going back to the premise that a bullying report does not need to come in on any particular form. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3372.525s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3373.465s">I</a> would recommend that we take these out and house them separately and that they become really the responsibility of the superintendent as would sort of any operational items in a typical policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3388.075s">So</a> that's my thought about what to do with these forms at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3392.799s">I</a> read the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3393.639s">I</a> thought they were generally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3396.601s">My</a> bigger issue with the forms was again just <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3400.005s">making</a> sure that it's clear that we don't have to wait for a form to consider that we have received a report.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3757.504s">I</a> also just wanted to say that the document prior was 34, 35 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3765.851s">And</a> I just wanted to point out, because I love when we can accomplish this, <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3772.627s">We'll</a> be like clear, concise, said and done in 13 pages instead of 34. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3779.432s">That's</a> a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3782.374s">From</a> a readability perspective, from a translation perspective, all of those things, I think this gets better when it is much more simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3794.833s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3798.535s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KThO1KlN-bc&t=3800.016s">I</a> was hoping to be under 10, but I didn't, we didn't make it.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=127.24s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=130.087s">All</a> present, and member Rousseau is also on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=133.65s">So</a> all present, six, seven, present, zero, absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=138.493s">Before</a> we get started, just a procedural question. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=141.095s">Dr.</a> Edward-Vincent, do you want us to hold all of our questions until the end, or do you want us to ask questions as we go along?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=1970.74s">If</a> I may, from the chair, can I just ask a question that is related? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=1974.904s">So</a> in the recommended investments, we're saying there'll be two literacy coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=1979.928s">And</a> then I also saw in the ESSER expenditures, additional support from Hill for literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=1988.915s">Is</a> the support from Hill intended to supplement the two coaches that are being recommended?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2309.125s">Are</a> there other questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2312.793s">member</a> Katz.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2667.775s">So</a> if I might just clarify what I think I heard you just say. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2673.587s">Starting</a> next year, the elementary students will no longer have a 1.30 early release.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2679.832s">On</a> Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2681.033s">And</a> in doing that, it created a situation where there needed to be an addition of instruction of some kind to the elementary schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2690.18s">And</a> the decision that you all have made strategically is that the right way to add another block of instruction is to take our paras who don't instruct today <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2702.324s">and</a> convert that position so that they are librarians who can both supervise children independently and instruct. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2710.668s">And</a> so it would be like essentially additive to the literacy curriculum with an eye toward like that future that you described of integrating media, tech, all of that stuff, which I think you see in other elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2726.475s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2727.696s">Like</a> that is the connection?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2730.177s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2973.412s">On</a> that topic of revolving accounts, I think we've we've talked about this several times, and I know that there's a. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2979.864s">heavy</a> connection between our ability to like report on revolving accounts and how the fiscal year ends and how the books get closed, not only for schools, but for the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=2989.692s">So</a> I wonder if you could think about a time when it would be appropriate for us to do a deep dive into the revolving accounts based on, based on all of those moving parts, which I know are not entirely in your control and let us know when you might be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3007.659s">do</a> a presentation dedicated to the revolving accounts, particularly because I know there's just a lot of there's a lot that goes in and out of those accounts and it is constantly changing, but also. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3017.985s">I</a> know that this the city's finance team has to work with you to provide some of that information, so I want to make sure there's enough time to do that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3028.528s">Because</a> we haven't had that kind of transparency in the past, but perhaps you can just think about what that timeline would be of when we could get a report like that, even in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3036.757s">I</a> don't think it, I don't personally think it has to be right now, but I think if we could establish a process where that happens regularly, that would be ideal.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3066.105s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3068.773s">The</a> other question that I had, I think, related to the federal grants in particular, when do we typically get notified of our allocations for all of those federal grants? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3077.926s">Is</a> it in line with how we are notified about state funding or is the timeline different?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3113.151s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3115.013s">Are</a> there other questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3125.684s">The</a> only other question that I had was about next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3128.427s">So</a> if I go back to slide four, at our next meeting on June 5th, <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3136.295s">the</a> school committee will take a vote to make its request to the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3145.141s">Is</a> that also the meeting where we will hold our officially and legally mandated public hearing for the public to come and weigh in on the budget as it has been described?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3191.135s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3191.575s">And</a> then the other sort of next step, I think, from our perspective is that we also will have to determine how to spend the municipal appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3205.581s">And</a> so I think in the last meeting, we talked about some recommendations from all of you about what it would take to close the gap between <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3215.185s">what</a> is 71, 835, 165 and the municipal allocation, which I believe stands at $71 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3223.991s">So</a> at some point on June 5th, do we also plan to have a discussion about closing that gap and what your thoughts are on how we might do that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3241.5s">I</a> think that's the question is when would we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3244.181s">I</a> know we have TBDs on here, but we do only have two more meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3249.682s">So</a> I just wanted us to think through and make sure that the committee can weigh in on that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3265.305s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3266.266s">And</a> then by our by our last meeting in June, which I believe is the 12th, I think we would ideally be able to adopt a budget number that meets the city's appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3280.557s">I</a> know the city budget is not out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3282.058s">I</a> believe that's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3284.2s">in</a> the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3285.361s">And</a> so the city council's budget process will start at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3290.425s">And</a> I know we try our best to line up to that, but I just want to be mindful that we will likely have to take two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3298.653s">One</a> to request the 71-8, assuming the committee doesn't have any significant changes to that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3306.147s">next</a> week, and then finally on how to adopt the city's allocation, whatever that may be when the Council ultimately approves a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3319.222s">And</a> I know their process is just getting going. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3322.525s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3325.689s">Are</a> there any other questions about the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3336.872s">Mayor,</a> did you want to speak?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3416.195s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3417.075s">If</a> there are no other questions, I will wait for a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/b258VJa79F4&t=3422.097s">Sorry,</a> if there are no other questions, I will ask for a motion to adjourn.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=362.217s">I</a> was just going to suggest that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=364.723s">As</a> a committee, we should probably just revisit the policy and make sure that we still agree that it's the right policy for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=371.445s">Any</a> delegation of that to the administration predates more than likely every person here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=376.947s">So</a> I don't think we can assume we know what their intentions were or what the dynamics were, but I do think our students always have really valuable things to say, and I don't wanna like interrupt what is happening <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=392.699s">already,</a> but I don't think that necessarily is the same as a collaboration with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=397.361s">So</a> I think, you know, at some point we should put a resolution on to have the rules committee, take a look at that policy and figure out like, what do we recommend going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=404.803s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=406.304s">Member</a> Ruseau.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4633.496s">I</a> think one of the things that came out in your report was this idea that the assistant principals are overburdened in their caseload, and you go on to recommend some strategies to provide additional staff to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4655.642s">You</a> also recommend an associate principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4658.384s">And</a> I think within your report, you say that there's approximately three to 500 students for an administrator and that our assistant principals have 400 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4670.891s">And</a> so I'm just, I'm trying to piece it all together because when I got to page 54, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4683.631s">M55,</a> where you talked about some of the duties of a potential position for an associate principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4689.995s">I</a> just was left wondering, what does the principal even do if all these other people are doing all these other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4696.239s">And</a> we have a pile of department directors who I think really, at least in my mind, are responsible for some amount of instructional leadership within their own departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4707.846s">Like</a> what does the org chart look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4712.276s">in</a> its totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4714.177s">And</a> I don't disagree per se with any independent thing that you suggested we explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4721.719s">But</a> I think what I'm really looking for is a cohesive picture of what a successful Medford high school slash Medford public schools might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4731.281s">And</a> that has to include all of the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4734.122s">It</a> has to include all of the assistant principals and what their responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4738.323s">And</a> we'll talk about job descriptions later and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4742.578s">it's</a> not my sense there aren't enough adults in the building to do the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4747.519s">And</a> maybe I'm completely wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4750.34s">And</a> it just didn't jump off the page at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4752.46s">Like</a> what is the reconciliation of what all the things that you're recommending and how the total delivery of duties would parse out? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4762.382s">Or</a> is there something else that is contributing to their workload that doesn't come across in those like caseload numbers?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4880.615s">Yeah,</a> and I can totally understand that because it's, I guess my thought is if you look at the role of the department heads, they're instructional leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4890.322s">And</a> so by extension, the role of the assistant principal is much more narrow as an instructional leader so that they have time to adequately be the disciplinarians in the building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4903.17s">So</a> I don't, I wouldn't expect anybody to go to their department head when they have a classroom management issue or a student issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4911.173s">But</a> like the folks that are responsible for those things, I think, should have increased capacity if they're not carrying an instructional leadership role at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4921.797s">And</a> that's like the bigger picture that I think we need to be clear about in what the responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4929.68s">And</a> like I said, I was left reading after I read, I was like, well, what is the principal even do at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4934.301s">And</a> I'm not to suggest we don't need a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4936.182s">We</a> absolutely need a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4937.723s">But</a> if we need a principal and we need an associate principal and we need an executive director at the Vogue and we need assistant principal at the Vogue and we need three assistant principals at the high school and we need deans of students in a part-time capacity to support them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4953.614s">Like,</a> is that a typical amount of people administering essentially <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4962.028s">like</a> discipline and overall school management for building of our size, it seemed like that's the question that's unanswered.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5136.099s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5138.08s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5139.631s">On</a> the topic of referrals, I think the other thing that struck me was frankly how unmanageable this list of potential referral reasons is like there's like 17 different ways to call somebody cut in class and 17 is an exaggeration, but there were many and. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5157.981s">It</a> just, it's way too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5160.844s">So</a> I think that makes everybody's job harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5164.907s">But</a> I was really struck by the fact that in, you know, in your 32 day period, 27% of teachers submitted no referrals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5177.556s">27%</a> of teachers submitted one to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5180.839s">Over</a> the like zero to nine referrals submitted in 30 days, that's 80% of our teaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5186.761s">So,</a> and I guess my question in that group is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5191.028s">are</a> they not submitting it because they gave up, or are they not submitting and they're just not doing it, which I have heard repeatedly, and it is so frustrating and something that needs to be addressed, or are they not doing it because they don't have these issues in their classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5208.621s">Like</a> I can't parse that from this information, and I suspect you'd have to go back and talk to people, but I don't know if you had an overall like sense of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5219.917s">Where</a> does that like fall line sort of draw?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5313.906s">Yeah,</a> and I have heard that, you know, from a whole variety of sources, and I hope that we can move to a place where not liking a class or a teacher is not a thing our kids have to experience in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5332.452s">But,</a> you know, I guess the other thing that I'll say as I read this and really your entire report is that the failures that we're experiencing are all <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5343.755s">implementation</a> failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5345.196s">They're</a> all failures of implementation, the dress code, the house model, student discipline, the referral model being wildly complex, returning to school post COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5354.9s">I</a> can't tell you how many times I've heard people say the school committee wouldn't let us discipline students on the return to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5362.823s">And</a> we've had a lot of hours of meetings and I don't ever, I really, truly don't ever remember that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5371.184s">And</a> certainly there is nothing in writing to substantiate that, that I was able to find because I did a little bit of digging, but even, you know, emergency preparedness, all these things, something is missing in terms of how directives get implemented or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5391.43s">And</a> it is the central thing that has to change at the high school in order to move the high school past where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5399.792s">The</a> dress code, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5401.004s">was</a> not unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5402.605s">The</a> dress code was quite clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5405.046s">Everybody</a> was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5408.988s">Many,</a> many meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5410.328s">We</a> talked extensively about hats and hoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5413.59s">That</a> there's any confusion is absolutely mind blowing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5418.572s">And</a> so the only answer there is that the implementation failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5424.014s">That</a> there's this confusion that the handbook says something that is in conflict with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5427.956s">Like,</a> these are the kinds of things that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5430.543s">You</a> know they, I think they seem small at the time but they're really, really important when you want to sort of move six or eight or 12 months down the road from a change and say did it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5444.671s">The</a> answer will always be no if you don't take the time to implement without exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5452.217s">And</a> the last thing I'll say is I actually enjoyed the picture of your model and the consequence of lacking various components. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5461.444s">And</a> I think if you use that model and you look at any of the challenges we have, you can really clearly point out what was missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5473.573s">It</a> is not a surprise that we're struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5475.595s">So</a> I do thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5478.877s">And</a> I am, I just finished serving on the principal selection committee and I'm really hopeful about our candidates for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5487.745s">And</a> I'm entirely on board with making sure that that incoming principal has the resources that they need to really make a difference here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5498.093s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7760.816s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7762.62s">As</a> I was referencing earlier, this has come up multiple times in the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7767.902s">Certainly,</a> as we were talking about the roles and responsibilities of the high school principal for which we are interviewing, it came up, we were asked questions by candidates and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7780.486s">But</a> we did, several years ago, try to establish a process that would make sure that we are thoughtfully looking at these positions on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7792.167s">So</a> my request really is not that there's an answer tonight, but that before the year is out, we do have a plan for actually reviewing these job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7801.975s">I</a> think it's incredibly hard to figure out and not clear to me, you know, who does the, does the director of such and such a topic have responsibilities for supervision? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7816.001s">Do</a> they have responsibilities for duties? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7819.524s">All</a> of that is very muddy and it's not easy to even know where to go to look for those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7823.387s">So</a> my request is just that at some point we get back to this thing we originally unanimously supported and make sure that we're on a better path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7837.237s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7901.471s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7903.232s">I</a> know there has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes in our food service area as a result of an audit and other changes that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7912.416s">So</a> I thought it would be a good time to remind everybody that we were interested in pursuing <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7919.933s">some</a> more information about composting based on the report that the Global Scholars presented last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7926.058s">I've</a> been asked about it by my daughter, who was one of the presenters several times, and I keep telling her, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7931.101s">So</a> I wanted to put that back on everybody's radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7934.824s">And</a> again, just, you know, if there are things happening in the district that we're unaware of, I think people would be happy to hear about those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7942.73s">But</a> I think also, you know, what is our plan for next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7945.712s">And</a> is composting part of the food service plan, I think is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7949.318s">So</a> it doesn't have to be today, but as we talk about food service.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8005.589s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8005.989s">So</a> just looking for an update at some point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8075.394s">I</a> think we talked about this when we had a presentation for the website that there's potentially some connections to some of the school committee's goals around accessibility and translation that probably just warrant a little bit of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8092.3s">I</a> think on our part about what the website's capabilities are and really talk about what those next phases might look like for phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8101.004s">So</a> just officially asking the committee to push this to committee so that we can work on it.<h2><a href="../2023-04-28_UlyUXBbkOUM/2023-04-28_UlyUXBbkOUM.html">MSC - Evaluation Subcommittee Meeting - 4.27.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=596.902s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=597.002s">I</a> don't have any comments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=599.063s">Yeah,</a> I got and reviewed the instructions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=602.405s">So</a> yeah, I did get them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=675.383s">I</a> thought it looked great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=676.183s">I</a> don't have any questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1300.708s">I</a> think we should take the approach of, for each of the, whatever it is, like three or four things, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1309.557s">you</a> know, representative comments include. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1312.059s">And</a> then just a couple of bullets where we're taking like verbatim what various members said, because we're going to send everybody, everybody's like detailed comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1323.026s">And</a> I think if we did that, we would have an opportunity to like, you know, truly like pick like the gamut of feedback without saying the same thing three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1337.316s">So</a> if three people say, <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1339.703s">I</a> really like that the superintendent did this very specific thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1343.306s">We</a> just put that once and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1346.228s">But</a> I think maybe a little bit of culling that we would do, but otherwise, I would frame it as comments from the committee include and just leave that like that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1363.961s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1366.623s">That</a> is how I would frame the narrative.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1385.118s">It</a> only happens in full committee meetings.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1447.309s">I</a> think that's the value of, of not trying to create something completely independent of <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1458.577s">What</a> the comments are, because then you can say, you know, these are representative comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1464.56s">And,</a> you know, maybe each of us can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1466.161s">1,</a> 1 or 2 or whatever, and, you know, when we have a meeting schedule, so we can each take 1 or 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1474.526s">Do</a> what we think is the consolidation and then we have something to review.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1531.774s">Well,</a> I would say select representative comments for the final evaluation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UlyUXBbkOUM&t=1618.348s">I</a> would put it right there.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=944.934s">Howard,</a> are you saying that under the law, an allegation cannot be brought against anybody but a student or a staff member?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1648.862s">Um,</a> Howard is your point that the law requires us to do this every two years and we are saying we are going to do it every one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1657.486s">And</a> is that really a decision that we need to make?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1663.268s">I</a> think that's the question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1786.414s">Because</a> I think we do want <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1789.0s">there</a> to be an expectation that schools are documenting instances of unacceptable behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1793.343s">I</a> think the two variables there is all is a really aggressive word to use when you talk about documenting things that happen in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1802.969s">And</a> then I think the other squishy word there is unacceptable because that means very different things to very different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1811.353s">Um,</a> but I think if you take out all, I could live with the gray area and the judgment required to say, is this like infraction, like something to document yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1828.085s">Um,</a> and to leave that in the hands of the, of the buildings, but to set the expectation that we do expect documentation from schools to be happening on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1841.604s">because</a> I think that part is important, that that expectation is clearly coming from the school committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1911.437s">But</a> I would consider that out of the scope for this policy, because there are other policies and procedures that govern all of those things that are separate and distinct from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1926.19s">policy.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2048.043s">I</a> would be fine with removing unacceptable, but I am absolutely against duplicating information across multiple policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2057.463s">a</a> disastrous nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2058.604s">I</a> think if we want to put a link that references, um, standard disciplinary procedures, uh, for students with and without disabilities, I think that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2069.049s">As</a> long as it's a link that sends somebody somewhere relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2072.671s">Um,</a> but I am not in favor of replicating information into this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2076.373s">It</a> just, it will make it unmanageable and unwieldy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2079.835s">And</a> I don't think we, uh, as a district have a track record of <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2085.57s">maintenance</a> of our policies and procedures, and we're just making it worse by duplicating information.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2423.534s">I</a> appreciate that this is incredibly painful and I wish that lots and lots of people before the people on this call had taken seriously this work in a way that would have made this easier, but we are here and we have to do this work and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2438.798s">tedious</a> and painful, and I think we're making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2442.04s">So,</a> um, I just want us to stay focused on that and to button it up at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2446.842s">Um,</a> in the last meeting, I volunteered that once we had clarity from our attorney about what these, um, things were that we could or could not do, um, that I would then go through and take a cut at trying to make this digestible for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2462.831s">That's</a> not work I can do until we get through these comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2466.143s">I'm</a> still happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2467.285s">I'm</a> happy to do that after this meeting, but it is not work that is productive until we have clarity from the attorney, which is I think the whole point of this meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2501.492s">Can</a> you just provide me those links member McLaughlin, and I'll just wrap them into the next version.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2525.146s">Yeah,</a> and then I can strap it in.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2673.972s">It</a> certainly looks very- I mean, this particular section is about startup, isn't it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2681.098s">So</a> is that required, Howard?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2692.927s">you</a> know, the role of parents, but not in how it was started.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2701.104s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2701.425s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2701.785s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2963.075s">If</a> we have a separate policy, we should review that policy and make sure it is updated as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3902.683s">Howard,</a> are you saying the law does not require an appeals process or are you saying the law prohibits an appeals process?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3938.353s">I</a> mean, most of these issues are all being arbitrated by the principal, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3943.817s">Or</a> the assistant principal in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3947.2s">I</a> have heard from countless parents who have just vehemently disagreed with the process <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3956.496s">that</a> they have gone through as they have filed bullying complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3960.998s">And</a> I have huge hesitation to say that like, there is no process beyond what the principal like may find or not find to be having a continuing conversation with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3977.606s">Like</a> I know she is the, she is the like appeals officer in all kinds of places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3982.529s">I</a> am wildly uncomfortable that <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3985.433s">we're</a> gonna take something as serious as bullying and say there's no appeals process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3989.595s">Because</a> I have just heard, I have heard so many stories that just give me huge pause at the consistency and the efficacy of the decision-making happening over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4002.683s">And</a> I think there needs to be a pathway that rises to the level of the superintendent.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4066.729s">The</a> stories that I hear are repeated, consistent, persistent issues where still no bullying finding has been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4077.875s">That's</a> obviously a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4082.558s">That</a> is our reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4084.059s">We</a> have students unenrolling from the district because of the <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4087.854s">because</a> of how their bullying incidents were handled or not handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4092.617s">Again,</a> in the eyes of the parent, I understand there's a lot of moving parts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4095.638s">I</a> totally get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4098.56s">I'm</a> just saying like with all of those moving parts, I would like to see there be some sort of centralized accountability path that gives us a feeling of reassurance and consistency that we can't have <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4118.335s">seven</a> plus people being like the kings of their kingdoms and interpreting this policy any which way that they might. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4129.222s">I</a> think there has to be some pathway that drives to consistency on this decision-making.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4219.928s">Uh,</a> no, that's just something that I think is still very much an open item for me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4446.236s">So</a> I just want to- I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4448.498s">The</a> situations that I'm referring to, to my knowledge, have nothing to do with students on IEPs or special needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4455.296s">They</a> are situations where based on all these references we're putting in about the rights of students that are very important for students with IEPs, there are at least as many students who don't have any of those rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4468.979s">And</a> they deserve a pathway just like everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4478.401s">All</a> of our students who are going through this process deserve a pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4484.888s">I</a> understand that we have to comply with the law, but this is the school committee's policy, which has to comply with the law, but it does not have to be narrowly defined by the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4495.997s">So</a> I do, I am of the opinion that we do have the authority to say that there needs to be a pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4504.064s">And</a> if we're saying you can call the superintendent anytime about these things, that is essentially <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4511.503s">an</a> appeal pathway, and all we're saying is we should make it clear to parents that they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4517.624s">It</a> could be as simple as if you disagree with these findings, please email the superintendent and set up time to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4524.346s">It</a> could be as simple as that, but parents who are left in these situations do need to know what their pathway is, and in both cases particularly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4538.731s">For</a> those students who don't have additional rights because they don't have an IEP, they need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4543.114s">And</a> for students who have additional rights because they have IEPs, they need to know too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4548.017s">That</a> is, to me, it's our job to set policy that does protect all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4553.601s">And</a> I do, I feel very strongly that consistency, accountability, and supervision of this stuff is not something that we can do on the school committee, but what we can do is outline what we think is effective from a policy perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=5102.595s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=5104.9s">The</a> committee wants me to go through this version that you're going to send and presented cleaned up document at the next meeting.<h2><a href="../2023-04-10_2knYezaLYwg/2023-04-10_2knYezaLYwg.html">4.10.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=2904.479s">I</a> was referring to the literacy curriculum and the Hill for literacy numbers on that slide.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3703.17s">But</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3705.651s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3705.972s">Like,</a> no, if we have to pay one penny over what we're paying today, then that is not, that is not in the 74 million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3712.155s">Not</a> yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3726.956s">I</a> think every time we bring in folks at various levels, the people who have been at the district for 20 years or 15 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3737.315s">look</a> at the increased salary that we're paying to somebody who just walked in the door and say, what about me? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3745.642s">So</a> there's a set of dominoes that happens and especially it is absolutely present right now in the marketplace because people are unwilling to work for the rates that they once were. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3758.613s">And</a> so we have a really thin labor pool, we have a lot of market pressure and I think we have to be prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3767.766s">new</a> high school principals are making at least $40,000 more than our high school principal makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3773.89s">So</a> that's just a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3776.952s">And</a> if we want a high school principal, we're going to have to contend with that fact in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3782.716s">And</a> then that creates a whole set of considerations that we need to be planning for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3792.625s">I</a> will admit, I am finding it really hard to process what we're saying is our recommendation versus what we're saying is our doomsday scissors approach to get to the number that we are likely to receive from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3808.477s">And</a> I would like us to think about how to make it clear, like what do we believe that we need to run the district next year <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3819.267s">it's</a> okay if that means like we don't need subscriptions but subscriptions is like not even close to remotely covering the gap that we're talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3826.513s">So,</a> I would like on May 1st for the presentation to exclusively be about what is our recommendation because it's our job to advocate in front of the city and the mayor to tell the community what we need for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3841.845s">If</a> we don't do that, nobody will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3844.507s">So,</a> I think it's really incumbent on us to lay that out thoughtfully so that <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3848.979s">when</a> we look at that list and we say, yes, this is the number, we know that it means pre-literacy coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3856.324s">We</a> know that it means one theater teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3858.585s">We</a> know that it means two FTEs for OT and speech therapy, like that we know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3865.17s">So</a> then when we have to start crossing things off the list, it's really clear like where we started and what hard decisions we had to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3874.929s">Those</a> hard decisions, 90% of our costs are people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3877.291s">So</a> those hard decisions are about positions by and large. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3882.015s">So</a> I think on May 1st, we really need to have a crystal clear presentation that says, here's the dollar amount for our contractual obligations only. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3893.745s">Here</a> are the additions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3895.366s">Here's</a> what they each cost so that we really are clear what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3901.01s">And</a> then we can get to work on the hard decisions, which <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3905.07s">have</a> to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3905.95s">However,</a> like we still don't know what the what the consolidated house and senate budget will be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3914.873s">We</a> have the governor's proposal but we don't have house and we don't have the joint ways and means budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3920.756s">Um</a> what we do know is that the the state has given us a few million dollars and not all of that is slated to come via that 71 million dollars that we're anticipating being allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3933.52s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3934.389s">I</a> like to think that there's an opportunity for us to make a case there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3938.592s">And</a> the city is sitting on $25 million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3941.114s">I'd</a> like to think there's an opportunity to demonstrate to the community that there is a very good reason to dip into the giant pile of free cash to get us through what is another lean year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3953.302s">This</a> is my fourth year, my fourth budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3955.764s">It's</a> the third one that's bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3959.398s">There's</a> a lot to talk about there, and we can talk about that at some point in time, but I think we can't do that unless we're clear on what it is that we thought we needed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=3968.846s">And</a> I think what's happening right now is all of that stuff is getting mushed together, and I think it's really hard to understand what we're trying to accomplish by doing that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4200.342s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4201.862s">Member</a> Grimm and then Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4204.103s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4207.824s">On</a> the budget priorities list, you do mention that we need four additional specialists for the elementary school, but it doesn't describe what they will do <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4220.888s">What</a> will they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4223.21s">Besides</a> fill a spot in the schedule.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4352.642s">If</a> I look at page 15 and 16, if I add up the columns about FY 24, I get to about $2,000,000 and $2,020,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4358.305s">And</a> it looks like we have 3.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4360.186s">So</a> does that mean that we only have anticipated ESSER spending <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4379.284s">with</a> still about 1.1 million to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4383.667s">I'm</a> just having a hard time making the math add up to 3.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4387.108s">I'm</a> not sure if it's supposed to, but I can't tell if something is missing or if it's just that we haven't decided how to use that remaining $1 million yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4440.703s">Yes,</a> that is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4446.108s">Well,</a> I'm calculating what we're planning to spend in FY24 to be 2.02 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4454.164s">And</a> we have $3.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4455.465s">So</a> I think that means there's still a million dollars untagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4459.686s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4507.63s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4509.091s">And</a> my last comment is a motion to, so I'd like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendation only include our request to the municipal government and that it refrain from talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4530.854s">the</a> hard decisions that come next.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4537.755s">That</a> the superintendent's recommendation, her presentation on May 1st will only contain our recommendation for the FY 24 budget or our request for the FY 24 budget and that it will not simultaneously seek to deal with <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4559.498s">decisions</a> that might need to be made after the fact.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4617.972s">So,</a> I am asking that the presentation on May 1st be purely our request to the municipal government for what we believe we need in FY24 to operate Medford Public Schools in a responsible manner.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4635.061s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4635.421s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4638.043s">The</a> school committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4829.552s">I</a> think my ask is that when the superintendent makes that recommendation to us, it is not muddied with hard decisions <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4838.018s">that</a> she has to work on in parallel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4840.7s">It's</a> totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4841.721s">I</a> recognize that that's the reality, but we can't do our jobs unless we hear from her what she thinks this district needs to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4850.467s">So</a> what we can't do on May 1st is get something that is like a mishmash of what I need and what I know I'm gonna get, because then we can't do our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4861.134s">So</a> I'm just asking that the superintendent's recommendation <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4864.639s">be</a> clear and distinct about what she is asking this city to provide on her behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4871.944s">Um</a> and then if we have things to add, things to change, that's what would happen, you know, after that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4879.79s">But</a> honestly, it by and large is going to be what she recommends. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4883.852s">I</a> mean that we think small things change year every year but there's we we can't make wholesale changes without the right data. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4892.239s">I</a> I'm just asking that we not muddy the water on May 1st with a bunch of stuff that has to come and maybe it comes on May 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4900.566s">I'm</a> totally fine with that but we need a basis that is clear and clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4907.411s">Point</a> of information there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4924.318s">I</a> mean, it doesn't contain any of the things on the needs slide, and it doesn't contain- You mean broken out? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4932.221s">Like</a> this slide, slide 18, none of these things are in $74 million, nor is the HECAT, nor is- I knew the HECAT was, but none of these things are? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4944.205s">None</a> of the priorities are? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4945.726s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4975.385s">I</a> don't think the superintendent is recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4977.085s">No,</a> I know, she's not recommending, she's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4979.666s">Is</a> that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4981.226s">That</a> is my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4982.146s">That's</a> why I think we need a clear picture of what the ask is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4987.688s">So</a> we can say, yes, we agree with the ask or no, you have to add this to the ask, or maybe like, I know you want this thing, but we have to take it out of the ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=4996.69s">Like</a> that is work we have to do, but we can't do it until we have just a clear picture of what that number, what those numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=5005.632s">And</a> there is no second on my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=5007.173s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=5574.919s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=5575.339s">I</a> agree that we need to hear about that next step really quickly in the follow on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=5581.621s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that the superintendent will present her plan to close the gap that we know will exist at our May 15th meeting.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3479.659s">Thanks,</a> Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3482.122s">Earlier</a> last year, we applied for a grant through the MSBA to <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3487.101s">take</a> a look at what needs to happen in Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3489.062s">And</a> when we were here last year, I talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3491.884s">We</a> were advised in December that we did not make the cut this year, but that things look good for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3500.008s">At</a> about the same time, I got a refund check from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3506.072s">And</a> I thought to myself, 10 schools could have been built with the refunds that went to taxpayers, 10 schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3515.781s">So</a> 10 communities like Medford are waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3520.044s">What</a> happens during that time? <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3521.906s">It's</a> going to cost us more to build that school next year than it would have this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3528.21s">So</a> if you are able, take that refund check and find a place in Medford that can benefit from the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3537.377s">That's</a> a small way to try to sort of level the playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3542.361s">But</a> we need to stop cutting checks when we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3545.667s">meet</a> our basic services and needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3547.669s">Our</a> kids deserve a functioning high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3550.171s">And</a> we're sort of on the brink of that building not being serviceable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3555.717s">And</a> we're going to go at it again with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3557.859s">I</a> hope the city council will unanimously support that on Tuesday, I think, is your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3565.152s">because</a> that support is very necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3567.554s">I</a> hope the MSBA will come to the table so that we can get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3572.277s">And</a> if they don't, I hope that the city will say we have to start anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3576.459s">So</a> that's an example of how this failure of government lands here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3583.763s">So</a> we need to be prepared to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3587.705s">if</a> the government continues to not be able to provide those services from the federal level, from the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3594.107s">Unfortunately,</a> it rests on the feet of the people in front of you, so thank you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3600.79s">We</a> really do need to think carefully about the impact of things like big tax refund checks, and what does that mean we didn't get? <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3608.412s">What</a> does that mean we didn't spend? <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3610.513s">Are</a> we okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3612.894s">I'm</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3614.374s">So</a> I hope we never cut another refund check. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=3616.95s">until</a> we can fix the MBTA, fix housing instability, fix the chronic aging issues that Pat was talking about, and fix public education.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4369.721s">The</a> MTA last year started a scholarship fund here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4373.922s">So</a> the MTA is the Medford Teachers Association, our teachers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4377.443s">They</a> started a scholarship program for our students, for students of color here in Medford interested in pursuing education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4385.306s">So</a> back to what you might want to do with those few pennies that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4390.027s">That's</a> another really worthy cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4391.447s">They're</a> set up, they're a 501c3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4394.654s">they</a> can employer match and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4396.616s">And</a> it's a tax deductible way to invest in students of color here in Medford who want to pursue education and hopefully come back and work for Medford Public Schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=4993.997s">like</a> 11 union contracts and they've all been out for renewal and there's been a lot of discussion about particularly the teachers contract, it's the biggest one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5004.205s">But</a> one of the really important things we did this year was dramatically increase the pay of our paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5010.79s">So</a> I won't say it <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5013.627s">It</a> impacted everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5015.149s">All</a> paraprofessionals received a significant increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5018.093s">Many</a> of our paraprofessionals, particularly those who work with our high-need students, saw a very significant increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5025.281s">Does</a> that mean it's perfect? <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5027.504s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5029.797s">Our</a> paraprofessionals were making an average of like $17,000 a year prior, a year, a year, 184 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5033.46s">And</a> now their average pay is over $25,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5035.722s">Up</a> to about $30,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5036.623s">So</a> it was a huge investment in our paraprofessional workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5056.157s">We</a> should have done it many years ago, so Ruth could have come to work for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5062.541s">But</a> it was a lot of hard work and shared commitment by everybody from the administration to the school committee to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=5074.629s">And</a> it's a really, really important first step into stabilizing that workforce for Medford Public Schools, but it is just the first step.<h2><a href="../2023-04-03_bPsPwj5vBSI/2023-04-03_bPsPwj5vBSI.html">MSC Budget Committee of the Whole - 4.3.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=538.561s">Member</a> Graham, do you want us to hold all our questions till the end or do you wanna take questions as you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=543.142s">Dr.</a> Vincent, totally up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=545.743s">You</a> wanna complete the slideshow and then questions after or?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=551.845s">No,</a> it's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=552.405s">I</a> don't care either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=553.145s">I</a> just wanted to know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2470.356s">Member</a> Graham, can you tell me what the total ESSER grant is? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2479.102s">What's</a> the complete ESSER number that we've been granted from the feds? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2490.07s">All</a> three combined, yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2507.152s">Okay,</a> and then I think what I would like to see somehow is a picture that says like, here's all the money that we have, whatever the number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2516.977s">I</a> think it's 7.2 or 6.7, something like that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2520.586s">And</a> then like, what did we spend in FY22? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2523.047s">What</a> did we spend in FY23? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2524.048s">What</a> do we plan to spend in FY24? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2527.089s">So</a> that we can see like, how did we get to the place where there's $3 million left in FY24? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2535.593s">Because</a> like, if I count up what's on the FY23 page, if there was a total on the page, it would be 2.7, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2545.278s">And</a> if there was a total on the FY22, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2548.749s">four</a> number, it would be 1.5, I think, based on what I tried to calculate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2556.658s">And</a> so I guess I'm just trying to understand like one of the things that we had to do last year was pay for things that were operating budget, clearly operating budget oriented with ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2567.09s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2569.728s">want</a> to know like where does that fit into the equation of like how we're ticking down our ESSER funds because we should spend all of it but more importantly if we have to make plans for that money to come back into the operating budget we need to know and I don't feel like I know what those what those things are that we have put in ESSER that are not one time that are recurring that either we're gonna have to make a choice about or find money to pay for <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2597.934s">So,</a> when I think about Essar like in my mind, there's a picture that shows how the money has been spent over time and where there are things that if we wish to continue them because it's reasonable to think that you would that we are going to have to find a way to pay for and that doesn't have to be this year but I think we need to know that this year so that we can think carefully about what else we spend this <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2626.432s">that</a> money is no longer available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2628.254s">And</a> I know it's just one year away, one year from now, we'll be having that conversation, but I want to make sure we know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2634.72s">But</a> I don't think that means, to Member Ruseau's point, that just because we have vacancies in a position that we don't need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2643.749s">So</a> I do echo his comments about wanting to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2648.186s">that</a> our initial budget request is actually the request that outlines what we need to promote teaching and learning in our district and not the doomsday scenario or the like contingency scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2663.769s">Like</a> I totally understand hard decisions and we will have to make them at some point in time, but I want the budget to be, what do the students need? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2672.262s">And</a> I don't think that means we cannot cut things right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2675.585s">I</a> think if there are things that we are paying for that students aren't using or that they don't need, we should be proactively demonstrating to the community that we care about that and we are looking for those ways to eliminate spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2689.475s">So</a> if there are subscriptions out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2692.17s">that</a> we're not paying for, for example, that we're paying for and the utilization is really low. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2696.037s">I</a> think the first question should be, why is the utilization low? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2699.003s">Like,</a> why did we use it in COVID and all of a sudden we don't need to use it anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2702.229s">Is</a> that <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2703.598s">because</a> we've reverted back to some older method of how we communicate information to kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2710.62s">And</a> is that what's right for kids or is that just what's comfortable in the classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2714.281s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2716.761s">But</a> if the answer really is like, this is not a resource that we need as a district, I think we should definitely in this phase of the budget, like remove those things because I want, I do want us to demonstrate to the community that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2731.041s">Like</a> we all know that there is no open checkbook right like so if there are things like that, where we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2738.889s">We</a> should be like reducing those things I want us to do that I don't want to play a game, where we say we need everything, and then we really can like cut things out like I just don't think that helps the Community or anybody in the process, so if there are things where. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2753.55s">We</a> have staff that legitimately we do not need to promote teaching and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2757.571s">We</a> should be like looking at reflecting that in our, in our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2761.792s">Like</a> we should not be waiting to do that until the very last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2764.893s">But</a> I, I, we have done a lot of work on this committee for the last four years to really tell the community what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2772.075s">And</a> we should not stop doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2774.356s">Even</a> if we think we're going to have to say we had to make hard decisions and these things have to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2780.12s">We</a> can't stop telling the community like what the public schools need because we will be doing ourselves like a bigger picture disservice that I think this committee has worked really hard to sort of combat against in terms of the You know what the average voter thinks about how we spend our money and that we're doing it responsibly so <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2801.192s">I</a> would like to see a clear, crisper picture of ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2805.535s">And</a> particularly, these are things, if you want to continue these things, we have to find operating budget for them next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2813.04s">It</a> would be really helpful to know that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2818.344s">So</a> those are my ESSER questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2829.992s">It</a> sounds like there's a million and a half dollars not earmarked out of the three remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2837.254s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2881.055s">So,</a> I think on the and I will just ask my last ESSER question and then <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2888.177s">I</a> do have some other questions, but I'm happy to let somebody else ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2890.819s">It</a> sounds like what I counted here was about 1.5 on the FY 24 side out of three. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2897.865s">So</a> there's still a million and a half dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2900.026s">So</a> if some portion of that needs to be held for FY 25, I think we want to know what that is now so that we can make sure that if there is <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2909.045s">cushion</a> there, just like we did last year, like the next presentation you give us can clearly outline like, these are things that belong in the operating budget, but like, if necessary, we could use ESSER to do these things in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2923.708s">So</a> I thought what we did last time worked really well to say like, this stuff is like critical path, we must do it, like we start with the top line fixed costs, then this is critical path, we must do these things, we have to have this stuff, it costs this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2936.707s">And</a> then there's like another category of like, we need to have these things, but we could use ESSA for them for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2941.973s">Versus</a> like, these are the things that are really high priority and like, they could be either bucket, but these are, you know, sort of decisions you're gonna have to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2949.042s">And</a> then we were able to say, we want category A, B and D. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2953.772s">to</a> be part of our ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2955.333s">So</a> I think that was a really effective way for people to understand all those variables.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2967.76s">Yes,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2969.841s">So</a> I think that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2972.362s">And</a> then there's one page where there is an asterisk that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2978.103s">reflects</a> preliminary information as subject to change after the results of the budget surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=2982.026s">Does</a> that mean this list does not integrate what we all put in our budget surveys?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3531.869s">On</a> the page that talks about fixed cost increases, if I am reading this right, I think I have a question about the second bullet, which talks about contractual increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3545.16s">So</a> in one place I saw a million dollars, and in here I see $3.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3552.866s">Just</a> point of information, I'm sorry, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3555.513s">Um</a> on the fixed cost increases slide looks like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3559.834s">Hold</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3560.154s">Let</a> me put my with like the pictures on the bottom.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3562.915s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3563.295s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3563.775s">The</a> happy kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3569.076s">Is</a> it is the increase over FY twenty-three 1 million dollars or 3.3 million dollars?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3601.925s">So</a> yeah, the personnel piece, I know special ed will go up a million and it says vendors will go up 100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3610.271s">But</a> what I'm trying to understand is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3613.032s">The</a> personnel increase, is it $1 million over FY23, or is it $3.3 million over FY23? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3622.094s">And</a> when I say FY23, I mean the number on the front, 68, 994, 776.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3674.085s">If</a> the contractual increases just 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3677.105s">How,</a> how does the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3688.747s">2.5,</a> 2.5, this year's 2.9. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3691.069s">But</a> 68,994 included an increase, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3696.414s">So</a> there's already increase in that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3698.035s">I</a> guess I'm just trying to figure out, what's the real add over 68,994,776? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3702.259s">Probably</a> 4%, because the 2.5%, which was the COLA amount, that's not including steps and lanes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3730.439s">Okay,</a> so 3.3 is the real number.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3750.557s">That's</a> where the 3.3 million- Yeah, I just think my point is all of those budgets assume some amount of increase and paid out, the money paid out of those budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3761.102s">I'm</a> trying to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3763.772s">Are</a> we like taking the whole, are we absorbing like more than just like the increments over one from one budget to the next or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3773.634s">That's</a> I guess what I'm trying to understand because I mean, as it stands, if I add those things up, I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding correctly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3790.247s">If</a> I add all those numbers together and divide by 68, 99, blah, blah, blah, the fixed costs alone go up 6%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3801.809s">If</a> that's right, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3803.609s">It's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3805.11s">That's</a> a huge number because we haven't talked about anything else besides exactly how things are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3814.551s">But</a> I don't want that number to float around if it's not correct.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3947.774s">can</a> I just make a suggestion that we like totally separate the revolving accounts because all of that goes into revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3956.263s">And</a> I think to the point of afterschool, like none of that belongs in the conversation about 68, 996, bloody, bloody, blah, because I think it muddies the water about like what's in there and what isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3969.247s">I</a> think if we can get all of this work done by May 15th, we'll have some breathing room and we could actually have the conversation around revolving accounts that I feel like we've wanted to have for a really long time and we've just never been able to have because it's always like a crunch on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3983.231s">But</a> I think to your point, like if we're, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3986.523s">we're</a> going to incur additional costs like the the user fees need to go up if we're letting people use the building because the cost of letting them do that has gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3996.248s">So,</a> I think and I would just like some transparency overall into our revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4002.191s">It's</a> like sort of broad statement and I know there's like fifteen of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4005.833s">So,</a> it's like some more important than others but community schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4011.81s">And</a> it's a big one where after school, which I actually feel like we know more about than any of the rest, but there's a couple of really big ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4020.354s">There's</a> a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4021.314s">I</a> think there's a pool one that's separate from community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4023.535s">I</a> don't, whatever the big ones are, I would like to know, like, how does money flow in? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4028.457s">How</a> does money flow out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4030.498s">And</a> like, what, what is contributing to all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4034.059s">Because</a> we should be rate setting for all of those things, which <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=4039.72s">we</a> should have the time to do if we're able to finish our budget request by May 15th.<h2><a href="../2023-04-03_X1f0jMHGEbc/2023-04-03_X1f0jMHGEbc.html">4.3.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2903.217s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2904.358s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2904.779s">Yeah,</a> I think there's a lot of places where if we are going to adopt a pay portal like presuming that it has all the appropriate safeguards in place that we should be looking at all the places where we ask families to send money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2921.533s">like</a> lost library books, cash flows in to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2927.838s">And</a> I think it has to go to city hall to come back to be able to buy and replace the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2932.803s">So</a> I'm hoping that if we can really get to a single pay portal for everything that has to do with our schools, it would, it would be a really glorious day for everybody, I think, because I think parents just are like, where do you want me to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2948.596s">What</a> do you want me to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2949.889s">It</a> would be nice if all of that stuff was in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2953.772s">So,</a> and I think on the topic of athletics that was that was a list on my list of questions for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2960.258s">I</a> would like to see athletics be pulled into the mainstream of this website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2965.646s">I</a> think athletics is a critical part of what we do at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2970.068s">And</a> lots of people want to know about our athletics teams, not just our athletics teams, by the way, all the teams that we have, all of our extracurriculars, but it's really sort of hard to find them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2982.895s">And</a> the track team was here a few weeks ago and in going back and forth, the coach has done a really wonderful job maintaining his own website <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2992.574s">for</a> the track team, which is great, but that is a ton of work on him that is over and above all of his other coaching responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3001.178s">So</a> I'd like to see there be a better mechanism for the athletics teams and any of the teams that have a lot of activity to be able to tell the community what they're all about on a website that could be something that meets their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3014.124s">So</a> I do think that is worth looking into, not just for athletics, but for athletics in any of the clubs like the ethics team <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3022.219s">and</a> all the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3024.4s">And</a> then I guess my final question is whether you have found and decommissioned all of the other versions of the website, because every now and then I go searching for something, and I land somewhere that's quite old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3038.085s">So</a> I'm just curious, how can we shut them down in a permanent way so that there's only one place to go?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3070.726s">Every</a> now and then, I land on an old website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3072.466s">I'm</a> like, how did I get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3075.647s">I</a> didn't think I was looking for anything that obscure but I think to my colleague's point, the last thing I'll say is we get a lot of questions about how to find school committee documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3084.588s">So,</a> I will put a resolution on the agenda for us to think about at a future meeting in terms of how we can be better connected to the work that you all are doing and start to address some of the feedback that we get about how to find our documents, where to go, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3101.518s">you</a> know, and sort of all of those, that sort of realm of questions that we get from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3106.64s">So</a> I will do that for a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3108.16s">That'd</a> be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3622.517s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=902.763s">Can</a> I ask a question about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=904.244s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=905.044s">Can</a> you give us an example? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=906.684s">Because</a> I feel like this is one of those sort of dangerous topics, because what we're trying to do is encourage people who are feeling threatened in some way <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=919.778s">to</a> come forward so that the proper people can get involved to investigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=925.903s">And</a> I always get like a little bit concerned when there's emphasis on like falsely doing such a thing, because I think it brings up a lot of questions about like, is it false if you as the administration find that it's not bullying? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=946.59s">Does</a> that make it false? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=947.791s">So</a> I just like, I, I would love a couple of examples of like how this has come up for you all in context to really be able to think through what needs to be in our policy so that we are not discouraging people from bringing forward issues that they're, that they or their children are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=970.004s">Because</a> I feel like that's like the very real danger when you start talking about like consequences for <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=975.807s">or</a> falsely accusing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=978.448s">And</a> I think that's a very serious problem too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=981.049s">I</a> just think like we have to really think carefully about how to do service to like both ends of that spectrum.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1138.268s">I</a> think that's really helpful for us to think through in terms of, you know, not just what does the policy say, like, you know, the law says like, a false accusation, but I think that's different than <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1154.333s">a</a> report being filed that was found to be not bullying, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1158.854s">And</a> there is a differential there, but to hear that from, if you are the aggressor's parent, you certainly would feel like this was a false claim, especially if the administration sided with your child in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1177.077s">So</a> I think that's really important for us to think through in terms of the policy, but also in terms of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1183.312s">how</a> we describe this process to parents and children who end up in it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1191.137s">Like</a> that there are consequences for false accusations, but that is not the same necessarily as, you know, a finding of not bullying, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1205.345s">So</a> thinking about how we describe that for the users of this policy, I think is also really important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1351.885s">Summer</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1355.407s">If</a> a student files a bullying report, is their signature required from the parent as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1372.353s">And</a> I think the other question I have is, should there be some acknowledgement? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1377.355s">Like,</a> are the parents required to acknowledge the filing <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1381.92s">in</a> some way? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1382.461s">I</a> believe- Oh, sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1542.971s">I'm</a> wondering if we can put on the list of questions for our attorney, whether it would be okay to <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1555.525s">um,</a> make the process such that like, we would ideally have a parent's acknowledgement at the, at the time where something is filed, which I think would, I think provide some comfort, maybe all around that we're doing what we can to mitigate like knowingly false accusations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1580.952s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1581.312s">So</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1582.569s">Um,</a> there's like that extra care that when something is sort of on the way in the door, that there's some acknowledgement there from the family that, that they've been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1592.876s">And</a> I think, you know, maybe we have to stop short of making it a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1596.978s">Um,</a> but I would be interested from his perspective, if that's permissible or if that would be seen as like us trying to deter complaints, which I would, I wouldn't want to do either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1607.125s">I</a> just, I'm trying to think of, you know, how to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1611.109s">make</a> this, I think, the process that you all intended to be, which is, you know, a collaboration of school and home, sort of at every step of the way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1769.846s">Um,</a> yeah, I, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1771.567s">I</a> think, um, but I think we should frame it in the policy as. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1777.472s">Anonymous</a> tips, like no, sort of no matter where from, like for like right now we're using Sandy hook, but, um, if an anonymous tip came in some other way, um, I would want us to like take the same treatment of an anonymous tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1793.263s">And</a> I think the question then becomes like in those, in those moments of practice, it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1799.721s">Is</a> it a requirement of the policy that a bullying report be filled out by a school administrator in order to like sort of formally document the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1811.03s">And</a> if so, like, what are the parameters? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1814.973s">Because</a> not every, you know, like you just said, like not every anonymous tip is legitimate and there's lots of ways that you all go about doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1824.14s">But</a> like, at what point does an anonymous tip rise to the level of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1830.195s">but</a> an actual bullying report being filed and opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1836.256s">And</a> so how do we account for that in the policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1838.097s">I</a> think is the question because I think that it won't be every anonymous tip, but I want it to be clear when it should be part of this bullying process so that there can be consistency across school buildings and administrators and <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1859.8s">everybody</a> knows how this all works, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1862.121s">So</a> I think that question becomes like, what are the criteria that we would be expecting the school administrators to apply consistently in that case?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1955.733s">I'm</a> wondering if it would be helpful for everybody on the phone for us to sort of roll through the document in its current form to remind everybody of what is here, because I think this is a great time, particularly with such a huge group of administrators on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1974.641s">I</a> want to be like respectful of the fact that you probably all came here for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1978.457s">And</a> there might be things that are on your mind, and this might be a great audience while we wait for our attorney to weigh in on the policy for you all to identify if there's anything else that you see that you wanna sort of dig into or dive into. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=1996.148s">I</a> know we have a handful of community members on the call as well, but we have a lot of administrators here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2003.913s">So</a> if there's anything that you all are thinking about, it would be great <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2008.664s">use</a> this time to collect all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2010.705s">And</a> I think if we just roll through the document, that might make it easiest.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2315.637s">Can</a> I make two suggestions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2317.057s">One</a> is, and I think we talked about this last time, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2319.997s">Um,</a> that there would be a section of definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2323.219s">So</a> there can be like the introduction to the policy, and then there can be a set of definitions so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2328.061s">Um,</a> the current document has definitions sort of scattered throughout, but that's like one change I would like to see us make. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2334.244s">And</a> then I think the real question about this whole section is, um, who can we govern in our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2345.869s">And</a> the answer is really. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2348.649s">the</a> district, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2350.01s">Like,</a> we cannot actually govern the community with our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2355.273s">So</a> I think this is like, one of those things that is well intentioned, but like, completely unenforceable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2363.618s">If</a> you don't want to build policy that's unenforceable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2365.739s">So</a> I think the question becomes, what, what are the <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2370.387s">the</a> responsibilities that we expect the district administrators to adhere to, what are the responsibilities we expect students to adhere to while they're in our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2379.83s">But</a> beyond that, I think the spirit of what some of this was trying to do is to say, this is not just about what happens in a school building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2392.033s">That</a> this takes all of us and I don't want that message to get lost, but I think it's completely lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2399.115s">in</a> the idea that like, we have some say over what people do in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2404.938s">And</a> if we write it in a policy, then it will be so because it is just simply not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2409.901s">So,</a> but I think the spirit of it, which is that this does take all of us, um, has to come through somehow, but I think it has to be reframed in terms of like, what do we expect the district to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2426.581s">to</a> educate parents and the community about the part they play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2431.443s">I</a> think that we can expect and enforce and prioritize and budget for, but we can't make people come to a six o'clock showing of screenagers, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2445.589s">I</a> was with Mr. Tucci last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2447.73s">It</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2448.851s">We</a> can't make people show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2450.211s">We</a> just can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2451.352s">So</a> to say it's part of our policy that you show up to do something like that is just, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2456.818s">you</a> know, it's not going to get us to the, to the output that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2461.58s">But</a> I think to say things like we will, you know, provide parent education events on an annual basis is a, is actually something that we can accomplish that gets us to that same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2475.485s">So,</a> um, I think unless there's some legal reason why this stuff has to be here, that we strike this because no one's going to read it and we can't enforce it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2484.528s">So</a> let's. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2485.772s">focus</a> on the things, let's focus on the framing of things that we can enforce.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2633.367s">implementation</a> activity or something like that, so that, you know, it can sit somewhere, but it doesn't have to be in the main body of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2643.095s">Because</a> I, you know, I do think like, there will come a time where somebody will say, you know, you don't have this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2655.326s">And</a> we're like, well, yes, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2656.972s">And</a> somebody will say, but you just made it up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2659.034s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2659.394s">And</a> let's say, no, actually we didn't make it up just right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2662.577s">Like</a> look at all of this activity that's been happening since the spring of 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2667.281s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2667.621s">Like</a> there's like these weird edge cases where this stuff becomes very useful and important, even though it's not important the vast majority of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2678.07s">So</a> maybe just some sort of appendix or something that puts in like pre <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2684.799s">like</a> pre-version control history, and then the document will be subject to all the version control that we do going forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2724.545s">I</a> think it's more part of the implementation of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2735.651s">Like</a> it looks like to me, this reads like a continuation of what did we do along the way that <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2742.495s">belongs</a> with this appendix idea.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2918.652s">I</a> don't think this is appropriate for a policy document because first of all, the school committee doesn't have any say over curriculum, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2930.922s">And</a> second of all, like this could change for any number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2935.826s">What</a> the policy needs to say is that it happens every year perhaps, and maybe that an annual presentation of <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2948.133s">you</a> know, the bullying education provided district wide is presented in some way, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2954.14s">Like</a> those are things that the policy can dictate, but I don't, I just think like, and frankly, if you're a parent, like you, like, you're going to, your eyes are going to like gloss over and you're going to keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2966.493s">Cause</a> none of this means anything to you anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2969.097s">Um,</a> and I don't think educators are coming to this document to be like, what should I teach in class today? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2973.518s">Like</a> that's not how they get their instructions either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=2976.099s">So</a> I think it should be deleted, but I don't know if you all agree with that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3373.448s">Do</a> you think there's probably a section of the policy around what we expect of staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3380.79s">Um,</a> that makes a lot of sense, but this is not that, and I don't think this belongs in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3387.891s">Like</a> this seems like a way to say, see, we did professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3391.832s">We</a> gave staff a list of do not do, and we've now checked that off, which is just not how we approach professional development at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3403.632s">Um,</a> so I just, I don't think this belongs here necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3408.594s">Again,</a> it's really more that's more implementation oriented activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3412.656s">Um,</a> but I do think there's some, there's some section about staff responsibilities that, um, make sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3510.759s">I</a> was reading these, like I actually feel like calling these procedures is maybe the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3521.037s">because</a> I think there are some policy components in here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3524.459s">Like</a> building administrators have in place a system for staff that facilitates reporting of incident of unacceptable student behavior towards another student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3532.405s">All</a> incidents are treated with the standard school disciplinary conflict resolution procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3536.348s">Like</a> to me, that doesn't read, that is not a procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3540.211s">That's</a> a statement of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3542.072s">Like</a> the building administrators must have a system in place, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3545.515s">So</a> I feel like what this probably needs to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3550.554s">be</a> rewritten to morph into, I'm happy to take a crack at it, is what is our policy around receiving and witnessing reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3562.959s">Like</a> what is our policy around submitting a report? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3566.221s">And</a> then what is our policy around investigative procedures? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3568.982s">So,</a> you know, I think if I think back over the last like a couple of, you know, six, eight months, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3575.805s">A</a> couple of times I've heard from parents who have been involved in a bullying situation with their student that, for example, they were unhappy that somebody in the administration, and I heard different names associated with this kind of thing, did not call them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3598.799s">And</a> I think the question, and I think sometimes, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3603.7s">That's</a> because there's a process in place where there's like a progressive set of people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3609.824s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3610.224s">So</a> I think that's a good example of like setting the framework of like, who is involved in various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3617.228s">Is</a> it the building principal? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3618.569s">Is</a> it the super like the superintendent can't be involved in every incident of bullying? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3624.232s">Because</a> by definition, she, I believe is some sort of like, sort of last arbiter of any sort of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3632.067s">So</a> I think, but what it's wildly muddy is like what, who is responsible for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3638.388s">So</a> I do think like this section makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3641.449s">It</a> shouldn't be called procedures because these are not procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3645.85s">But</a> I do think there are policy statements in here that make a lot of sense to crystallize like the framework of the process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3658.292s">Like</a> reporting, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3659.786s">Like</a> receiving or witnessing, um, investigating resolution, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3665.549s">So</a> I think that's probably a more effective way to deal with this section of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3672.633s">I</a> don't, maybe that's next and this really can be deleted, but these, many of these are really policy statements and not actual procedures in my mind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3730.274s">Um,</a> you know, the determinations, but having said that, like, I think it's reasonable for the policy to say things like the. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3744.268s">The</a> investigator will interview all students involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3747.911s">Like</a> that is a statement of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3750.194s">You,</a> in order to do this, you, you do have to talk to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3752.976s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3753.256s">So</a> it's written again, I think it's just a rewrite, a reframing of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3800.429s">So-</a> Can I ask a question about, is it number seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3807.188s">So</a> some, you know, as the process unfolds, somebody makes a determination of whether bullying has occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3816.894s">And</a> then it seems like what is implied is if, if bullying did occur, then these things would happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3827.54s">This</a> behavior remediation agreement, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3830.241s">But</a> I think it,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3845.621s">Some</a> leveling of determination that happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3848.722s">It's</a> either bullying or it's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3852.704s">Like</a> there's a handful of like terms, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3855.885s">That,</a> that become the final answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3859.506s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3862.676s">Is</a> there in this document somewhere, we haven't seen it yet, like what is expected if something is described as not bullying, but conflict? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3878.004s">Like</a> is conflict subject to some set of policy or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3885.888s">It's</a> like, if it's conflict, does it just go, like, is it just over? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3888.55s">Does</a> it just disappear out of the policy at that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3891.725s">is</a> there some description that has to occur to make that, yeah, it's like lots of places where conflict is talked about, conflict resolution, that all makes sense, but like, if that's like a final disposition of a bullying report, what does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3908.95s">And</a> if it happens to your child, what can you expect? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3915.512s">Right?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=3928.77s">Is</a> there another disposition that is on the form that ultimately can be decided by the administrator?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4239.62s">that</a> you all are working with families, even when bullying has not been officially like found. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4246.543s">But</a> the form definitely doesn't imply that there's any requirement to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4252.907s">So</a> I think there's probably some change to the form so that it's clear, like if you're filling this out as a family member, like, and you're receiving it back, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4266.519s">it</a> sort of looks like a dead end if you say not bullying, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4270.32s">But</a> I hear people talk about it's not bullying, it's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4273.26s">So</a> it sounds like there's a standard set of language that you all are using that should be reflected in this form that is more than what is listed here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4287.143s">But</a> I think the important thing is that we only are <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4296.397s">it</a> sounds like we are only required to report to DESE the number of bullying incidents that are found to be true, which is what DESE is asking for, so that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4312.566s">And</a> to that end, the definition of bullying, and this is one of those, I think, parent education points. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4320.33s">The</a> definition of bullying is very explicit in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4326.315s">defines</a> bullying for DESE, but that does not mean that we as a district aren't interested in other incidents that may be occurring that may not rise to that level, but are still serious matters and could get in the way of our students' education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4349.819s">So</a> we take those things seriously too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4351.199s">So</a> I think there needs to be some, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4355.137s">way</a> to describe that on the form and some way to describe those different levels, whatever they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4364.844s">And</a> I think we need you all to tell us what they are in this policy so that both of those things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4371.588s">And</a> because, because I think at times what I hear from people is no, no bullying was found and they still feel like something really egregious happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4383.837s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4385.33s">I</a> think the takeaway is because no bullying was found, nobody cares about the thing that they care a lot about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4391.814s">That's</a> happening to their student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4393.855s">And</a> I don't think that's the intent, but that's definitely the takeaway from families that I've talked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4399.098s">And</a> I don't, I think we have an opportunity in this policy to make that not quite be the takeaway in that same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4407.062s">The</a> other thing I would say that I would like to see us add to this policy is what <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4414.023s">Or,</a> and maybe it's not this policy member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4416.884s">So,</a> and it's our reporting policy, but what reporting do we want to see at the school committee level on an annual basis around the efficacy of our bullying policy, which would be more than just like, what do we report to Desi, but how many reports are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4439.23s">How</a> are, how are they being decided? <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4441.151s">You</a> know, what school, <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4442.95s">what</a> school are they coming from, whatever have you, like there has to be some set of reporting requirements that is associated with this policy that will help us know that the policy is being adhered to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4454.639s">So</a> I think we have to come up with that list as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4648.248s">I</a> wondered if I could make a suggestion in the interest of time, which is that one of us take the to-do to talk to our attorney and get answers to these questions of like, what must be in the document, what doesn't need to be in the document, et cetera, and make the update so that the next meeting we have, we're not looking at this same <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4675.121s">document</a> that we all agree is just full of stuff that we don't even particularly want or need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4683.106s">And,</a> um, ask our attorney to come so that whoever does this work and the attorney and our attorney can describe what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4694.433s">And</a> then people have like something new to react to other than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4699.576s">Like,</a> I just don't want to have another meeting with all of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4703.963s">looking</a> at a document that we all know and agree has to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4707.104s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that we ask somebody to do this on our behest so that we can move along.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4879.055s">I</a> will actually hold my question until you're done with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=4882.677s">I</a> just had another question about next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5010.263s">Just</a> about when we might target our next meeting, because I know our April calendar is a little wacky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5019.632s">And</a> I wondered if we might target week of the 24th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5045.629s">We</a> do have a superintendent evaluation subcommittee meeting on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5049.532s">So</a> I think the 25th would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5050.993s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5052.894s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ih84fneWXk0&t=5068.181s">Preferably</a> not, but I could make it work if necessary.<h2><a href="../2023-03-20_aFwV0Rc2Kx0/2023-03-20_aFwV0Rc2Kx0.html">3.20.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5099.31s">Motion</a> to approve?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7289.703s">Any</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7293.385s">We</a> were talking actually at the last meeting about theater not being part of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7299.989s">And</a> it sounds like that's on the plan for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7303.251s">Is</a> that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7303.632s">It</a> is, fingers crossed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7348.722s">And</a> do we have teachers in our rank to do that now, or is that something that we'll have to prioritize at budget time?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=7363.648s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8706.159s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8706.519s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8708.14s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8710.528s">I</a> like where this proposal is going for a bunch of reasons, not the least of which is we, we get a lot of feedback about communication with the afterschool program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8724.513s">We</a> get lots of requests for data. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8726.774s">We</a> get, we have lots of really interested parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8730.195s">And</a> one of the things I hear from parents when they're frustrated is with the best of intention, you're trying to set expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8737.697s">and</a> it's received really, really badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8740.258s">And</a> so suddenly you are the actual problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8743.878s">Because</a> you have said you're 107 on the wait list, like you should make other arrangements, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8749.34s">And</a> I think that's true, accurate and factual, but it's putting you in a position to constantly be peppered with questions about, am I getting closer? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8760.122s">Am</a> I getting closer? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8760.982s">Am</a> I getting closer? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8762.562s">And</a> I think that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8766.846s">intended</a> to be a satisfying thing for people to know that progress is being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8771.828s">But</a> I don't think it actually bears out that way at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8775.25s">I</a> think it just constantly creates this frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8778.631s">So</a> I'm hugely in favor of not pulling a wait list for all the reasons that Member Ruseau talked about and that we've talked about over a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8789.035s">I</a> would like us to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8793.686s">Today,</a> if we're going to take a vote, being the line of marcation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8798.629s">So</a> if you are on the wait list today, you can stay on the list, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8804.652s">We'll</a> process you in and through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8807.354s">But</a> I don't want to create a window. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8811.906s">for</a> people to rush to sign up because then they get on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8816.328s">And</a> then the lottery like becomes this really hollow thing because so many people rush to get on the list that like the lottery can never actually happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8824.872s">And</a> obviously with the kindergartners, like that's like the fresh start through to start setting that precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8831.095s">But</a> I think even for families who may have a first grader or a second grader, like I don't want to create a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8840.933s">we're</a> sort of inflating the number of people on the list because people perceive that that's the way to combat the fact that we're going to move to a lottery-based system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8852.275s">So</a> I think it probably makes sense to think through that as well and to provide some sort of line of demarcation that comes from us so that you don't have to be the arbiter of that decision or be in a position where you have to <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8870.182s">be</a> the like voice of disappointment again and again and again as we make this transition because these transitions are hard for people and I totally like understand and appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8880.851s">So</a> I think this has a lot of merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8883.613s">And</a> I think when we talk about wanting to serve as many people as possible, I think that's it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8892.481s">And</a> it's something we should continue to work toward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8895.863s">But</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8897.468s">the</a> process while we're not there has become a bit untenable for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8904.233s">And</a> my concern is that if it continues to get more and more and more untenable, that we will do what lots of districts do and just say, we can't do this anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8915.121s">And</a> we can't afford for that to happen in Medford because Medford doesn't have other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8921.026s">Lots</a> of these other communities have lots of options and we do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8923.968s">So</a> we can't create <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8926.047s">an</a> environment that continues to like set up this discontent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8929.809s">Um,</a> so I think people maybe be unhappy about this shift, but I would rather like sort of withstand that in the short term, then create a situation where a year from now you all are coming to us and saying, we can't do this anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8942.437s">Like</a> we can't make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8944.379s">It</a> is too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8945.179s">That</a> is what I really want to try to avoid. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8947.12s">And</a> so I do feel like we have to take some active measure to, to get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8951.523s">So</a> I'm totally in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8953.41s">I</a> just would want to make sure that we're super clear about what it is, who gets to stay on the wait list, and who is subject to lottery when that happens.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8977.803s">It's</a> a real concern, especially in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8982.887s">Lots</a> of communities face the same issue in their school-based programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8987.789s">Lots</a> of other communities have lots of other options, and that is not something that we have here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=8992.412s">We</a> just don't.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9627.228s">I</a> just also want to point out that I don't think the takeaway should be that we raised our rates so everybody else did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9633.431s">There's</a> an entire economic set of factors at play that make jobs like this a completely different animal today than they were two years ago or three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9647.178s">And</a> so if we want to compete in the economic reality, like we <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9652.762s">I</a> think we did the right thing two years ago and what you're proposing here is the right thing in the right now because wages don't go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9660.869s">That</a> just really doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9663.171s">So</a> if we don't do this, I think we're going to be able to service even fewer kids next year because we will have fewer staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=9670.718s">So</a> we need to make sure that we're prioritizing serving as many kids as we possibly can.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10134.482s">No</a> problem.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10190.827s">The</a> new rates that you're proposing would not include any change to the sliding scale rate that we created last year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10208.201s">I</a> meant the tuition rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10210.123s">So</a> what we created, so last year, right, we said if you qualify, you keep the rate from the prior year, and now everybody else sort of ticked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10220.222s">and</a> everyone else is gonna tick up again, is that rate flat or are you saying that's also going to tick up?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10255.084s">So</a> in other words, the way the program works is based on your income threshold, you get a percentage off. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10260.929s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10261.449s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10262.17s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10262.47s">So</a> if we do what member Rousseau is suggesting, and we make that rate much higher than those percent, that does make the program less affordable for those folks that are at that, at that, um, at those tiered levels, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10277.942s">The</a> sliding scale.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10290.288s">So</a> I wondered, maybe I'll just try to like spit out a motion and you guys can tell me if you love it or hate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10299.113s">Can</a> I make a motion that you will investigate what the financials could look like to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10309.864s">the</a> sliding scale cost flat while providing an increase to the market rate that is bigger than what you've outlined here and bring that back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10328.631s">Does</a> that make any sense at all?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10342.376s">So</a> yeah in other words how could you keep the sliding scale like actual cost yep the same and what would a corresponding increase to the market rate need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10357.617s">increase</a> over and above what you have here in order for all of your financials to still work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10362.059s">Because</a> your program has to be liquid in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10367.482s">So</a> we can't like say yes to one thing and no to another thing without understanding, does it all work together? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10373.544s">So</a> I think my request is a slightly different cut at this that <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10379.775s">preserves</a> the actual dollar cost for the sliding scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10386.456s">And</a> that might just mean changes to how the sliding scale works. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10390.017s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10391.577s">But</a> what would it take to offset and keep the program liquid all in, assuming the staff rates and all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10400.359s">I</a> don't want us to make one-off decisions, because you can't operate the program if we make a series of one-off decisions that don't actually work together.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10559.457s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10562.218s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10562.758s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10564.158s">Can</a> I just invite you to join us on Zoom next week if you would prefer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10569.561s">We</a> would love to have you here because there's plenty of chairs, but we get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10576.763s">If</a> you want to join us on Zoom, I think that's totally fine, and I just want you to do what you need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10582.166s">We</a> can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=10583.387s">whether</a> you're on the camera or not, as long as my colleagues are in agreement.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11793.626s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11794.527s">Thank</a> you for the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11795.647s">I</a> know I've peppered you with a lot of questions and I just wanted to like read this out for people who don't have this in front of them and we should make it available. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11808.135s">One</a> of the questions was like, how do we know what evidence do we have that there are fewer students out of class? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11813.878s">And</a> the superintendent provided us a chart on this report that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11819.441s">And</a> in September, the average number of classes cut per day for the student body was 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11825.885s">In</a> October, it was 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11828.367s">In</a> November, it was 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11831.589s">In</a> December, it was 43. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11834.771s">In</a> January, it was 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11838.673s">And</a> in February, it was 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11840.655s">So</a> I just wanted to point out that this is a really great example of data telling us that it worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11848.642s">or</a> it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11849.623s">I</a> think it also tells us that things weren't working between October and December, which is unfortunate because I think we had ample warning in October that we had an issue that was not responded to in the best way possible because now we're seeing that when we respond with rules and structure for our high school campus, things get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11870.435s">So</a> I think that's really great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11873.517s">The</a> other thing that I wanted to point out is I think <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11876.42s">I</a> think that the conversation around having seven building monitors, um, but also being limited to the number of bathrooms we can open tells me that that equation is not quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11888.327s">Um,</a> so I think, I'm not sure there's much to do about it like right now in this moment, but when we talk about the budget for next year, like I do want to know, like, how do we open the bathrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11900.874s">Because</a> we as a committee have talked about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11904.46s">multiple</a> times a year every year since I've been on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11906.681s">And</a> I would really love not to talk about whether the bathrooms are or aren't open again at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11913.663s">But</a> I don't say that to mean that I don't care that it's a lawless land inside the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11919.645s">That's</a> not the point at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11921.046s">But</a> in order for there to be ample open bathrooms available for students wherever their classes are, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11930.316s">seven</a> may not be the right magical number based on the information that's provided here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11934.937s">So</a> again, I just would like to see us think about that during the budget and figure out like what really is sustainable because, you know, relying on people to fill in who also have to be expected to fill in for teachers that don't come because we have no substitutes seems like it's actually not super sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11953.062s">So</a> I just want to make sure that as we head into next year, as we begin a principal search that we're going to set up <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11960.182s">whoever</a> our new principle is for success with like systems and structures that work and are sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11965.463s">So</a> I think that's really important for us to think about as we go forward and as we build the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=11969.684s">So</a> thank you for this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12262.147s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12262.708s">I</a> think the other thing, the rules and policy subcommittee is working on a refresh of the bullying policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12271.493s">And</a> we had a lot of conversation in the last meeting that we held around the district's obligations in terms of awareness and making sure people understand the steps <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12286.417s">and</a> making sure that there's some proactive measure happening when parents are talking about or students are talking about how they may be struggling so that people know what those options are and what the protocol is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12300.468s">So</a> I do think that the revised policy that comes out will have <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12307.074s">some</a> additional steps to try to like close the gap, because I think the gap that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12311.618s">Branley</a> is talking about is real, which is if you didn't know that that was the thing you were supposed to do, you didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12317.543s">And</a> we can't, we can't know how many people fall into that situation, but we can be aware that it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12325.95s">It</a> happened at least, you know, we're hearing that from one person, but we have heard that from many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12332.136s">And</a> I think as we do finish the policy work, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12335.219s">it'll</a> be important to make sure that when we talk about that policy and the translation to practice, that there is a way to sort of close that gap that doesn't dilute the meaningfulness of the information that you need to actually properly investigate a bullying report, but does close the gap around the unreported, which is what's really, really hard to get at. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=12361.092s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2023-03-06_2k0-S7zh4xE/2023-03-06_2k0-S7zh4xE.html">3.6.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1101.563s">Thank</a> you member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1103.846s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1105.304s">Why</a> does Sandy Hook require us to sign agreements that you can't disclose the amount of reporting coming in?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1130.845s">And</a> so how will we or the public or students know that the program is being executed with integrity and fidelity and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1142.941s">Like</a> if there's no reporting, how does anybody know that it's working? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=1147.166s">I</a> guess that's what I'm trying to understand.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4267.331s">It's</a> great to hear we're making some progress on recruiting additional support for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4274.675s">This</a> is not the first time we've had athletics related discussions where we've not only lacked a person to play the role, but we've lacked a person with a skill set to be the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4287.422s">And</a> I just want to ask that before we, if we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4292.108s">putting</a> somebody in place to help with administrative items and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4295.79s">Obviously</a> like that's its own skill and you don't have to know how to throw a javelin, but we do need to find qualified coaches who have skill and can teach the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4306.836s">So</a> I know that we're kind of coming up fast and I hope that some of these folks have skills that are complimentary to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4314.58s">So</a> we don't have like a bunch of sprinting coaches and no coaches for the field events, but I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4319.995s">I</a> think we need to invest a little bit more energy in recruitment and really tapping people on the shoulders. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4328.001s">I</a> had a conversation with a parent today about alumni and what are we doing to convince alumni to come back and coach and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4335.866s">So</a> I just think there's a lot of work to do in the long term that is over and above what has to happen to make sure the season in the spring can proceed, that we should not <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4348.648s">shy</a> away from just because the immediate issue is resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4351.85s">So</a> I think, you know, we've heard this with other sports teams as well over time, and I'm sure the stipends have something to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4358.554s">But</a> we also just need to put forth the effort to go out and find the people with the qualifications that are going to be the best coaches for the students that we are trying to teach.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4403.39s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4403.73s">And,</a> you know, certainly in fairness to coach Donlan, as he had a really big task ahead of him, it's really hard to think strategically about how to grow a program, how to bring in professional development, how to create like a pipeline of students that want to come back and all the things, if you are mired in basic supervision and all the, you know, all the other stuff that is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4427.583s">but</a> doesn't create a program that has like its own sort of life line to hang on to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4436.79s">So</a> I think, you know, and again, I think this is probably true of lots of our sports teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4443.875s">What</a> is our strategic plan for each of these sports and what is needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4449.319s">I</a> think we've asked questions before about the athletics revolving account and I don't know that we've ever seen anything that like <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4456.465s">paints</a> a really clear picture of what's going on at in the various sports, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4462.319s">asking</a> the athletics department to start to think about the strategy around how do we create high caliber, high quality athletics teams? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4472.127s">How</a> does that contribute to students staying for Medford and going to Medford High and not leaving for all the other schools in the area that are relying on schools like ours to train middle school students and then coach them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4488.044s">So</a> how do we create a situation where we have some strategic planning going on that starts to sort of shift that at various sports, I think is a conversation we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4500.507s">And</a> it obviously needs some dedicated budget and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4503.807s">But</a> I think it's really important as we think about the whole child and what gets kids up in the morning to go to school and what constitutes an education. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4514.249s">It's</a> not just about what they learn in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4518.143s">And</a> maybe it's athletics, maybe it's track, maybe it's e-sports, like it could be any of those things or none of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4524.368s">Or</a> theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4525.289s">What's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4525.809s">Or</a> theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4526.59s">Or</a> theater, all the things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4528.471s">And</a> so how do we try to pay a little bit of mind to that part of the educational experience as well is something that I think when we talk about climate and culture at the high school, that all sort of wraps together for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4542.562s">And</a> I want to see us make some progress on that in the next year, year and a half.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6118.357s">thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6120.659s">April</a> 18 is during school vacation week.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6128.563s">Um</a> and I guess I was looking at sort of the cadence of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6131.865s">So,</a> there's like four planned budget hearings on our list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6137.468s">Um</a> I think we could probably like do it in three if they are not attached to other like <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6145.964s">You</a> may not need to find, in my opinion, you might not need to find a replacement for that meeting if the sequence of topics can shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6153.634s">I</a> can't imagine that we could spend an entire meeting talking about the increase of the out-of-district tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6162.531s">It</a> is, it is true right and so there's probably like lots of opportunity for us to talk about other things so that line up with the priorities that we will all share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6173.005s">So</a> I think, you know, maybe we don't need for maybe three is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6178.399s">And</a> that would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6180.201s">I</a> think the virtual listening session, is that the same as the budget hearing that we are required to have as a school committee by law about the budget, or that is something separate completely?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6223.769s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6224.71s">Um,</a> and that, so I think the only other thing that we should try to do on this schedule is identify when that like statutory budget hearing is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6233.358s">Um,</a> it can, I think it can happen at a regular school committee meeting as long as it's posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6238.103s">So</a> maybe may 15th is the right time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6241.306s">Um,</a> or it's just like where in the calendar that falls so that we don't lose sight of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6246.954s">I'll</a> mark the May 15th date as the... So then people will have an opportunity to go to the listening sessions and participate in these meetings all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6259.043s">And</a> then that can be the formal hearing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6266.249s">I</a> think it could go either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6267.47s">I</a> think it just has to be noticed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6296.087s">Well,</a> our approval of the final budget is not until June. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6299.749s">So</a> there's like the request and then there's actually like approving the budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6304.773s">So</a> there's two steps in our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6307.675s">And</a> I don't know that the law says specifically like, cause the budget isn't approved until it is a real number, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6319.182s">Or</a> not approvable until it's a real number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=6321.003s">Our</a> request is just a request.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7059.795s">So,</a> as we're talking, I'm wondering if like to be really concrete, we could say that our goal starting in the fall is that the agendas will be translated so that people proactively can understand what's happening and that there's a mechanism for folks who may want to participate in our meeting to tell us that so that we can do what we can do to get services here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7089.474s">And</a> then second part being the town hall listening session so that those are concrete, measurable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7096.998s">We</a> can see it, we can observe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7098.439s">We</a> have an agenda that's translated each week, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7102.301s">So</a> I think that would be a great way to start to focus on helping people proactively understand what happens here at the school committee meeting and know what is on the agenda even. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7116.349s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7117.998s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7205.921s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7207.802s">I</a> just think we have to start somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7210.444s">And</a> if we try to start, like, too big, I think we're going to struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7217.388s">I</a> just don't want to see us get none of the things done because we're trying to do too many things all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7225.073s">So,</a> and, you know, this is through November. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7228.615s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7229.645s">If</a> we can make that part of the process, hopefully we have our new communications director on board, then come November and December, we can be talking about that next iteration after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7243.028s">I</a> guess that's my thought.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7551.355s">Is</a> is this the only are we where we can still have other goals, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7555.557s">We</a> haven't talked about Medford High and I don't think we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7558.259s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7558.919s">Um</a> I don't think we can like button it up if we have not addressed anything about Medford High.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7585.521s">So</a> I do think one of our goals has to be around creating and approving an action plan for the next school year at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7596.883s">So</a> we talked about the action plan that's in place like right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7601.744s">We</a> have a consultant who's doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7604.165s">We</a> have a climate survey that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7606.285s">We</a> have a climate and culture assessment that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7608.566s">So</a> we've all these things happening and the output of all of that is meaningless <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7614.437s">if</a> we don't create an action plan that turns those things into observable change in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7622.039s">So</a> I think one of the things that's incumbent on us to do is to request and approve an action plan for the high school for the next school year, ideally around the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7636.984s">But</a> I think it's the single hottest <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7642.799s">question</a> in the community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7645.701s">And</a> we need to make sure that we're being responsive to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7649.244s">And</a> that as we talk about the budget, as we talk about all these things, that we are aligning with these goals that we're going to create to drive some of those budget decisions that we inevitably always have to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7661.012s">So</a> I want to make sure that things like, do we have enough assistant principals gets talked about, discussed, prioritized, all of those things when we are handling the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7672.83s">I</a> feel like talking about it as the creation of a FY24 action plan and approval by this committee of what that action plan is for the FY24 school year is probably the right way to describe it right now, because we have all these moving parts that are still coming into focus.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7731.078s">want</a> to be, we would want to approve the plan, you know, around the start of school, so maybe by October 1st, because then we want to see it executed right across the year and be able to say, we're doing these things, we've done these things, here's what's changing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8393.757s">Can</a> I, Member Graham, just cite some concern about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8398.56s">So</a> right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8400.945s">There</a> really is no policy around naming and I don't want to create a vacuum where everyone decides like we're gonna rush and name everything that we can like name in the schools however we want because the policy doesn't exist until July 1st and nobody can say anything about it and then we've got sort of like a angry mess to unwind. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8422.87s">So</a> I'm not in favor of delaying the implementation of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8428.193s">I</a> think if people want to bring forward a request, the policy has lots of ways to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8433.437s">And</a> it should go into effect immediately.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8594.929s">I</a> just had some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8595.93s">I</a> think, generally speaking, what I thought this was trying to do is make sure there's a formal place for students to speak to us, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8606.197s">Which</a> I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8608.219s">I</a> feel like this might not, like there's other ways that school committees do this, much more simply than telling students they're gonna come and we're not gonna talk to them and then they, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8621.101s">that</a> feels sort of onerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8623.123s">I</a> think there's lots of other ways school committees are doing that like really regularly, especially with student reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8628.908s">And</a> of course, students are always part of public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8632.01s">So</a> I guess my thought would be to make sure that we all agree that we want to like <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8638.561s">put</a> a formal place on the agenda for students to speak and then ask the rules policy subcommittee to like work this into the agenda in a like cohesive fashion so that it's part of the policy, it's part of our rules, it's part of all the things because there is a policy change here that has to go through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=8656.965s">So</a> I think the rules committee, the policy committee could do that if we are clear on what the intent is, which is to be able to hear student voices.<h2><a href="../2023-03-02_goLe37yQgNQ/2023-03-02_goLe37yQgNQ.html">MSC Rules & Policy Subcommittee Meeting 3.2.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1004.477s">I</a> totally understand the spirit of what this paragraph is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1010.481s">I</a> think it's rather poorly worded and confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1013.783s">So</a> I think there is a difference between how things that happen outside of school impact students during school in the building and who is responsible for taking action for discreetly things that happen outside of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1033.094s">And</a> I think this paragraph is worded in such a way that those two things are like completely muddled together. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1039.675s">But</a> I think like in your summer camp example, like if there was a situation at summer camp, like the school district would not supersede, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1052.937s">Like</a> the activity and the responsibility of the summer camp simply because the two students happened to be students that met for public schools or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1062.61s">And</a> to the extent that that issue was like handled and resolved during the summer at summer camp or wherever they are, that would sort of be outside the sort of fringe of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1080.82s">But</a> if there's something that starts in summer and makes its way into the building such that it is like infringing on a student's rights, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1091.633s">to</a> an education, that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1094.395s">So</a> I feel like this paragraph is poorly worded because it like muddies the water and makes it sound like the school is the arbiter of literally every possible bullying situation that an individual might come in contact with simply because they go to Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1114.748s">I</a> don't think that's the intent of the paragraph, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1118.462s">that</a> was certainly how I read it the first time and I was sort of taken aback. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1122.223s">So</a> I think there's some rewording there that would clarify those boundaries in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1129.764s">And</a> maybe at some point in the policy, there need to be some examples that would make that clear for people so people understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1138.166s">But</a> I think that was my read of this paragraph was just that the paragraph simply needs work. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1146.888s">It's</a> a pretty, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1148.475s">And</a> I think this is a criticism of the document in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1151.696s">Like</a> that's a very long, complicated sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1156.097s">That's</a> one sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1158.318s">And</a> it's full of like qualifiers and commas and all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1163.6s">Like,</a> so that's only one sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1167.841s">It's</a> like the length of a paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1169.421s">Like</a> it's far too complex to be understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1173.923s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1175.117s">the</a> point of all of our policy should be to be clear and understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1178.819s">So</a> I think that's a big part of the problem that I have with this particular sentence.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1327.013s">Yeah,</a> I guess this document is enough of a mess that it would be a pretty egregious use of taxpayer dollars to ask Howard to <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1340.398s">clean</a> this up in its current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1342.019s">So</a> I do think we need his, like his eye and his lens on this, but I think there's. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1347.982s">A</a> considerable amount of work to do before, um, we get to the point where that's a good use of his time and our money for him to, to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1356.527s">Like,</a> you know, for example, there's three places where there are definitions in this document, like that, that can't be, there needs to be one place where all the definitions exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1367.915s">So</a> I think there is like a first pass we need to take through this and then bring Howard in for the like more legal spin and making sure that the intent of the law is being carried out in this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1380.038s">But</a> I think there is like a lot of work that we can do before we're going to be at a stopping point to bring Howard into the mix.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2019.892s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2020.233s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2020.873s">Um,</a> I was going to ask that there be a section for definitions that includes bullying and cyber bullying and whatever this met for public school paragraph is at the bottom probably is a different topic, but there also are definitions on page 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2037.52s">And</a> on page 26, and I didn't look to see if they are in conflict with each other, but I think they all like definitions need to be in one place, either right here or at the back of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2050.65s">Um,</a> because right now they're just like scattered all over the document and the same words are being used again and again and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2058.036s">So</a> I'd like to see us on those other definitions up here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2063.66s">And</a> just make a section about. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2065.959s">definitions</a> to consolidate that and make it a little bit more cohesive.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2487.713s">Yeah,</a> I'd like also to see us add a section to this document around <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2496.115s">the</a> district's administrative obligations around education. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2499.958s">So</a> I think it's perfectly appropriate for us to set policy that says the district will do certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2510.026s">And</a> we should have, and it should, there's stuff in here that's like a clear, like example of why doing that is like,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2531.724s">So</a> I think there's some like clear examples in this document of why like sort of putting policy directives around what the district will do doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2542.591s">However,</a> I do think like some sort of like annual obligations that the district has around education <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2553.495s">would</a> be important provided that we can like craft it in a way that is not as prescriptive that it becomes useless, which I think most of this document sort of falls into. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2564.582s">Um,</a> but I think instead to say from a policy perspective, we will, uh, you know, at the beginning of the year, do X and on an annual basis, we'll do Y that kind of thing, I think would be appropriate somewhere in the document, um, to add a section because I didn't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2581.76s">I</a> didn't see that in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2582.901s">Maybe</a> it may just be scattered all about, but I didn't see anything about making this digestible for students and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2593.65s">Like</a> this document is by definition, not digestible for anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2598.454s">And</a> I think beyond having a document that's digestible, which I think we need to work to, I think the way you make documents digestible, as you talk about them, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2610.957s">in</a> a consistent way, and then you demonstrate that those things happen in a consistent way. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2615.12s">So</a> I think there is good reason to add something like that to the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2619.882s">I'm</a> happy to draft something before the next meeting, and you can share it and insert it at that time, but I'll leave that to the group.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2818.488s">I</a> feel like you could change it to information and it, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2821.341s">would</a> at least be understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2823.041s">I</a> like that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2881.014s">Just</a> come to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2884.817s">In</a> that paragraph where it says cyberbullying includes, and then it has all these like parenthetical, like one, two, three, like, can we not use that sort of nomenclature? <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2896.863s">Because</a> I feel like it's really hard to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2899.285s">Like,</a> I think putting that in actual bullets would make much more sense, like cyberbullying includes, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2907.212s">that's</a> a bullet, there's another bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2908.893s">And</a> then there's like another sentence that is, I think, another bullet that is just structured completely differently than all the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2915.176s">And</a> some of this stuff we just probably are gonna need to clean up multiple times, but I think trying to make this stuff understandable is like its own body of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2926.801s">And</a> I think what we heard in the last meeting was like, if you could get through the document, it's sort of all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2938.057s">And</a> we actually have a bigger problem with doing the things that are in this document than we do with like having written the right things down on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2947.561s">And</a> I have to attribute at least some of that to this document being so complicated to like read and internalize. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2956.905s">So</a> I think for our part, like we can commit to making this a more readable document. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2965.676s">And</a> so that for the part on the, the principals and the assistant principals and the administrators who need to do this, like that, they, that we've done our part to like make their job easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2976.966s">Cause</a> their job is already hard enough on this front without trying to like, sort of, we weighed knee deep through the language here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3264.27s">Um,</a> just one thing about the HECAT before we, like, move on that I want to make clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3270.632s">That</a> committee is not an advisory committee to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3274.133s">That</a> committee was established by the superintendent who has <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3279.201s">the</a> full purview of curriculum selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3282.543s">So</a> the fact that those meetings are not public and there are not minutes being published in the public are because the superintendent in her role is not subject to the open meeting law the same way that the school committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3294.589s">So</a> there's nothing inappropriate going on that the superintendent absolutely has the full latitude to do exactly what she's doing and establish a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3304.955s">She</a> happened to ask that the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3307.867s">have</a> somebody participate, and that's member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3311.229s">So</a> I just wanted to like put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3312.669s">I</a> do think for this policy, like what's important is that as a matter of policy, that we will maintain and deliver high quality bullying prevention and bystander training, I think is the appropriate thing for this to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3332.411s">I</a> don't know what the rest of the paragraph says, but I think that's the appropriate thing from a policy perspective that belongs in here around the bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3342.837s">But</a> we should stop short of naming a particular curriculum because the school committee does not have the authority to select curriculum and putting it in a policy document means we will surely be out of compliance at some point in time when the curriculum changes and we forget that it was in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3358.826s">So</a> I just wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3361.419s">suggest</a> that somewhere in this document in some iteration, we identify that that is a requirement of this policy, that it's our policy that the administration like maintain and deliver high quality curriculum, but that it doesn't have to be more like definitive or explicit or prescriptive than that because this is a policy document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3604.847s">I</a> wanted to say something about the flowchart.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3610.057s">Um,</a> I, I do think, um, there's a lot of opportunity to improve this flow chart, particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3616.378s">Um,</a> beyond some of the visual, like this does not clearly talk about accountability and who is responsible for what, um, and a good flow chart always clearly outlines, um, who is responsible for actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3630.982s">So</a> I think, um, I think there's a lot of opportunity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3633.982s">I'd</a> like to suggest that, um, if we. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3637.706s">intend</a> to include this in our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3640.348s">Um,</a> and maybe we can talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3644.432s">Uh,</a> that, you know, one of us take a shot at what a revised flow chart might look like, and then, um, bring it back to the group and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3653.079s">Um,</a> I think we're going to have to, you know, find a way to like divide and conquer this document, um, because we're going to be meeting until the end of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3664.512s">If</a> we don't be happy to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3724.691s">Yeah,</a> I understand that completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3727.172s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3728.524s">it's,</a> you know, there's going to be a lot of places where there are many people who can be involved in a step, which I think does make it confusing, especially for a parent who was like just trotting along their, their year and found themselves in a situation where they needed to pay attention to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3745.574s">Like</a> it shouldn't be hard for them to understand who they can expect to engage with them and <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3752.666s">And</a> I think like anytime you make a long list like this, like you should report it to your teacher, your coach, your guidance Councilor, your nurse, your assistant principal, or your principal or other school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3760.472s">Like</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3761.773s">It's</a> like all encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3763.575s">But</a> if you are the person reading this and you're like, I have a problem and I don't know who to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3767.638s">And</a> you read this, like, I don't think it helps you make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3771.901s">And</a> so that may not be the purpose or intent of the policy, but something has to help people with a clear path. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3781.265s">at</a> a time when something traumatic is happening, either to them or their child, to say, like, if I do this, the right next steps will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3791.529s">And</a> I won't fall into a situation where I did the wrong thing because I thought I did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3797.651s">And</a> so I think it doesn't, I think in the policy, this language is fine, but in the, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3804.88s">parent-facing</a> simple flow chart, that needs to be really clear to them so that they're not working harder to figure out how to tell somebody something's going wrong than they are about taking care of their child, for example, or making sure there's some immediate action happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3823.529s">So</a> I think those two documents, they don't have to say exactly the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3827.53s">They</a> can be for different purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3829.651s">But</a> I do think one of those documents, I think the flow chart, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3833.605s">has</a> to be crystal clear for parents about what to do and who they can expect to respond when they raise an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3843.75s">Because</a> I think what I've heard again and again from parents who have been in this situation is they all thought they did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3853.214s">And</a> then they found out that they missed a step in the process or they <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3858.856s">said</a> the wrong word. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3860.137s">And</a> I just, we have to find a way past those hiccups because I think they are catastrophic in terms of the relationship that we're trying to have with parents.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4219.24s">Yeah,</a> I feel pretty strongly that there have to be timelines of some kind in some way, for all the reasons that Member Ruseau describes, but also because <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4233.883s">It's</a> reasonable in life to expect there to be an expectation of how long something's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4240.545s">Like</a> that is the world that we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4243.186s">And</a> I think it's also important for us to acknowledge that we haven't always done this all that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4251.129s">And</a> in order to like earn the trust of the public, we have to set forth a parameter of how we intend to operate so that they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4262.69s">so</a> that if something goes awry, that we can be alerted that something has gone awry. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4268.514s">Because</a> I think that there are times where we're not alerted that things go awry, because everybody thinks somebody knows something about it, and that's maybe not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4277.059s">So</a> I do think for the efficacy of the process, there has to be a timeline as an important check and balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4284.304s">But</a> I think that timeline can be written such that if there is more time needed to properly investigate, <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4291.873s">that</a> is an acceptable thing to have happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4296.277s">But</a> we have to be able to explain to somebody reading this document, why that would be like most people when they're something happens to their child, they think like this is going to be arbitrated, especially at elementary school, like immediately in the classroom by the teacher the next day done. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4312.73s">And</a> that's not the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4314.392s">But</a> I think we've never done a good job of educating people at just how time consuming these things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4320.968s">and</a> why they're time-consuming and why it matters that we are taking our time to do our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4326.753s">A,</a> it's the law, B, it's the right thing to do, C, there's a lot of students, there can be a lot of students involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4332.918s">It's</a> incumbent upon us to describe that to the users of this document so that they have an appropriate understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4344.008s">Otherwise,</a> they will make their own requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4347.094s">of</a> what we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4348.436s">And</a> that's never going to align with our reality of like just how time consuming some of this stuff is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4648.365s">I</a> would actually recommend that this entire section be removed because this is a policy document. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4656.052s">And</a> I think the policy should be that we will, that the administration will maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4664.82s">uh,</a> compiled guide about internet safety and cyber bullying and distribute it on an annual basis or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4672.503s">Um,</a> rather than putting these links in here that again, like links change and these may. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4678.826s">Not</a> like if you ask Mr. Tucci, like, does he even use these links actively? <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4684.208s">Like</a> he may use something completely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4685.968s">So</a> I think this, this section is just to come out, um, in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4693.09s">requirements</a> that the administration on an annual basis, like maintain this resource on the number of folks.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4906.84s">I</a> just want to be mindful of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4910.524s">We</a> have eight minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4912.346s">And</a> I'm wondering if I have some like overarching comments about like, I think this whole section about health education scope and sequence does not belong here and should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4925.401s">And</a> then there's another section immediately after it. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4930.145s">That</a> also I think should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4932.006s">Oh,</a> academic and non-academic activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4934.886s">Like</a> this doesn't belong here either. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4936.707s">In</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4939.728s">So</a> I'd like to see those two things be removed, but I'm just wondering if in the interest of time, if it makes sense for us to just have you start back at the top, scroll through the entire document so that everybody can see for the record, what changes exist in here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4959.02s">Um,</a> and then agree on like when we will reconvene with our like respective components so that, um, the next time we come together, like we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4969.268s">Put</a> all of those components together and then think about what's the next iteration of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4974.772s">But</a> I think if we could do the definitions, we could get some input from Howard about what's required and what's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4981.377s">We</a> could do the flow chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4982.578s">And</a> then, um, I say I would do, Oh, the district's educational obligations section, like to write that. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4989.505s">we</a> would be on our way to a cohesive document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5130.27s">I'm</a> serious if we're gonna, I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5134.233s">Is</a> it reasonable for us to do those takeaways meet again in a week or do we need two weeks?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5300.994s">The</a> high school course selection night is also on the 15th now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5378.412s">District</a> education obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5380.693s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5381.013s">Yes,</a> that's right right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5411.767s">Yeah,</a> I definitely can do that, but I think we need to answer some of these other questions before I do that, because otherwise like it's going to get pretty convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5423.492s">So</a> I think that happens next.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5452.91s">Are</a> you also going to check in on the sections <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5457.443s">and</a> whether they're required.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5548.256s">Okay,</a> I'm happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5549.537s">I</a> feel like you have plenty of other things to do, so I can take it if you'd like.<h2><a href="../2023-02-27_bIcF9zSptpQ/2023-02-27_bIcF9zSptpQ.html">2.27.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=0.089s">superintendent</a> has that in the same way that we ask for documents for our posted meetings to come to us, you know, not the same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8.373s">I</a> think that is reasonable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1508.774s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1509.334s">Motion</a> for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1510.414s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1512.194s">I</a> just wanted to second and also say congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1516.656s">You</a> guys did a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1518.582s">and</a> you will do great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=1521.343s">Member</a> Kreatz?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5560.485s">I'd</a> like to ask that on Monday's agenda, an immediate action plan be presented to us to stabilize the spring season, address equipment issues, what that cost will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5572.134s">I</a> want to thank you all for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5573.716s">I</a> think I mentioned to Beth via email that no request has ever come to the committee to fund broken equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5582.202s">I</a> think we're all <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5584.483s">obviously</a> concerned about safety, but also overwhelmingly, we have been asking the administration to tell us what they need since I've been on the committee for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5595.448s">And</a> this is an example of something that is needed that hasn't been brought to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5600.29s">So</a> thank you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5601.69s">I'm</a> sorry that you had to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5603.871s">our</a> internal processes should be better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5607.634s">And</a> we need to work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5609.115s">So</a> I would like to ask that this be on the agenda next week with a pretty comprehensive plan about what we will do in the near term. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5617.06s">And</a> then I think I will probably also fashion a motion in a broad <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5624.753s">way</a> to talk about athletics, staffing and coaching in general, but I can't like on the fly, think about what those asks are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5633.596s">So</a> I will submit that formally later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=5636.337s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=7254.32s">Did</a> you want to finish your read through or did you want to take questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8589.93s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8591.274s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8593.055s">I</a> actually have a lot of questions based on this and I'm wondering because I think most of my questions are about what have we observed that demonstrates that this thing that we said we were going to do is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8614.932s">It's</a> less about did we do the things we said we would do that's important, but did they work, I think, is the question that I have and it's like I can happy to send you a whole list of questions but. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8625.902s">I</a> think in fairness, like it's gonna take some time to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8629.504s">So</a> I'm wondering if it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8631.685s">And</a> probably my colleagues have other questions as well for us to share with you what some of our questions are that we'd like to see answered in the next time that this comes up and maybe not on Monday, but the following meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8645.332s">But</a> I think a lot of the questions I had was, how long are the waits in the bathroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8650.875s">the</a> question that came up like, why do students not know which bathrooms are open? <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8654.396s">Why</a> aren't enough bathrooms open? <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8655.776s">So</a> there's just, there's a lot of really tactical questions that came up for me as I was reading these things that I'm happy to send you if we can put this on the agenda again in two weeks, because I think that's, I think this is an ongoing conversation and it's a culture change and you know, it's all the things that take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8674.861s">So</a> rather than, <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8677.495s">try</a> to ask you really specific questions tonight that in fairness, you probably can't answer tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=8683.236s">I</a> think that might make more sense, but I don't know if my colleagues agree with that approach or if you'd rather me just ask them tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9046.754s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9048.274s">This</a> is the policy that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9051.77s">um</a> worked on in our subcommittee meeting at the beginning of February um and it reflects I think uh all the things that the MASC recommends that our um naming policy reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9066.075s">Um</a> I just have two amendments to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9068.015s">One</a> is that um the policy number for lack of a better term because their letters um is policy FF. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9075.577s">That's</a> where it would sit in our policy handbook <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9078.112s">And</a> then a legal reference can be added for Mass General Law, Part 1, Title 7, Chapter 43, Section 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9086.359s">And</a> I did speak with Attorney Greenspan earlier today to confirm that that was the appropriate reference that goes with this policy, because it was not clearly listed on the MASC model policy either. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9101.846s">happy</a> to take any questions that people have about what we put together, but I would otherwise recommend this past first reading.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9120.795s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9122.176s">National</a> law, part one, title seven, chapter 43, section 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=9130.302s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=181.892s">Do</a> you want me to, let me message her and see.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=258.484s">She</a> said she may have to hop off to take an important call, but she was going to hop on shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=267.528s">So</a> I don't know if we just want to get started and we can bring her into the attendance when she arrives. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=275.671s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=276.451s">I</a> wasn't sure.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=590.464s">So</a> our two scheduled meetings in June are, um, June 5th and June 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=594.668s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=595.957s">Um,</a> and the other thing that we need to add to the timeline is that we would need to vote in a, um, regularly scheduled school committee meeting to accept like anything that comes out of a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=611.345s">So,</a> um, the committee of the whole would have to happen or we would need to call a special school committee meeting late in the month to simply adopt what comes out of the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=623.411s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=625.505s">I</a> think it would be ideal if the committee of the whole could occur before the 12th, because then we could not be trying to sort of shove another meeting into the calendar in June, given all that goes on in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=640.337s">But</a> I think that does present some questions about the timeline and when it's reasonable to start this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=650.426s">Because</a> if you back up from there, like we're probably, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=653.927s">starting</a> to work at the beginning of May for the superintendent to be saying to us, like, this is what I've accomplished this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=660.71s">And</a> I starting at the beginning of May is pretty early.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=808.581s">We</a> can have another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=810.563s">Um,</a> the problem with that is there's going to be other reasons to have other meetings in June around the budget and like graduation and all the other things superintendent, if you want to play.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1280.092s">Yeah,</a> we vote on it, yeah.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1291.112s">Yeah,</a> I was just trying to, like, work through the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1295.914s">So</a> if we're trying to, like, be able to make our vote on the 12th, we could, working backwards, right, have a committee of the whole prior to our 6-5 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1305.759s">So</a> we could do our committee of the whole from, like, whatever it is, 5-6 or 5-30 to 6-30. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1309.681s">And</a> then I think <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1314.488s">working</a> backwards, like we, this committee, I think we need two weeks to be able to like take all the data and like work through this process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1324.615s">So</a> that would mean like everybody would have to give us their responses by 521, which is a Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1330.98s">And</a> if you back up two weeks from that, like the superintendent would present her evidence, like somewhere around the eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1338.885s">And</a> that would give us two weeks from that time, like, and we would distribute the template that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1344.76s">Because</a> we shouldn't be doing an evaluation before the superintendent has presented her evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1349.482s">So</a> if we like looked at 5A as like the jumping off point, I just haven't looked at where the meeting's at.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1489.683s">Well,</a> I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1494.932s">I</a> think I have an idea in my mind how the template could be laid out.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1501.314s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1504.855s">I</a> mean, it's just like the description and then the boxes, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1514.097s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1515.697s">I</a> think the bigger question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1519.074s">to</a> build it in such a way that it is not like many, many, many hours of manually intensive work on the backend. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1526.278s">And</a> I think I know how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1530.42s">So</a> I'd be happy like prior to whatever this meeting is to like take a shot at putting something together to bring and show you all what I'm thinking.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1546.28s">Yeah,</a> I wouldn't wanna use this one because it's a PDF and you can't copy and paste. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1553.202s">It</a> will need to be in a Google Doc of some kind to be easy, but the whole thing can be just replicated into a Google Doc, which is fun.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1647.358s">I</a> guess I would just do that at the meeting on the 8th because it would be a committee of the whole so everyone would be there the superintendent could present her evidence and then we could walk through how to use the template.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1663.55s">I</a> mean, a committee of the whole could be any amount of time we think we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1669.554s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1670.035s">So,</a> and I think that's a day, let me listen to the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1673.937s">Um,</a> I think that's a day where we don't have a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1678.12s">We</a> don't have a scheduled meeting that Monday, so we could just do this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1786.885s">Um,</a> I think we can just propose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1791.506s">Um,</a> I don't think scheduling requires a vote, but I think the superintendent will need to work with the mayor, the mayor to, to confirm that these dates work.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1888.732s">We're</a> going to share this document.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1978.508s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1980.669s">And</a> I would say it doesn't have to be <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1982.532s">Monday,</a> but there is no school committee meeting that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1986.634s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1986.894s">So</a> that would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1990.995s">That</a> works for me if we want to do it on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=1993.916s">Yeah,</a> that works for me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2130.149s">Yeah,</a> I'm happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2131.19s">I</a> mean, I don't remember if you were planning to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2173.516s">I</a> actually don't think you can do that because the open meeting law prohibits deliberation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2280.392s">I</a> guess I think the value of the template is the compilation <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2284.187s">And</a> I wouldn't expect SD to have a template because everybody chooses like different ways to compile. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2291.372s">So</a> I think that it's, to me, it's not about the form that you fill out so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2295.655s">It's</a> about like, does that form translate easily into compilation? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2300.599s">So</a> maybe they do, but I didn't get that sense when we did the training.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2435.672s">We</a> don't have a regular meeting scheduled, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2977.191s">I</a> think well I had a question and then a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2981.453s">So</a> my question is <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=2982.775s">Can</a> you remind me what the actual indicator that we picked was?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3024.249s">I</a> guess my comment is maybe more broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3029.791s">I</a> guess I could see how student feedback would fit in there, but to the points being made like that is like getting <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3038.138s">feedback</a> to check a box is not what I think we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3040.919s">And</a> to get good, authentic, like meaningful feedback is not something that can happen very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3047.321s">But</a> I guess I would also say that I don't feel particularly inclined to be prescriptive about what evidence the superintendent brings forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3057.504s">Like</a> she is the expert in this space and it's sort of up to her, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3065.07s">to</a> decide what the things are, right, that are gonna demonstrate her work and her performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3071.591s">And</a> I think if there's something particular that we definitely wanna see, that's fine, but I actually am not super inclined to like be prescriptive about this because I just think like evidence can come in all different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3088.294s">And</a> frankly, the superintendent is the expert, not the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5QCkkd08i8&t=3094.69s">We</a> sort of defer to her judgment about what those things are.<h2><a href="../2023-02-06_BSAjmRA8UYk/2023-02-06_BSAjmRA8UYk.html">MSC - Committee of the Whole - School Committee Goals</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=219.61s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=221.43s">I</a> think in the same vein of establishing <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=228.098s">a</a> better process for the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=231.359s">Like</a> I see part of that work being like writing down what we did so that the committee is not constantly reinventing the wheel around what we're doing and how we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=243.003s">Um,</a> especially, you know, there is an election coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=246.724s">There's</a> nothing to say that all of us will still be here in our seats a year from today. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=253.309s">And</a> I think when you think about onboarding new people to the school committee, it's a really daunting task. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=259.212s">So,</a> you know, in the same vein of putting some structure and process around the superintendent's evaluation, I think putting some thought into like, what would onboarding for new school committee members look like, <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=277.333s">We've</a> all sort of been through it in our own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=279.616s">But</a> I think nobody has had the same experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=283.081s">And</a> we actually started to identify some rules around that in our rules handbook last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=288.648s">So</a> I think we should <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=290.672s">You</a> know, maybe spend some time revisiting like what those rules were particular to onboarding school committee members and really think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=298.377s">Whether</a> they're sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=301.219s">Because</a> we haven't had to we haven't had to use them, but we also were trying to adopt like 100 rules at the same time so. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=308.58s">maybe</a> there's an opportunity to say, if we're just going to look at that set of subset of rules, like, is it enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=313.926s">Is</a> there adequate training around the open meeting law and Robert's rules of order? <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=317.89s">And</a> if there isn't, can we figure out what we want to do in those regards? <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=321.633s">So</a> I think from a like functioning of the school committee, that would be something that is on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=328.981s">But</a> I think, you know, to the point of, <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=333.032s">district</a> goals or goals of things that we as a school committee have purview over. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=338.584s">I</a> have a list of things that I <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=341.88s">want</a> to see us think about including an earlier budget process that is not us jamming five meetings into a week and a half at the last possible minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=354.007s">I</a> think it's really unfair to the community when we do those things because it really requires for anyone who wants to pay attention for them to drop everything, reschedule their lives and engage, which is just very hard to do when it gets to be May and into June <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=371.152s">So</a> that's one thing that's on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=374.095s">Again,</a> in terms of things we can control from a school committee perspective, a couple of other things I'm thinking about are having an actual debrief about our negotiations in terms of reflecting back on the process that we went through and starting to think for ourselves what we would do differently next time, whatever that might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=398.81s">I</a> think we need to talk about replacing our assistant superintendents of finance and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=403.912s">Um,</a> and then if I think about things that really, I didn't hear what you said on the last replacing our assistant superintendent of finance and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=412.816s">Um,</a> and then if I think about things that impact kids, which I think is, you know, it's easy to sort of sit here amongst adults and, um, talk about a lot of things that impact adults without talking about things that impact kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=428.673s">But</a> I think a couple of things that come to my mind is, as we've talked about before, does our administrative organization structure support students and teachers adequately? <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=438.579s">That's</a> a question we've asked and really not answered in a variety of ways over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=446.043s">And</a> the other big thing that I think we have coming up and looming in addition to our MSBA application is our bus contract and really thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=456.63s">expansion</a> of our bus service and eventually potentially being able to not be so reliant on the mpta. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=465.456s">All</a> of those things start with a procurement that sort of outlines what those goals are so we are not locked into a set number of buses that can't meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=476.863s">I</a> think some strategic thinking around that is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=481.706s">And</a> I think the other <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=484.63s">the</a> other conversation that is a continuing one that is hard to a hard nut to crack is the, you know, expansion or, or lack of expansion of the afterschool program and whether there are additional things we can be trying there. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=496.252s">So</a> I think there's like sort of two buckets for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=499.253s">One</a> is about our structure and our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=502.933s">And</a> the other is about like things that actually impact kids in the district and what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=509.035s">So</a> those are some of the things that I'm thinking about and, <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=511.903s">if</a> we're going to take like a six month view, like almost none of those things can be done in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=517.087s">So</a> it's, you know, I think we'd have to decide on what that term is, like what that length of time is before, um, we decide what the goals are and then, you know, figure out like, I think there's always 99 things to do and how do we come up with like the right number of things that we're going to say are our focus, um, so that we can clearly communicate that, uh, to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=540.712s">people</a> who come to meetings, to the people who don't come to meetings, and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=545.773s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=546.333s">Thank</a> you, member Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1258.509s">I</a> was going to say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1259.709s">I</a> mean, we are here together as a group through December. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1265.331s">So</a> I think it makes sense for us to identify what we think we can reasonably accomplish as a group of electeds before those electeds change.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1600.427s">I</a> would like to make a motion that we look at our goals timeline to conclude on november 30 so there is the month of december for us to do that evaluation reflection and perhaps <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1622.075s">sending</a> some information forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1626.059s">So</a> I'd like the idea of the timeline officially concluding in November so that we then can use December to sort of tidy things up for the next committee, whoever they are when they come in.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2851.472s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2852.152s">So</a> if that's the case, then School Brains now has the capability to <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2858.935s">like</a> display for parents what's happening with their student day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2862.517s">That's</a> great news because that didn't exist like a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2869.06s">And</a> then we're also gonna use taught, we're asking teachers to record it in one system and then use talking points to like communicate about it in another system. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2879.284s">And</a> then also a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2880.925s">So</a> I think that just sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2884.58s">exactly</a> something where nothing is ever going to happen the way parents are, I think, really asking the district to communicate about. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2891.923s">I</a> think it would be my very strong preference that we use our student information system for the capabilities that it must have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2902.327s">I</a> can't imagine that this system that is used across the state, across the country, cannot send emails proactively to parents when a referral is flagged in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2912.54s">beyond</a> my comprehension that a system in this day and age would not be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2917.367s">That</a> is so widely deployed like we're not using something we built, you know, in a, in a lab somewhere, you know, in the back office like we're using a purchased <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2929.21s">off</a> the shelf software platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2932.411s">It</a> has to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2933.932s">And</a> if it can do that, I don't know why we would create a form that is outside of that, because that is just like another place for the process to fall apart, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2946.348s">And</a> I think like if we're using talking points to have a conversation that makes sense, but I don't want it to be expected that as a teacher, I'm going to put information in a whole bunch of different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2959.617s">And</a> I'm going to communicate with parents because something is going to give that's going to bring us right back to where we are, which is wildly inconsistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2967.343s">So</a> I would rather see there be a standard way for <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2972.216s">Once</a> information goes into school brains, it can be communicated to parents and then teachers can use talking points to have the conversations that they should be having. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2981.399s">I</a> don't love this extra form. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2983.56s">I</a> think it's adding a lot of weird complexity about like, when do I put it in school brains? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2988.581s">And</a> when do I use the form? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2989.702s">And</a> I don't think any, I don't think parents wanna make this harder for school to communicate with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2996.484s">I</a> think we just like are really looking for basic like, <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3000.998s">flow</a> of information between what is happening in the building that we cannot see when we're at home or at work or wherever, and what you all know to be true and happening in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3013.984s">I</a> think we all would love for our kids to come home and tell us all these things, but they're not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3020.248s">And</a> we need you to tell us these things <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3023.524s">So</a> I am not like I am not in love with this form. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3027.306s">I</a> think it's basically one of those things that is going to completely fall by the wayside in three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3033.89s">I</a> would much rather see us invest some energy into actually learning what school brains does and doesn't do and can and cannot do. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3041.294s">Because</a> if we didn't know about this, what else don't we know about? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3044.556s">I</a> do think it's appropriate if those things are being tracked or could be tracked for six to eight that <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3050.658s">Again,</a> that could absolutely happen in school brains that doesn't seem like it would be too big of a stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3056.842s">And</a> I think I have always had the question about if we are putting student data in school brains about elementary students, why can parents not see that data? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3065.567s">Like</a> whatever it may be, and there may be great reasons to not put this kind of disciplinary data in there, but if you're keeping data about my kid in a system, I want access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3076.331s">because</a> it's my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3078.052s">So</a> I thought during the pandemic, we might have opened that up and that didn't happen, but I think parents are capable of understanding that there are differences between levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3089.876s">So</a> I would also ask that the district like end that practice of storing data in a system about kids that is not visible to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3097.579s">Like</a> I think, and to member McLaughlin's point, like a quick video on a website and more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3104.778s">principles</a> talking about, like, this is how we do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3108.12s">This</a> is what our community does. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3109.981s">This</a> is what our culture and our school operation is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3114.423s">That's</a> what is missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3115.824s">So,</a> like, if we're trying to get at that consistency and that community climate expectations, like, I don't think the form actually gets us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3125.99s">I'm</a> not tied to the form at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3127.491s">And</a> if we throw the form out and we do something better, all the better if it is easier and more likely to <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3134.378s">A,</a> succeed, and B, be around next year at this time, and D, actually make things easier for the people who are having to do this work, because I'm really concerned about that too.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3259.761s">Yeah,</a> and I think that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3261.783s">And</a> I think immediate is not always the right answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3266.247s">Like,</a> you know, maybe it's like a weekly thing or daily thing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3271.326s">But</a> I just want to make s consistent that we can sa do this thing in our dist you can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3276.168s">I</a> definit that to take the place of any level because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3287.148s">and</a> hear from humans what's happening with their tiny humans, however tiny or giant they might be like they need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3294.951s">So</a> I don't I think you're right like that has to be a priority and if we push too much paper around like that's going to that's the thing that will get lost and and no one will be better for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3306.667s">And</a> I think to the point of like these information management systems being really complicated, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3314.049s">Like</a> every time you kind of peel back a layer, right, there's something else there about how the system operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3320.411s">And</a> if we, you know, feel like this is just one of those situations where we need to be in better contact with those experts so that we can do the things we want to do, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3329.354s">If</a> we feel like this system cannot meet our needs, like there are other ones out there and we should use our <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3335.922s">our</a> money to buy a new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3338.704s">Like</a> we just, we shouldn't keep being satisfied with systems that can't meet our needs that create like a huge administrative burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3347.01s">So</a> I'm open to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3347.951s">I</a> don't think necessarily that has to be the answer, but I think, you know, we have a platform and we probably in all fairness and through no criticism, like never learned how it ticked or how to use it in a really <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3365.902s">Deepway,</a> and we lost a registrar a few years back to budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3372.123s">So</a> there's 100 reasons why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3374.244s">I</a> just want to make sure that if we're saying the system can't do something, somebody needs to ask, are we sure? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3381.085s">Because</a> I think we just found out that we're not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3386.646s">And</a> those are important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3388.086s">These</a> systems evolve, and they change, and they're constantly getting features added. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3392.507s">So</a> I think that kind of conversation and dialogue is always really important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7478.76s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7479.26s">Yeah,</a> just a quick note to let folks know that we obviously talked about this last week in our committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7487.862s">We</a> just wanted to make sure that this motion formally came on the floor, which is part of our rules and procedures around sending things to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7497.505s">And</a> we have a tentative meeting date in mid-February that we're already working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7502.926s">So</a> hoping we will <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7505.776s">pass</a> this and we can get to work.<h2><a href="../2023-02-09_43e2jY84pIA/2023-02-09_43e2jY84pIA.html">Strategic Planning Subcommittee - 02.01.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=0.098s">Thursday,</a> February 29th, 2023 from 430 to 530, a strategic planning subcommittee meeting will be held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=8.526s">The</a> purpose of the strategic planning subcommittee meeting is to draft a naming policy for facilities in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=14.071s">Additionally,</a> a strategic planning subcommittee will discuss community participation slash contribution options for the Numa Glenn Elementary Playground to provide a recommendation to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=23.865s">This</a> meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 at 430. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=32.007s">Since</a> this meeting is held remotely, participants can call or log in by using the following link and call in number. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=38.168s">One</a> phone number to call in is 929-205-6099. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=39.588s">Enter</a> the meeting ID 940-9894-1899. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=50.615s">Additionally,</a> questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at Medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=58.637s">And</a> there's no dot in between Jenny and Graham, just for those who might want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=63.958s">Submissions</a> must include the filing, your first and last name, your Medford street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=68.539s">So</a> we have two items on our agenda today, but first I'm going to call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=75.021s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=78.422s">Member</a> Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=80.182s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=81.659s">and</a> member Graham present. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=83.12s">So</a> three present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=86.661s">So</a> we do have two items on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=90.003s">And</a> the first is to draft a naming policy for facilities within Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=96.285s">Sort</a> of, I think I'm thinking of that more as the overarching work so that we have a policy around how this works in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=103.368s">And</a> then the second is to have some discussion around whether the school committee wants <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=110.578s">the</a> playground effort to pursue some sort of community participation or contribution options and what that might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=118.803s">And</a> I'm thinking of that more as a matter of urgency since we don't have a policy in place that we need to give some thought to that so that that can move forward in one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=132.551s">So</a> the first item is to draft a naming policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=139.034s">I</a> have actually <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=140.687s">taken</a> a shot at making a draft so that we have a jumping off point. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=147.492s">I</a> am not tied to any of it in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=151.736s">And</a> I know that none of you have seen it because we can't share these things ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=158.021s">Because</a> the open meeting law prohibits that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=161.083s">But</a> I do have it here and I can share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=164.466s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=166.293s">I'm</a> thinking that maybe reading through the whole thing first, um, would be the right approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=174.595s">And</a> then we can go back, um, section by section and talk about comments, changes, suggestions, that kind of thing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=205.214s">So,</a> I want to thank the Belmont School Committee for giving me a nice jumping off point that I was able to use in the creation of this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=219.398s">I'll</a> just read it from top to bottom and then we can go section by section. <a

<a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=424.88s">It</a> should offer appropriate background information on the person or organization in the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=429.822s">Number</a> two, the school committee will consider the request and invite public input at two consecutive meetings before a vote to approve or deny the request is taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=438.818s">Uh,</a> the school committee may choose to send their request to a naming advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=443.94s">Uh,</a> and then final section, um, for a community giving program where donors will be invited to give to a project in exchange for a physical dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=453.143s">So,</a> um, for example, a brick with the donor name on it, the program rules and required donation levels will be placed on the regular school committee agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=461.146s">The</a> item should describe the program placement of physical dedications, donor levels, and other rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=465.905s">The</a> committee will consider the request and invite public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=469.786s">The</a> school committee may make a decision at any time provided that public input was received prior, sorry, before the vote of approval or denial.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=608.36s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=609.44s">As</a> I wrote this, I thought about these four different buckets, I guess I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=615.383s">If</a> you're going to rename a whole school building, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=620.132s">That</a> or name, uh, either right name or rename, um, uh, a whole building, um, that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=626.658s">Seems</a> to, at least in my mind, rise to the level of some sort of advisory committee around what that name should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=633.244s">But</a> I think there also are times and we want to provide space for the large donor who wants to donate a hundred million dollars to build Medford high. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=642.131s">Like,</a> I think we should have a process too. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=644.57s">accepting</a> money graciously and think about that, you know, in its own structure, which, you know, I think is a little bit different than that sort of a naming situation without a financial donation associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=660.22s">And</a> that, but I also know, I also know that we have named classrooms in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=666.304s">Like</a> I know that there's one or two classrooms that have been named in honor of past school committee members and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=673.394s">didn't</a> seem to necessarily rise to the level of a naming committee, but instead something that the administration might bring forward to us or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=683.277s">And</a> then that final piece of like, how do we allow for community participation in projects like what we have coming up with the McGlynn playground? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=696.38s">What</a> does that look like and how would it work? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=700.061s">So</a> that, those are the four buckets, which is, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=702.663s">Um,</a> you know, Belmont, I think had maybe two of these buckets, but as I thought through it, um, I thought this really covered all the bases around naming. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=710.287s">Um,</a> so I don't know, uh, superintendent or Joan or Dr. Cushing, if any of you have any comments, um, that you'd like to share.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=813.793s">Yeah,</a> I think a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=816.257s">if</a> there were such a situation where we had like, you know, many things up for naming, for example, like there were 10 labs or something like that, that we decided we wanted to name. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=829.159s">I</a> think that would fall under this like community giving program where there's like some naming in exchange for like a fixed price, like much like what Medford public library just did. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=841.361s">And</a> so I think what the school committee would want to weigh in on is the appropriateness of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=846.308s">the</a> plan or the program that's being put out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=849.629s">Um,</a> and, um, and then like following those rule, like whatever those rules are, we would like consider those approve them and then move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=860.612s">I</a> think the other thing that, um, You know, when we talk about McGlynn specifically that I wanted to react to was there's been a lot of conversation in the community about how. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=871.395s">We</a> could name every piece of equipment on the McGlynn playground, much like we named all the chairs and everything else in the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=880.618s">And</a> the policy doesn't sort of like lean one way or another on that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=890.821s">I</a> think for me personally, like I do hesitate to sell off <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=900.501s">like</a> pieces of our kids' education in the same way that we sell off like public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=909.167s">I</a> know the schools are a public building, but I feel like there's higher purpose around what goes on in a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=918.093s">And</a> I think we're, you know, really aware and tuned into the idea that not everything is, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=929.077s">comfortable</a> for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=931.238s">And</a> when you start talking about naming classrooms, like, I feel like that sort of wanders into this territory of potentially creating discomfort for students that is avoidable. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=943.145s">So</a> I think for me, personally, like I don't love the idea of selling the like the soul of our school and let's sort of like extreme and maybe harsh, partially said, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=957.322s">But,</a> you know, and I sort of had that same like personal reaction when people talked about like naming all the pieces of equipment on the McGlynn playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=967.226s">With</a> that said, like, I do think it's great for the community to be able to participate in buying and feeling ownership over our school spaces, because I think that creates like a sense of pride and ownership and all those things are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=985.534s">The</a> policy doesn't say anything about that sort of intentionally, because I could see that being really different item to item in terms of how we would sort of consider and approach some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1001.404s">And</a> then we can talk about it specific to the movement playground once we feel like this policy makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1007.227s">So</a> I don't know, I remember, so I saw you have your hand in the air.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1121.715s">I'm</a> going to stop sharing for a minute because I think it makes it hard for people to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1124.818s">I</a> in fact missed whoever it was in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1129.723s">So</a> I do see we have a comment in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1132.865s">I</a> don't know if Paigey wants to provide their name and address in the chat or if you would like to speak.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1185.122s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1187.617s">One</a> thing that I did put in this policy that I want to call your attention to is if we're talking about the idea of a naming committee, there is, and this was, I believe this was in Belmont's policy as well, a final mention that the school committee will adopt a name by a majority vote and that the school committee is not required to accept the recommendation of the naming advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1213.937s">That</a> was in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1216.512s">um,</a> how we established, um, our last naming advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1221.616s">And</a> the reason for, uh, that to be there is not to say that, um, the school committee would want to like waste the time of the volunteers on a naming advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1234.927s">Um,</a> and then blatantly disregard their recommendations, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1242.258s">to</a> acknowledge that the responsibility of this does rest with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1245.98s">And</a> if for some reason the school committee felt like the outcome of the advisory committee was compromised or did not align with information that was available to the school committee, the school committee has the authority under the law and would be certainly able to make a different decision about the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1268.092s">So</a> that's why that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1269.252s">I</a> just wanted to call that to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1272.45s">Um,</a> and, um, if anyone, I don't know if any of the numbers have anything they want to say about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1524.915s">Can</a> you see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1532.716s">So,</a> I just made an adaption to this second sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1537.177s">It</a> says, while the school committee is not required to accept the recommendations of the Naming Advisory Committee, it looks forward to supporting those recommendations whenever possible.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1626.654s">It</a> actually does. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1628.274s">It</a> is outlined as one of the authorities of the school committee and national law. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1634.436s">So</a> that is, that is where it comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1637.408s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1708.315s">Well,</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1762.188s">Well,</a> I think the policy does say that <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1765.466s">that</a> the school committee at the opening, right, that has sole authority over naming and renaming buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1771.428s">So</a> I think this policy applies to both naming and renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1778.251s">And</a> so I think it is covered if for some reason we decided that we needed to rename a building, it would follow this same process, which would be like, if we're gonna, if it's a whole building, we would establish an advisory committee and then go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1796.327s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1799.13s">Any</a> other questions, thoughts, comments?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1847.457s">Do</a> I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1850.898s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1852.559s">Okay,</a> on the motion to approve as amended and bring it to <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1857.215s">The</a> next regular school committee meeting, we'll do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1861.896s">Member</a> Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1863.557s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1864.697s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1865.277s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1867.097s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1867.637s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1868.178s">So</a> three in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1874.099s">Superintendent,</a> because this is a new policy, it will need to go on the next agenda for our policy read and then <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1883.21s">Uh,</a> it will need to be read again at the following meeting because policies require two readings before they are adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1889.491s">So,</a> um, it it'll appear on the next two agendas in some form or another February 27th and March 6th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1900.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1902.413s">Um,</a> item number two on the agenda, I'm going to stop sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1905.574s">Um,</a> item number two on the agenda is to talk about, um, any community participation <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1912.34s">program</a> we might want to implement for the McGlynn playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1919.806s">So</a> if you all remember, we saw a design, um, of the McGlynn playground, um, the design right now, I believe, don't believe had any like particular spaces for like pavers or bricks or anything like that, um, explicitly drawn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1937.815s">Um,</a> however, I think the feedback that we got, um, over the course of time was that, that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1943.919s">Those</a> could be sort of built in or drawn into the plan quite easily if the committee wished to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1950.303s">Um,</a> and as I mentioned at the top of the meeting, there's been, you know, for a bit of discussion about how we could name all of the equipment, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1959.948s">Um,</a> there's big. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1962.997s">My</a> idea around the report out of this meeting would be to sort of provide for discussion to the group a summary of the discussion we have here and put a resolution on the agenda that describes a possible answer to what we want to do with the McGlynn playground, given that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1990.983s">this</a> policy isn't quite adopted and we do need to make some decisions quickly so that there would be a place on the agenda for us to talk about that as a broader committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=1998.666s">But</a> my hope was that we could have some discussion here around what we might recommend to sort of inform that resolution that I'm happy to put on the agenda once we are done here for broader discussion with the group.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2284.905s">You</a> know, I've personally done some thinking about this because I was on the playground committee and this has obviously come up a couple of different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2293.008s">And</a> I think two things that seemed <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2296.823s">that</a> sort of seemed like they might be reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2303.646s">One</a> would be to allow folks to donate a brick for some like reasonable amount of money with like the goal, back to the goal being community participation in this playground that we want the community to be really proud of and to use and to take care of and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2321.835s">So</a> that's like one, I think possible thing that doesn't feel oppressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2326.953s">Um,</a> the other thing that, um, I thought about was that we could invite larger donors, um, to support the program and put some sort of like commemorative plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2346.584s">Like</a> at the outside of the playground, cause it will be sort of gated off. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2351.207s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2351.567s">So,</a> and that plaque could contain. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2354.91s">Like</a> the names of the playground committee that contributed to the, to the work in the build. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2359.533s">And</a> it could also thank significant donors, like, you know, at some threshold, like if somebody wants to donate $10,000, like we would agree to put their name on the plaque or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2370.96s">So</a> that there's a place to say thank you for the people who, um, or the, or the organizations who did want to make a significant donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2380.426s">Um,</a> and maybe there could be like, I don't know, sponsors and <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2384.542s">silver</a> sponsors and bronze sponsors, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2387.585s">And</a> that, but it would be a place that is sort of independent of the play space that kids are gonna be like sort of running and romping around. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2397.654s">So</a> appropriate commemoration, but stopping short of like a plaque at every piece of equipment that's been sold off because that doesn't feel appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2409.78s">as</a> palatable for me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2411.181s">So</a> that's some of the thinking that I've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2413.001s">I</a> don't know, member Hays, if you have any thoughts about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2516.818s">Actually,</a> I think that's a really great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2521.942s">And</a> I liked the idea of, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2524.925s">some</a> sort of public art installation sort of maybe instead of like bricks with people's names on them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2536.413s">So</a> that there's some way, and I think we would have to talk with the architects about that, but maybe there is some way to create some sort of public art component to the playground instead of bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2554.845s">which</a> break and do what breaks do. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2557.727s">So</a> member Rizzo.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=2944.158s">Dr.</a> Cushing, it's still possible to ask the architects to think about like an art installation space, is that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3068.516s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3069.596s">Dr.</a> Hortensen?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3195.754s">So</a> I am, as I'm listening to everybody's comments, I'm wondering if our recommendation to the school committee is that we invite donors to donate and plan for a plaque that recognizes them. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3211.979s">And</a> maybe we come up with like a gold, silver, bronze sort of sponsorship level, or maybe we come up with more playground oriented names for those levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3224.328s">And</a> which I think might be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3227.309s">Um,</a> so maybe we could, uh, think through that, um, and, um, encourage, you know, those donations, you know, and note that, um, we'll have a commemorative plaque that would, you know, identify them on the plaque and, um, leave it at that for, for our recommendation for the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3251.893s">I</a> think. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3252.825s">you</a> know, to Dr. Cushing's point, like rounding off the playground to make sure that like it has bike racks and, you know, all, you know, all the like little things that add up, um, or if we are able to, you know, raise some more money, we probably could plant more mature trees than what the trees are that we're going to be able to plan under the, under the basic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3273.252s">So</a> some of those things, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3276.893s">Make</a> it make sense for us to go ahead and try to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3281.992s">raise</a> money, I think there's also going to be some disruption during the building of the playground where we're going to need to provide some equipment for students so that they have adequate play access while the playground is under construction that costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3298.241s">I</a> don't believe that's in the estimate, Dr. Cushing, but I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3302.703s">So</a> there are reasons to raise money beyond the sort of estimate that <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3309.349s">The</a> city has committed to, and they it's, it's amazing that the city has committed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3315.451s">And</a> I'm always reminded in these moments that sometimes out of really terrible things like COVID come things like ARPA money and new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3327.034s">So,</a> um, hopefully, um, that holds, um, particularly as construction costs rise, but I, I. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3336.565s">That's</a> sort of where I'm at in terms of the conversation I've just heard is, do we establish some levels and promise plaque that would provide us the sort of space and the leeway to round out the playground and put out that call for public schools, from the superintendent's office to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3362.674s">So</a> I don't know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3378.866s">Are</a> there any thoughts about those threshold levels that we would? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3385.571s">I</a> mean, I think if you're going to put everybody on a plaque, it could be very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3389.673s">If</a> any dollar amount <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3395.257s">ends</a> up on the plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3395.998s">I</a> don't know if we have any immediate thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3398.42s">I'm</a> also happy just to put a draft out there and see what the committee thinks about it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3404.084s">I</a> know it is 5.30 and we're at our meeting time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3524.725s">Um,</a> I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3527.166s">So</a> I think, um, this conversation obviously like in the minutes, um, and in the description of, um, The, um, the readout of the subcommittee meeting will sort of provide people some of the things that we've already thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3544.578s">I</a> will put, um, an agenda item on a resolution on that lays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3552.565s">some</a> idea of what that set of thresholds might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3555.586s">I'll</a> actually take a look around and see what others have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3558.747s">And</a> then we can wordsmith it and all of that good stuff with the larger committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3566.63s">So</a> I don't think we need to take a vote on any of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3574.252s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3577.514s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3578.714s">Motion</a> adjourned by member Hays, seconded by member So. <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3582.584s">Roll</a> call, member Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3584.285s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43e2jY84pIA&t=3585.446s">Member</a> Ruseau?<h2><a href="../2023-02-01_e2JGoC251eM/2023-02-01_e2JGoC251eM.html">Medford School Committee of the Whole - Superintendent Goals - 02.01.2023</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=235.48s">So</a> I just want to make sure I understand what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=244.506s">We</a> are identifying the one or two focus indicators for
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=260.14s">Is</a> that what we should be thinking about thinking through right now?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=404.144s">I</a> tried to print the document that you sent superintendent and it's a mess of a document. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=410.787s">Like</a> it doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=412.589s">I</a> don't know what happened when they convert, when Jesse converted it to a PDF, but like the words roll off the page. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=418.894s">Like</a> I, it's, it's sort of a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=423.177s">So</a> I actually was like wanting to read through that, but I, it just is like sort of impossible to use the way that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=434.125s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=435.306s">I</a> don't think there's anything you can do about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=437.808s">That's</a> on the Jesse website, but.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=500.05s">uh</a> you know we like to have lots of documents and these things and like this is one I'm on the DESE website and it's just a document about the standards and the standards are exactly the same yeah as the ones in Sharon's document so even though there is a discrepancy in the date like the the standards themselves are exactly the same <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=528.49s">They're</a> the same number, they're the same title. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=532.473s">It</a> doesn't look like anything has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=534.614s">So</a> I think wherever you look, the choices in each bucket are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=542.299s">So</a> that's, I guess, good.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=663.549s">I</a> have a printout of what those were that Maurice sent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=667.811s">So</a> we have a, like three pages, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=670.772s">The</a> district improvement goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=673.337s">an</a> early literacy goal for student learning and then professional practice goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=678.439s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=680.62s">So</a> I like before the meeting, I went through and looked at what those were and then looked at the indicator possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=691.285s">And</a> I made some notes about what I think sort of aligns the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=696.707s">They</a> need to be aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=697.868s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=698.648s">So</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=701.109s">Like</a> for example, like in instructional leadership, the two that stood out to me as like the most aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=707.514s">So</a> Melanie, if you scroll down a little bit to that next section.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=730.109s">I</a> think just at the bottom of this page, I think, right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=733.591s">So</a> in that left column there under instructional leadership, the two that stood out to me as like the most aligned to the overall goals were accepted.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=805.457s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=805.897s">Okay,</a> so I think for everyone who's watching, <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=810.242s">for</a> context, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=811.242s">The</a> school committee is responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=813.923s">One</a> of our chief responsibilities is to hire and evaluate the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=817.663s">So</a> that evaluation process is quite prescriptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=822.064s">Um,</a> that comes from Jesse. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=823.504s">So</a> we can, you know, I think on some level we could do anything we wanted, but ultimately it has to fit into a particular structure in order for us to be able to submit our <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=838.768s">our</a> annual evaluation to DESTI on behalf of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=843.55s">And</a> so as we've done all the years that I've been on, the superintendent presented earlier this year, a set of goals that covers three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=854.954s">One</a> is a district improvement goal, one is a student learning goal, and one is a professional practice goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=861.576s">And</a> so earlier this year, like maybe end of September, Dr. Edouard-Vincent presented to us <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=868.57s">Um,</a> a document that lists those goals and like what the key actions are related to the goals and what the outcomes would, might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=878.772s">Um,</a> if she has achieved those goals and we approved that unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=883.893s">Either</a> at the end of September or at the beginning of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=887.794s">Um,</a> we subsequently had, uh, a retreat with somebody from the Massachusetts association of school committees to connect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=897.722s">to</a> this like very long set of indicators that DESI asks us to weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=907.611s">So</a> they are in addition to the goals that we have already approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=913.096s">And</a> the change for us in terms of how we are doing this to align with the newest latest version of what DESI is asking us to do is to <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=923.539s">Instead</a> of evaluating the superintendent on each and every one of these rubrics, we are being asked to evaluate, to identify a subset of all of these indicators across four categories that are the ones we want to see focus on this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=946.09s">And</a> the ideal is that they align with what the goals are that we've already approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=953.598s">This</a> meeting is really to say we did not do that piece of work when we approved the goals initially, because we hadn't yet like connected those two things the way that Dessie is connecting them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=966.182s">Um,</a> and so we need to go through and up this, um, the top of the screen there, you can see those four columns. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=973.183s">It's</a> our collective job to reach consensus on which of the one or two indicators in each column. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=983.174s">do</a> we believe are the ones that we will focus on and evaluate the superintendent on? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=988.157s">All</a> of those things obviously are things the superintendent's generally expected to do in any given year, but from an evaluation perspective, the goal is to make sure that we are evaluating the superintendent in a way that is focused on what the district's goals are, and that's sort of reflected in the superintendent's goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1010.789s">So</a> the first thing that we need to do <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1013.451s">Um,</a> is go through these indicators and determine in each column, there has to be at least one, but the recommendation is that there are no more than two, um, which ones we are going to evaluate based on when we do a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1029.616s">Later</a> this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1030.336s">So</a> I think fast forward to next year, we would do all of this at the time that we, um, go ahead and identify what the goals are for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1040.803s">So</a> this step, this interim step that we're taking next year will be done sort of all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1047.446s">We</a> just hadn't, as a committee, as a collective, gone through this together to sort of link up the changes that DESE has made in the past year or two with what our process has been over these last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1061.874s">So</a> the first thing on our agenda is to decide which of these things most closely aligned with what the goals are that <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1071.139s">we've</a> already approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1072.16s">So</a> we're not opening up the floor to rehash goals, but instead to say which of these things match those goals that we've already asked the superintendent to work on, and it is halfway through the year, so she's already working on those things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1433.174s">I</a> actually only had A selected here. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1436.515s">Like</a> when I read through B, I felt like it was trying to get at something that arguably like we need to get to as a district, but didn't totally line up with the specific details of what we're asking the superintendent to focus on this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1456.209s">I</a> totally agree on A. And I think that's really important given like the focus, you know, actually the alignment of the goals that we have and some of the immediate focus that we have, particularly at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1470.872s">But</a> B didn't totally line up for me exactly the way A did. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1477.093s">So,</a> but I could be swayed either way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1598.362s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1602.144s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1603.184s">I</a> think the other thing, I'm a proponent for just the one in this category, mostly because <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1609.884s">When</a> we get to the next category, which is really, really aligned with what the superintendent's goals are, I thought they all applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1617.531s">So</a> if we're trying to stick to six or eight, like going with one here might make some more sense because that would give us a little bit more freedom to be focused on the communications, the family and community engagement component. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1633.225s">So</a> that was my other thought is like, <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1636.459s">I</a> think it's important for us to. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1637.259s">Go</a> sort of slim here and be focused on those other things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1886.423s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1888.464s">Yes,</a> Member Grim. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1890.765s">If</a> I had to prioritize like one of these, it would be, especially since we dropped family concerns out of the last category, I think for me, it would be managing conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1903.294s">because</a> I think that ties nicely with all the other communication goals and the challenges with climate and culture that we have right now and with the superintendent's overall district improvement goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1920.108s">So</a> for me, that one jumps out as perhaps the most pressing thing that hasn't already been covered elsewhere.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2202.972s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2204.353s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2205.694s">I</a> think I think the committee could work provided that like at least in terms of like the ranking evaluation that somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2218.132s">takes</a> on like the compilation of that component of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2222.333s">And</a> that the focus of the committee is like weeding through everybody's comments and writing like a cohesive comment about like that compiles everybody's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2238.515s">Because</a> I think that's one thing we haven't totally done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2243.376s">Like</a> I think we've tried to present everybody's <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2248.086s">points</a> of view, and I think that's important, but I think what we heard in our session is like, the goal is really to have a cohesive story that comes out of this evaluation that the superintendent can act on. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2260.492s">So</a> I guess, like, I, I can see how we, like, I could see a format in my head about the, the like ranking part, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2270.157s">So</a> whether it's neat or proficient or exemplary, whatever, whatever those categories are to show like a distribution <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2278.01s">of,</a> um, how the individual committee numbers sort of landed on each of those indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2284.052s">And,</a> but then once you see that distribution, like there could be, you know, one person who thinks one, two people who think two and four people who think three, like, I think it would be ideal if then the committee, the subcommittee could look at that and say, the recommendation is three, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2306.255s">And</a> the recommendation is like of all of these comments, which are public record anyway, like this is what we recommend the comment to be so that the output of the committee is like a recommendation about how to take the distribution of everybody's scores to like one, one measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2324.14s">And</a> then a cohesive narrative, um, that becomes the review that then comes to committee of the whole, we all get a chance to like review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2334.898s">And</a> then we can vote to pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2337.14s">So</a> I'm wondering like, if that makes sense, I just think somebody is going to have to sit down and like do the number of mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2344.065s">I'm</a> happy to be that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2345.266s">Like</a> here's what the distribution is so that then the committee has something to act on. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2349.729s">Cause</a> I think if three people get in a room and try to create that together, it's, it's going to be really tedious for everybody, or I'd rather the focus of the work beyond like making the review sound cohesive in the end.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2596.664s">So</a> meaning that after the committee does its work it would hand over not just the recommendation but the raw like original documents from each member as well?<h2><a href="../2023-01-25_EzhtyjkzgTA/2023-01-25_EzhtyjkzgTA.html">State of the City Address - 01/25/23</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=834.198s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=835.646s">Thank</a> you Mayor Lungo-Koehn for asking me to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=838.308s">I</a> am honored to be here and to be the vice chair of the school committee and maybe more honored that the citizens of Medford have imparted their faith on me for nearly four years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=847.383s">which</a> does feel like a small lifetime for these past four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=852.586s">When</a> I think about the year in review, it feels like every year in review that I think about since I joined the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=858.711s">And</a> so each year, the school committee works really hard with our school administration to make progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=864.554s">And</a> each year it's also abundantly clear that there's so much more progress that our students deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=870.739s">And</a> so when I think about that, I'm often overwhelmed, but I'm gonna start with some highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=877.643s">So</a> this past year, we invested in a lot of curricula at high quality curricula for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=882.944s">That's</a> long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=884.725s">This</a> includes textbooks for many high school courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=888.146s">It</a> includes a new math curriculum for our middle schoolers, and it includes a new math curriculum for our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=894.607s">We</a> also have continued at the elementary level to infuse phonics based curricula into our programming, into our literacy programming while we pursue <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=907.034s">a</a> fuller replacement of our literacy curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=910.237s">That</a> phonics-based approach is so clearly what the science tells us is the way to support all readers and change lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=918.063s">And</a> so I'm really grateful to the school administration for their tenacity as they have worked to really make a huge shift in the way that teaching and learning is happening at our elementary school level when we talk about the most fundamental thing, which is learning to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=933.672s">As</a> we look forward, I also am excited to see that we have assembled a group of Medford residents to take a look at our health curriculum and to make sure that in the future, our health curriculum is comprehensive, it's grounded in science and that it works to prevent bullying and violence in our student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=952.504s">The</a> team that we've assembled is truly amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=955.806s">They</a> are so credentialed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=957.087s">I</a> just like can't even believe that all this talent lives right <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=961.237s">take</a> care in this tiny little space that we call Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=965.031s">Beyond</a> all the good work that we are doing on the curriculum side, the other thing that we have spent a lot of time working through and I'm really proud of is the work we've done to bolster our mental health supports for students who are so clearly, as we all are, still thinking about navigating their way out of the pandemic and all the ways that it has affected them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=984.197s">So</a> I'm really pleased that we have been able to bolster those supports and the work that we're doing there is <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=992.16s">is</a> arduous and super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=998.585s">This</a> past year was a big one as we negotiated with our 11 bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1002.348s">We</a> have 11 labor unions within Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1006.312s">Through</a> that work, we thanked our teachers for their hard work during the pandemic and beyond, and in the aftermath of it for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1014.918s">And</a> we settled the most favorable contract <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1018.795s">in</a> decades for our teachers, perhaps ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1022.459s">We</a> also committed that our employees in Medford Public Schools deserve a living wage and we found a way to ensure that our paraprofessionals receive compensation that is not just a living wage, but an incredible step forward for our staff and the students they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1035.61s">We've</a> also settled contacts with nurses, our school secretaries and our carpenters. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1040.228s">And</a> we still have work to do to settle our remaining contracts, but we are committed to ensuring that our staff receives a living wage for the service that they provide to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1050.25s">I</a> want to thank the Community Preservation Commission for their ongoing support of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1055.452s">Most</a> recently, we were able to assemble an advisory committee to look at the replacement of the McGlynn Elementary School playground with their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1064.356s">The</a> design is stunning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1065.536s">It</a> recognizes that play is learning, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1071.419s">And</a> it is the first truly inclusive playground in the city of Medford, or will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1077.51s">The</a> advisory committee worked really diligently to ensure that we heard from a whole variety of stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1084.175s">We</a> heard from children, we heard from the teachers in the building, and we heard from the community because that space will be a community space as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1091.581s">And</a> we were able to come up with a design that centered sustainability, inclusivity, and fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1099.167s">Thanks</a> to the CPC for their ongoing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1102.07s">We</a> have commitments to fund construction and to the mayor for dedicating ARPA funds <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1107.169s">to</a> make that playground a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1109.291s">I</a> was proud to serve on that committee, on the advisory committee itself, along with school committee woman, Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1116.737s">And</a> I think it's safe to say the entire school committee can't wait to cut the ribbon on the finished playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1123.803s">Last</a> year has posed its share of challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1125.824s">I</a> am sure you've heard about them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1127.946s">And</a> I think it's safe to say that no school building has felt more challenged than Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1133.496s">We</a> took steps in these past few months to ensure that our high school is safe and conducive to learning for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1140.059s">Creating</a> a climate and culture that is deserving of Medford's pride is certainly a work in progress, and it's one that we're all committed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1147.922s">My</a> heart and my work go out to the families that have felt the pain that is our history, and it's because of those voices and because it's the right thing to do that we are taking a deep, hard look at what's going right, and more importantly, what needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1163.26s">I'm</a> committed to making those changes, no matter how hard they are, because our students deserve nothing less. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1171.184s">Finally,</a> our high school students also deserve a building that can support modern, cutting-edge education and has ample space for our vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1180.182s">I'm</a> proud of the application that we submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority this past year, and was disheartened to learn that we weren't invited to the next step, mainly due to skyrocketing costs in building projects, school building projects across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1194.873s">I'm</a> calling on our state delegation to do everything that they can to make sure that we increase funding at the state level to the MSBA next year and for the years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1204.5s">And</a> I'm excited to announce that we will resubmit our application in April, <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1208.574s">with</a> additions as outlined and recommended by the building authority, and that we will also begin discussions on what other options we may have and start to explore how we move forward in rebuilding or replacing Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1225.382s">I</a> also look forward to working with the mayor to make that re-imagined Medford High a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1231.145s">I'll</a> close by saying this, to all the millionaires and billionaires in the audience, <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1235.876s">If</a> you are wondering how to make an impact in the lives of people around you, call me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1241.461s">We</a> can talk about the impact a reimagined Medford High can have on our students and our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1249.508s">With</a> that, it is my pleasure to introduce my friend, Nicole Morell, who is the president of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1255.294s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_oefytL6ycdo/2025-06-26_oefytL6ycdo.html">Community

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6607.984s">Going</a> through the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6608.845s">So</a> I love when he goes first because he takes care of most of our lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6612.707s">But</a> I concur with all of Clayce's comments and suggestions for more information next time you come and see us. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6621.392s">I</a> would like to say I'm really excited that this type of project is being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6626.239s">for</a> Mystic Ave and I have followed your project in Chelsea and those plans are very, very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6635.803s">So</a> I am hopeful and positive of the type of building design that you can bring here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6641.706s">I</a> would just keep it brief in terms of where I'm particularly focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6647.989s">I</a> share concerns with those blank walls. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6652.18s">It</a> seems more inward facing to me and when you're looking at this being almost like the first really major development of this type in this area and what could come in the future, I think you need to think about it in that context and being more open and inviting to its surroundings. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6674.371s">I</a> am interested in the pedestrian level perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6677.852s">I'd</a> like to really see what that looks like at that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6680.575s">So</a> as you think about additional views and then also landscape and hardscape plan would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6689.375s">I</a> think activating that street level so it does have retail or more of a community access space is important rather than a conference room that may not always get used and tend to be empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6704.42s">If</a> you are trying to program it as community space that it's not really activated, it would just be unfortunate to have a space that is empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6712.463s">I</a> think that covers it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6719.858s">Yeah,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=6720.618s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=7934.914s">I</a> just had one that was more like just grammatical. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=7938.836s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=7940.857s">I</a> think where it talks about the configuration to get to the increased number of units, I think it really <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=7949.259s">should</a> be reconfiguration, it's reconfiguration of the existing space. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=7953.421s">I</a> know it's a minor thing, but it's the only, she does so good, that was the only thing that jumped out.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7050.925s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7053.204s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7053.664s">I</a> have just a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7056.566s">So</a> I'm particularly interested in item number two and item number three and item number four on the action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7065.793s">And</a> it sounds like there's been an immediate response to put some structures in place to address these topics, which I think is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7079.16s">But</a> I think my question is, or I guess my question is, who is doing those things? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7083.942s">And</a> is it sustainable for them to continue to do those things into the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7087.724s">And</a> if it's not, what is our plan that those actions actually can be sustainable? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7095.747s">And</a> I just, I'm really sensitive to and appreciative of all the people who have put all their hands on deck to address some of these issues that have gone on for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7106.592s">But</a> I also am, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7107.938s">very</a> aware of the work they're supposed to be doing in there every single day, which probably doesn't include some of the things we're asking them to do right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7116.101s">And</a> I'm concerned about that sustainability going forward and what the plan is to make sure that that can continue without being massively disruptive to everything else that has to happen in the district.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7314.616s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7315.356s">And</a> I just want to make sure that it's clear that if you need support from a funding perspective, please tell us what those things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7327.439s">And</a> I know we're going to come up on budget season really fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7330.739s">And</a> we can certainly talk about this again as part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7336.601s">But</a> we want to hear from you if there is support or infrastructure that's lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7343.547s">The</a> idea that this is sustainable through brute force is fraught for lots of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7350.488s">And</a> I want to make sure that if there are things that we need to do so that we can have a little bit more of an efficient way to do these things, that we are pursuing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7360.57s">And</a> if that means investments, I think we're all here to support that and tell the community why it's necessary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7431.057s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7431.577s">And</a> the other request that I have, this school committee is supposed to review and sign off on handbooks on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7439.742s">And</a> I've never done that since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7442.944s">And</a> I am pretty certain that we've talked about it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7446.746s">So</a> I'd like to ask for you to put forward a schedule to us of how you will present those handbooks to us for our review for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7457.571s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7459.028s">And</a> it would be really great if there was some tracking mechanism when you share those documents with us so we can understand like what does it look like today and what are you proposing the changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7469.473s">And</a> you know I think these like we just need to make sure that there's enough time for us to do a good diligent job of that because it's not been done as long as we've been on the committee, so I think that's it's really important that we get into a better. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7486.252s">and</a> more consistent annual process to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7491.096s">We'll</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7491.516s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8340.461s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8342.402s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8344.082s">Regarding</a> the survey that's going out, how does that square with the RFP that we are in the process of releasing to do something very similar?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8399.075s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8400.675s">Two</a> other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8402.036s">I</a> did see that Desi has <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8405.291s">a</a> grant opportunity on their website around violence prevention in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8410.077s">And</a> I don't know if we are planning to apply for that or if that's a good fit for our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8415.222s">But</a> I did see that a couple of community members had mentioned it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8418.406s">So</a> I wanted to make sure that we discussed it here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8426.127s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8427.307s">And</a> then my last I guess it's a request when you know we talked. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8433.629s">It</a> was probably a year ago now and Stacey Shulman was here and I asked her a question around do students know how to access the services that are available to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8446.432s">And</a> she did say <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8447.847s">you</a> know, at that time, this was a year ago, that they were finding that the answer was no, not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8454.291s">That</a> students really did still have, like, were unaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8459.435s">And</a> I know that you all have been working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8461.716s">But</a> the other thing that I am hearing, particularly from parents and students, is that beyond just knowing that those services are available for you to reach out and ask for help, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8475.074s">The</a> question I have for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8477.135s">Schulman</a> to consider is how are we identifying people we should be reaching out to and not waiting for students to get to a place or a space or a willingness to come seeking services? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8491.259s">So</a> how can we be more proactive with those students who we see in the building who may be struggling for one reason or another to provide some outreach to them and let them proactively know what the options are for them <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8503.584s">What</a> services are available and that there are like people there to help because I think sometimes as you know with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8512.087s">Whether</a> they're like willing to go out and seek services for themselves is as individual as like all the students in the building are so. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8520.353s">I</a> just want to make sure that there's a mechanism there too among the adults in the building that we can identify students who might need some of that help and find a way to reach students who may not have found the way or the desire to reach us first.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8925.603s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8927.303s">Before</a> we move on, I didn't know if there was anyone in the audience who wanted to speak on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8933.486s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8934.326s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10047.79s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10049.091s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10051.073s">I</a> just had some questions or some suggestions to make the contract a little bit more clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10059.435s">Um,</a> so in the, um, in the contract, it talks about your final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10066.218s">Um,</a> I want a couple of things about that final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10069.999s">I</a> would like it to explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10071.84s">Um,</a> request that you will, in addition to making recommendations that you will provide us your recommendation on the timeline and the implementation plan that it would take to actually do the things that you're going to outline, because. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10088.198s">I'm</a> a consultant myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10090.719s">And</a> if you just give somebody a report and they put it on a shelf, they've wasted, they've wasted their money, and I want to make sure that we are reacting to what you're saying we're prioritizing those expenditures if there are any. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10105.517s">And</a> that we have the community has a marker of like what this timeline is because you're right like there's a lot of there's a lot of urgency in the immediate. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10118.989s">Moments</a> that gets reacted to, but none of it is sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10124.014s">That,</a> like the immediate response is just like inherently never going to be sustainable and so in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10131.929s">for</a> the climate and the culture of the building and our school to change like that sustainability has to come like to priority for us and so I'd like to see that be an explicit part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10144.605s">the</a> deliverable. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10146.306s">The</a> other thing I would ask about the final deliverable is that the language state that you will also provide us a draft and provide us individually opportunity to give you feedback before the final report is just issued to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10163.191s">Because</a> I think we will want to know and we'll have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10169.232s">And</a> again, I don't want to just get a report that <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10171.872s">could</a> have really been actionable for us, but it left something out that we think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10177.867s">And</a> then I think the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10181.114s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10182.555s">So,</a> I guess I just wanted to sort of like describe the changes that I'm looking for and find out like how you want to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10191.458s">I</a> think the other question that I had is this has an end date of February 28th and my question for you is whether all of this can reasonably and realistically be done by February 28th because II think, you know, these kinds of things take <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10207.455s">time.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10208.636s">And</a> there's, you know, everybody's doing their day job, everybody's operating the school and all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10213.798s">So</a> just the pure access to the people that you need, I think my question to you, and I totally defer to your judgment, is whether February 28 is the right date, or if there needs to be some sort of flexibility, like clause in the contract that allows that to continue, if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10232.786s">So</a> those, those are like the three things that <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10235.826s">I</a> would either suggest I'm happy to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10238.068s">I</a> just didn't know if you are looking for us to approve this contract or just make the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10246.255s">So</a> more question to you about how you want to proceed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10661.883s">I</a> was going to make a motion to approve as amended, but maybe we should let Member Ruseau speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10669.818s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10769.735s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10772.556s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to approve this as amended with the following amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10777.957s">One</a> is that the recommendations explicitly include an implementation plan and a timeline, and that school committee feedback will be incorporated before the final report is delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10793.442s">And</a> in addition to that, the intellectual property <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10798.854s">Section</a> will be amended to explicitly state that interview notes will not be shared with the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10808.163s">They</a> will be destroyed within 60 days after the conclusion of the contract, but that the final report will provide a summary of interviews for posterity. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10821.328s">I</a> think that's a way, because I don't think you should share your interview notes with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10826.152s">I</a> don't think you'll get the kind of feedback that we need you to have in order to provide us good solid feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10832.476s">So</a> I think it makes sense to be explicit about the destruction of those notes and that instead, and in lieu of like turning over all of those work notes that you would just provide a summary as part of that appendix to the report.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10863.505s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=10864.145s">Forgot</a> that one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11356.001s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11358.33s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11358.851s">I</a> have two questions, a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11364.798s">From</a> the time that the MSBA accepts somebody into a feasibility study to the time where there's a shovel in the ground, how many years is that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11449.245s">I</a> agree, but I also look at all the students who are going to graduate from Medford High in its current state, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11458.257s">including</a> probably every kid in our middle schools right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11461.339s">And</a> I'm not feeling terribly encouraged by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11466.462s">So</a> I think that's the challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11468.804s">And</a> I think my question is, what else can we do as a community so that we are not looking at an entire generation of students either graduating from the current high school in its current state or surviving like a construction project essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11488.361s">I</a> can we do?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11611.316s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11612.757s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we prepare to resubmit a statement of interest <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11619.147s">in</a> this upcoming round.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11738.591s">So</a> we good. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11739.291s">Can</a> we amend it to say April 1, apply by April 1.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11755.735s">So</a> I think the thing that I'm reacting to is there was sort of a hustle last year at the very end to coordinate all the bodies who needed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11767.982s">And</a> I want to make sure that doesn't happen again, especially like when you come up to April, you're talking about a school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11774.377s">You're</a> talking about a change in like operations, both for the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11781.042s">So</a> I just, I do want us to be done before we're sort of chaotically trying to make sure that votes can be taken in time for the deadline.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11804.329s">The</a> motion to submit another statement of interest with periodic updates to this committee and submission in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11815.097s">And</a> then we'll maybe get a timeline.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11847.229s">And</a> so if we could may I just ask one more question about MSBA.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11856.644s">Oh,</a> given this, and we actually heard tonight from our students about network access. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11865.909s">We</a> talk about this rather incessantly about our high school complex and how challenging it is to communicate inside the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11875.254s">I</a> would also like to make a motion that the administration provides us a recommendation and a plan to fix that problem in a permanent way. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=11886.112s">in</a> our existing building structure because we cannot afford to wait an entire generation of students before we have working internet in our high school building.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6763.726s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6765.538s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6767.098s">I</a> just wanted to thank everyone who spoke tonight, especially the students who came up to tell us about their experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6776.581s">You</a> know, a couple of things are clear to me from the comments and reinforce the conversations that we've been having. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6784.458s">as</a> a community for quite a while now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6787.162s">So</a> first is that there's a lot of really wonderful things happening in Medford and specifically in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6796.334s">We</a> heard today lots of thanks for the teachers who <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6802.027s">had</a> a really difficult job to do today as they were the adults in the room and they acted with professionalism and grit and fortitude at what was a very, very hard day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6819.6s">So</a> my sincere thanks to all the teachers who are listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6825.484s">But</a> I think the other thing that's really clear is that there are a number of things that we're getting very wrong as a system. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6835.39s">And</a> what we're hearing from students that is perhaps the most concerning for me is that from their vantage point, nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6846.976s">I</a> know <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6848.191s">that</a> there is a lot going on behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6852.313s">I</a> know that there is a lot of activity in process and in progress to enact change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6861.496s">I</a> know that change is sometimes painfully slow and hard, but I think what we have to really grapple with is striking some balance between <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6877.29s">improving</a> our communications in a truly systemic way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6880.391s">Our</a> parents feel unsupported, our students feel unsupported. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6889.055s">As</a> a community, we've really never gotten crisis response right in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6898.9s">And</a> I will never forget the night I sat in the auditorium for five hours, and at that time, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6906.056s">I</a> sat there and I just kept wondering, where is our crisis response team? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6912.819s">Are</a> they equipped to do this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6917.141s">And</a> I have those same questions today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6918.642s">I</a> would like to, so I think the technicalities of hearing all of you tonight, we all wanted to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6931.608s">We</a> felt very unanimous about that, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6935.641s">Um,</a> but I do think we also have a responsibility to make sure that we are upholding, um, our requirements under the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6943.447s">And</a> so I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6945.309s">What</a> you're probably not going to hear from us tonight is, um, a particular action that we're instructing anybody to take, because that is where we sort of like dip over that line, um, and, and cause, um, question cause anything we might do to come into question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6964.024s">But</a> what I would like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6966.152s">is</a> make a motion that before the return to school in January, we will hold a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6974.476s">We</a> will hold an executive session where the school committee will be fully briefed on safety and security protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6981.679s">And</a> then we will hold a public meeting that will describe for parents what the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6989.356s">student</a> accountability processes, what the responsibility of the adults in the room is, how that has changed, and as well, what parents can look forward to as we continue, because I think there is a set of immediate actions that has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7007.481s">But</a> I also think that this is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7012.462s">It</a> has existed <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7014.726s">for</a> years, going back at least to those gun clip moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7020.429s">And</a> probably further, we heard about race riots back many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7026.712s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that we hold that meeting between now and the time students return to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7035.056s">So</a> that's the end of my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7038.82s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7041.221s">What</a> I would like to say, though, before my colleagues might weigh in on that is that, you know, this problem of the bathrooms is a problem I hear about from lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of different angles. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7057.848s">And</a> there is a problem with supervision in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7061.849s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7063.81s">But</a> what I would also say is that that is a symptom of <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7068.953s">deeper</a> issues of consistency of how our rules are enforced by those responsible for doing it, whether those actions are carried out with consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7083.299s">I</a> have questions about whether there is an appropriate systemic support to allow that decision making to be good, solid and consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7092.222s">And</a> I would also, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7094.707s">you</a> know, like to know in that meeting how we all can have a better understanding of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7106.219s">beyond</a> the student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7108.08s">I</a> think this is something that warrants really clear professional communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7113.282s">And</a> I know that is an area that we deeply struggle with at Medford public schools, but we need to find a way through this communications situation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7125.686s">And</a> the last thing I will say to everybody who has been involved, I think we're all here to listen <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7135.327s">and</a> hear what you need from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7139.069s">If</a> you need us to support expenditures, if you need us to support you as you make hard decisions about staff, if you need us to support hard decisions about prioritization of which staff are needed, we're here to do all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7157.694s">We</a> were elected to make hard decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7160.796s">I</a> don't think I've ever gotten to make very easy decisions since I have been on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7164.938s">And</a> I think, you know, we want to hear from the people who we hire and pay to do this work in our schools every single day, what they need from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7176.865s">We</a> want the teachers to be at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7178.646s">I</a> do think we will get a better product when we talk and listen to students and teachers as we go through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7185.934s">Um,</a> but I do think we have to have a comprehensive approach that is both, um, confidential where it is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7195.897s">And</a> there will be wildly unsatisfying moments where things are necessarily confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7201.98s">Um,</a> and the superintendent has my full support as she makes those hard decisions and, and upholds the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7208.302s">Um,</a> but I think we also have to find a way for this community to understand what part <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7214.949s">they</a> can play, how they can help, and what we are going to do differently in the immediate term, as well as, as we continue forward this year, into the summer, into next year, this is a hard problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7230.621s">We</a> need to prioritize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7232.822s">We</a> need to think about how our students feel safe and supported in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7237.826s">Every</a> single person in this room wants that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7240.028s">We</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7240.688s">I</a> think where we all have, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7243.946s">work</a> to do is to figure out the how and that I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7248.869s">I</a> think it's work we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7250.109s">And</a> thank you, Member McLaughlin for supporting my motion that we have an in depth discussion that is compliant with the open meeting law before the start of school.<h2><a href="../2022-12-06_NndFNuozZb4/2022-12-06_NndFNuozZb4.html">Rules & Policy Subcommittee Meeting 12.6.2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=802.293s">I</a> totally agree with <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=804.605s">Member</a> McLaughlin, that this document is really undigestible in its current form. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=809.646s">And</a> so, I don't know, it checks some boxes, but I don't think that's what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=815.447s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we can get to a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=819.348s">I</a> think as I was doing a little bit of research, the school committee does not have a bullying policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=826.469s">This</a> plan is really supposed to be, I think, owned by the superintendent and the administration, which I am fine with. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=834.531s">So</a> I think out of this work has to come an actual policy by the school committee that can then help inform the plan to implement the policy and execute the policy on a consistent basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=849.821s">And</a> I would tend to agree that this is one of those things like picking your health plan that you don't pay any attention to until you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=863.044s">And</a> I use that example a lot because you can't predict if you're gonna need a chiropractor this year, if you've never needed a chiropractor before, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=871.301s">And</a> so when you pick your plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=874.346s">You</a> don't say, what kind of chiropractic coverage does this plan offer me? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=878.028s">Because</a> it's just not even in your purview to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=880.789s">And</a> so what happens then when the need arises, you have to educate yourself really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=886.132s">And</a> you are often like surprised and maybe disappointed at times, depending on what your choice was, about what you find as you try to educate yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=897.798s">And</a> I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=899.199s">when</a> families find themselves in this position, some of the things that I have heard thematically are questions around consistency, are questions around I didn't know or who was supposed to tell me, so I think people really feel at a loss when this happens to them and they're trying to educate themselves quickly that there is a really quick and easy way <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=926.707s">to</a> sort of get educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=929.589s">And</a> so as we think about sort of like bifurcating the policy from the plan and certainly the professional development that needs to happen, I think we also do need to think about what are those one-pagers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=944.62s">And</a> I think we have to get on a cadence of hosting regular forums about what bullying means. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=951.285s">Because</a> I think the other thing that you hear happening in the community is, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=955.328s">that</a> at each and every sort of altercation that you have that's unpleasant, everyone is making assessments about is or is that not bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=967.737s">And,</a> you know, we need to get to a place where we can educate the public with some consistency about what the definition of bullying really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=980.455s">Because</a> I don't think I don't think our residents are willfully ignorant, I think they want to know and I think it's really hard for them to figure this stuff out because they don't speak school and they don't come to school every day to be educators right so. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=995.319s">we</a> need to sort of help bridge the gap with families as we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1000.043s">And</a> I think this is like one of many topics where I think we could do more to help families feel educated and empowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1009.511s">But</a> I think in this particular case, we need to find a way both in our policy and in our plan to insist on <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1020.624s">and</a> require absolute consistency in how we handle these incidents when they come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1030.571s">Because</a> I think that consistency is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1034.594s">I</a> think lack of consistency leads to all kinds of problems, including under-reporting, people looking the other way, people with the best of intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1044.541s">And</a> I think we have heard this in commentary here and there that, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1048.598s">you</a> know, reporting things doesn't really do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1051.1s">I</a> have heard that from students, and I want to make sure that on a very consistent basis, we can make sure that people know that we are, A, we have a policy, and B, that we are following it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1069.23s">And</a> hopefully see that leads to better outcomes, right, because that's why we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1073.852s">So</a> I do think, you know, as we go through this work, we probably need to try to focus first on the school committee policies so that the administration can then do their work in terms of lining up the <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1090.312s">The</a> plan and the visuals and we probably need to work together on the parent education side of things, because I feel like that is a realm that is a little bit more squishy about, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1104.585s">whose</a> responsibility it is, I think that's a collaborative effort would really make a lot of sense there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1111.269s">But</a> I think we're probably gonna have to take it one step at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1114.97s">And</a> I think along the way, I wanna encourage people to speak and share their experience, but just ask people to be really cautious about disclosing specific student situations <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1133.6s">with</a> us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1134.701s">This</a> is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1135.501s">I</a> just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1136.601s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're all sort of mindful that that is a really important thing for us to do as we do this work to try to protect all the kids in the mix too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1148.225s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1272.763s">No,</a> I actually did just want to respond to something Mike said. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1277.725s">I</a> think it's a really good point that there is a difference between conflict and bullying and that we probably do need to start to create some language and some words from a consistency perspective around those two ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1294.452s">But</a> I think the other thing we need to really be thinking about as we do that is <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1301.169s">Is</a> there a progression from conflict to bullying, and I think the answer is probably sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1308.054s">And</a> I think the question that we are going to have to answer procedurally for the administration is how do we make sure that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1317.501s">being</a> proactive enough in conflict that we aren't allowing situations to like turn into bullying situations and issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1325.846s">So</a> I think that's sort of one thing that is really important for us to think about as we like explore this like educational space. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1334.372s">The</a> other thing that that you said that sort of resonated with me is we take a long time to investigate these issues and <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1344.304s">I</a> think, again, from an education perspective, we need people to understand what those investigation steps are and what a reasonable timeline is to expect for these things to unfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1358.954s">And</a> I fully expect everybody who has to actually execute those investigation steps to push back hard on the notion of like relative timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1368.059s">But</a> I do think in the big scheme of <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1372.122s">How</a> we sort of move the collective forward like we need to give people some some sort of like understanding of what that framework is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1378.069s">And,</a> but I think also in the context of that i'm really interested in making sure that, while these investigations need to be thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1391.482s">they</a> do need to be sort of as swift as they can possibly be so that there aren't like escalating issues going on while the investigation is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1404.886s">And</a> I would like for us at some point to talk about what are the like parent communication expectations when somebody is in like this process of an investigation and <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1420.08s">how</a> can we make sure that the families as they are going through this feel supported even in the reality that they will probably <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1436.115s">never</a> be satisfied with the information that we can share with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1439.118s">I</a> think that's a reality but I don't think that precludes us from helping families feel supported along the way and I think we have to figure out how we do that and what the models are that again allow us to do that with consistency but those are the things that I <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1459.555s">I</a> was thinking about as you were talking and I, but I could not agree with you more that this education space is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1469.006s">And</a> even, you know, using this topic as a place to talk about curriculum, I think is a huge opportunity because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1481.013s">know,</a> parents don't know what the curriculum is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1482.895s">I</a> think people go to curriculum night and they get like, you know, a very short spiel about a lot of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1490.583s">And</a> there, you know, there is and is going to continue to be changed, but curriculum around this and an approach that our school system takes when these things happen and <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1502.575s">how</a> we are teaching kids conflict resolution that I think in this context would really help people like glue all those pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1511.744s">That</a> I think would be really beneficial.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1968.188s">My</a> kids are out of elementary school now, sadly, Miss Deimos, but Lucas was there in the inaugural year of Nexus. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1983.171s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1984.999s">I</a> pressed him for information many, many, many times and I was wildly unsuccessful in getting him to tell me anything other than his real feelings about going to Nexus class. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=1998.722s">And</a> I think it sounds particularly in tandem with everything else that's going on, like such a great, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2010.745s">block</a> of time and way to dedicate the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2015.308s">But</a> I wonder if there is, again, some education for parents that helps them understand what happens in that class and how they might <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2031.4s">extract</a> good conversations out of their kids about the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2035.061s">Like,</a> and maybe I just wasn't very good at it, but it was, I was unsuccessful for like an entire school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2041.923s">And</a> I think I've heard that from other parents too, that they're like, we don't, I don't know what it is and I don't know how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2049.765s">And</a> if you have, you know, there will always be a subset of parents that are like, tell me how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2055.507s">Like</a> I struggle with this at home too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2057.907s">So</a> I'm just wondering if there's a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2060.768s">When</a> we think about education in this realm of bullying to be talking a little bit more about the nexus program and like why you all love it so much, and what they can expect to hear from their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2076.34s">and</a> how they can expect to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2078.881s">How</a> can they get engaged? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2081.821s">And</a> even better, where are those related resources for parents to meet their kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2087.662s">Because</a> if my kid came home and said, I'm feeling orange today, I'm not sure I would know what to do with that other than to say, well, what do you mean by that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2097.164s">But</a> if there's language and capacity being built, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=2101.166s">in</a> the schools, I think there are parents who might be interested in how that can help them at home.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3122.095s">And</a> I also would assume that the superintendent is going to want to coordinate her team's input on this in a cohesive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3134.061s">So</a> I would, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3136.385s">think,</a> although you can, you know, disagree, Superintendent, that you would not want 15 administrators in this document making live changes necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3150.668s">But,</a> you know, you may want to think about how you want to sort of engage with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3157.649s">I</a> think the other thing that ultimately maybe becomes a little bit different is <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3164.608s">if</a> this really does become two documents, a policy and a plan to support that policy, if that is where we head, and I think it is where we should go, the policy is certainly a document that the school committee and how we proceed through it is really, really important according to the open meeting law, but the superintendent like building out the plan to demonstrate that <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3194.128s">she</a> and her team are implementing the policy is not subject to the open meeting law as it is created. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3200.271s">And</a> that work down the line may be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3203.433s">So</a> I think from a process standpoint, I am wondering if it makes sense first for us to maybe put this aside for a minute and think about the draft <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3220.336s">of</a> a policy that obviously probably has some like components in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3225.7s">But</a> do we first start with a policy like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3233.506s">And</a> so do we start with something like this and we like work through this to the point where we feel like from a policy standpoint, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3241.092s">And</a> then the next step being we turn our attention to the plan from there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3292.773s">So-</a> And I guess it's my take that the superintendent can't update the plan until there is a policy for her to make sure she is tacking to as she does that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4152.998s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4155.139s">I</a> just wanted to circle back to Eunice's question about sort of there being a lot of confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4162.525s">I</a> think that's really fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4164.686s">I</a> think of policy as the what. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4168.288s">What</a> do we want the superintendent to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4171.311s">And</a> I think of her procedures or her plans as the how. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4176.815s">how</a> will it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4178.076s">So</a> I would expect things just as an example, like I would expect us to say, we want you to have two bullying information sessions per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4193.092s">What</a> we're not gonna say in the policy is, and they should be on the third Tuesday of the month, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4200.089s">of</a> the fourth month of the school year at 7pm, so I think of that as like a pretty simplistic example but it's it's always super murky, particularly when you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4213.723s">care</a> that the policies can be enacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4216.664s">And</a> I think that's where the collaboration between the school committee and the superintendent's office is really important because nobody wants to spend this time to write policy that can't be executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4228.548s">But</a> we also wanna make sure that if something can't be executed, that we're having that dialogue about why not, so that either we can find a compromise that does not compromise <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4242.552s">the</a> what, or that we can prioritize the resources that are needed to actually make that what available by giving the right tools to the superintendent and her team to make the how happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4255.587s">So</a> I think it is murky, particularly when you talk about change, because you need both of those things and they need to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4262.677s">and</a> then you need to actually go forth and execute. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4264.938s">So</a> yeah, it is murky, but I think like for me and I get wrapped up in the how, because I'm an implementer at heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4275.364s">So</a> I do try to remember what versus how, and that usually sort of brings me back to like the ground floor of like what we're trying to do with policy.<h2><a href="../2022-12-05_CrEp94TD4IM/2022-12-05_CrEp94TD4IM.html">12.5.2022 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1135.498s">Member</a> Graham, thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1138.181s">Can</a> you just tell us how many students are enrolled in each of the programs <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1145.205s">today,</a> like how many of the 330 enrolled are at each school? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1149.927s">Do</a> you know roughly?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1180.138s">And</a> if I am recalling the history of that, correct, it's actually fairly new that there are wait lists outside of the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1188.662s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1218.374s">I</a> think you've also talked at times about particularly at the Brooks, there really not being a lot of opportunity to expand that program further because it poses some challenges and some safety issues and that kind of thing for that group to expand beyond its current number of seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1235.199s">Is</a> that still true at the Brooks?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1238.62s">And</a> does that mean then that if we were able to find more staff that the other programs could expand?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2540.612s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2541.092s">I</a> just wanted to mention as well that I at one point I had pulled some of our school committee colleagues across the state about this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2548.814s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2552.475s">universally</a> everyone said we have the same problem and they also and some some folks went on to say <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2563.109s">What</a> do you mean your community thinks our community has solved this problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2567.053s">Because</a> we have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2568.994s">We</a> do have wait lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2570.696s">There</a> are a lot of communities across the state who have just sort of gotten out of this business altogether because it's problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2576.341s">And</a> those folks said, even though we have done away with our programs, we still get constant complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2583.927s">about</a> the lack of afterschool care available in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2588.192s">And</a> we're not even in the business of doing this anymore because we have made those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2593.778s">So</a> I'm not saying that to suggest that we should stop trying, but I am saying that to suggest that like, we are truly not unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2603.468s">in</a> terms of the problem statement, which is that more people require care for their children after school than is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2612.475s">That</a> problem statement is a problem statement that communities across the state and definitely in this area, Melrose, Somerville, Arlington, as far as I am aware, all of them have these same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2624.645s">they</a> look different, their programs look really different in some cases than ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2628.588s">Like</a> I think Arlington is an example where their program looks really, really different than ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2633.592s">But</a> it doesn't mean that they don't have the same problem that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2637.556s">And</a> I say that because I know that it is <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2641.815s">super</a> frustrating for me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2644.738s">The</a> program wasn't ever even an option for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2647.7s">Like</a> we just, A, we didn't know about it, but B, even if we knew about it, it didn't meet our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2652.164s">So</a> as much as we talk about all the people who the program can serve, like we also are not serving a whole other population of members of our community who the program just doesn't work for them from a logistical perspective for other reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2666.216s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2666.892s">I</a> think it is a big and complex problem and I think that we are still trying to like work to solve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2671.875s">Some</a> of the work we've done with the power contract this year was aimed at creating another role that would help us feed this after school program, but these things are not, you know, they're not quick fixes, they do take time and we need to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2688.647s">you</a> know, our ask of the administration is clear that the time be spent to try to cultivate additional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2694.812s">And</a> again, I truly don't want to be in a position where we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2701.274s">decrease</a> capacity in a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2703.255s">And</a> I think the only way to not have that decision to make is to make sure that all the other programs can come up to some sort of reasonable equivalency. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2713.321s">And</a> I think that is a lot of work that probably needs to start, and I know that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2719.204s">I</a> think we need to figure out how do we create some more interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2723.827s">I</a> don't know, Superintendent, if you can include our needs in your weekly memo for a couple of weeks to see if there's some additional interest out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2734.605s">Yeah,</a> I think there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of stones still to turn over, but I wanna make sure we're still doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2743.969s">And</a> as for the books, I know that is the biggest program and there really is no opportunity to expand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2752.892s">That</a> is where another location, that is where another alternative comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2757.134s">So</a> I think we have to continue to try to be creative about that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2866.835s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2869.457s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2869.637s">Fidler-Carey,</a> I think the other thing that's relevant when you talk about the differences in the programs is that there's a real enrollment difference between our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2877.945s">So</a> I believe the Brooks has 150 more students every day than Mnistutak does. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2884.251s">So</a> it is not, like, I think it is a very complicated picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2887.374s">You</a> have to look at all of those variables, but our enrollment is not the same in all of our schools either. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2893.56s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2895.041s">when</a> you start talking about what percentage of students you're serving, I think that's just another dimension that makes this really complicated.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5527.257s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5527.837s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5530.399s">Thank</a> you, Shanine, for all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5531.98s">I</a> know it's been a spirited group and we've had a lot of good discussion and sometimes spirited groups are really hard to manage and you've done a really lovely job listening to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5544.867s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5548.09s">I</a> remember Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5549.171s">Stone</a> was just asking me about the timeline of like, when can a shovel go in the ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5553.994s">And</a> I told her what I thought, but I think you guys should answer that question more officially. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5561.419s">And</a> just to reiterate, like, if you look at the planned funding, the funding is not coming out of our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5570.366s">Those</a> are capital budget requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5573.328s">It's</a> one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5574.849s">And</a> I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5577.196s">where</a> uniquely in a place where there is one-time funding available for this, which is great, because I don't believe we would see it out of our operating budget in any way, shape, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5591.923s">But</a> the other thing I wanted to suggest to the committee is that, or I'll make a motion that we send the funding <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5602.148s">the</a> naming to the sorry, we'll send a request to the strategic planning subcommittee that they work on and create <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5614.076s">a</a> naming and fundraising policy for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5618.78s">That</a> would certainly be guidance for this program, but I think as we look forward to hopefully some other really big, amazing projects in Medford Public Schools that having some guidance and some precedent around naming and fundraising on behalf of our schools can be sort of thoughtfully entertained now rather than in the heat of those moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5643.197s">That</a> is my motion to send to the strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=5646.48s">That</a> would be really helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9274.772s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9276.084s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9276.505s">I've</a> seen a question floating around in a couple of different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9284.643s">that</a> goes something like if you wanted to give the teachers a bonus, you could just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9290.727s">Or</a> could you just do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9293.408s">I</a> think it's actually a question, a genuine one, like we don't know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9299.913s">So</a> because we are under a collective bargaining agreement, any and all compensation must be driven through collective agreement with our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=9308.919s">Is</a> that true?<h2><a href="../2022-11-21_7D6c0Dkkm94/2022-11-21_7D6c0Dkkm94.html">11.21.2022 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7135.522s">Mayor,</a> before you do that, I also wanted to offer a friendly amendment to number one, to read how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7147.247s">in-school</a> suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, detentions, social probations, and other forms of discipline? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7156.571s">Are</a> there at each grade level, and to member Rousseau's point, issued and served? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7165.095s">So</a> I was hoping to get a little bit more information about some of these bigger categories of student discipline so that we can understand for ourselves <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7177.443s">when</a> we are suspending in school versus out of school, when we are putting kids on social probation, when we are issuing detentions, and then, you know, that sort of nuance of are we issuing and they're being served or are we issuing and they're not being served, probably more in the case of like a detention, but wanted to see that same breakout for all of those categories.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7201.224s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7210.447s">I'm</a> not sure what you mean by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7211.828s">I</a> I don't know what the other categories are either. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7215.029s">So,</a> I think I'm looking for the administration to identify if there's something missing from that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7219.991s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7220.231s">That</a> is commonly executed in our schools and I wanna know about that too.<h2><a href="../2022-11-16_Azob8X18NRY/2022-11-16_Azob8X18NRY.html">Rules & Policy Subcommittee Meeting 11.16.2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1938.79s">Um,</a> I think, you know, one of the things that strikes me is, uh, why we're even talking about this in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1946.414s">And</a> I think the truth is we're talking about this because parents feel like these concepts that I think are pretty widely agreeable on this call are wildly inconsistently applied across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1961.222s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1963.303s">It's</a> been a few years since recess was normal and things were regular, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1971.486s">But</a> I can recall pre-COVID on many a day getting calls from friends with kids across the district saying, did your kid go out for recess today? <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1982.771s">And</a> the answers were all over the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1984.752s">And</a> I'm here to say the weather is the same everywhere in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1989.255s">maybe</a> once a year, it starts raining at the McGlynn later than it starts raining at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1994.321s">But</a> by and large, the weather's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1997.585s">And</a> yet, every time this question came up, there was a huge variation in how <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2006.225s">something</a> as simple as the weather was interpreted across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2010.41s">I</a> also had friends at various schools who would have told you that their kids spent most of the winter inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2019.752s">for</a> one reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2021.013s">And</a> I think, and I remember talking to the prior assistant superintendent of elementary education right before I took office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2028.798s">And</a> she gave me a very long list of reasons why kids could not possibly go outside in certain schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2037.843s">And</a> my challenge to her at the time and my challenge to all of us is to think about what it would take so that <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2046.048s">movable</a> barriers don't get in the way of kids going outside for recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2050.391s">I</a> think you know at the middle school level where the kids have a little bit more agency and some and a lot more freedom to direct their time like all the things that we talked about at the middle school level feel like they are child directed and they are <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2065.18s">They</a> are helping children develop decision making skills that I think are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2069.725s">I</a> think at the elementary level where the kids have considerably less agency, and many fewer choices like I'm not aware that the library at recess is an option at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2080.997s">I</a> think we need to really think about how do we make sure that we are consistently applying whatever the policy becomes across the district so that we're not like sort of creating this feeling that depending on what school you're at you're going to have a different experience and your kid may or may not get to move their body during the day in a way that they feel like is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2105.377s">So</a> I think that's one big reason why we are here talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2109.298s">And</a> I think the other big reason we're here talking about that is because there are parents across our community and some very vocal who will tell you about all the times their kid has been, recess has been revoked from their child for disciplinary reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2124.881s">Again,</a> I hear about it much, much more at the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2129.302s">That's</a> probably because middle schoolers come home and they don't tell you anything about what happened during their day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2135.883s">Or</a> maybe they just have many more choices, but I do hear, you know, from parents about this idea of taking recess away as a form of punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2146.647s">And</a> I do, so I do think, you know, if we're to boil down why we're here and why we are feeling like there needs to be a policy at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2153.77s">Those</a> are the two reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2155.131s">And</a> those are like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2156.491s">historical</a> experiences that are sort of consistent and repeated that we need to grapple with as a district to make sure that I think this thing we all agree on here on this call actually can be demonstrated and everybody else in the community can believe us when we say we believe in child-directed play. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2177.145s">So</a> I feel like that's sort of the challenge that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2181.908s">before</a> us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2182.549s">And</a> I think that's where having a written policy about, you know, what the expectations are around recess is, you know, one first step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2194.274s">And</a> then, you know, it will be incumbent on many of the people on this call to actually make sure that policy is consistently applied and administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2202.298s">But</a> I think the first step is for us to have this thoughtful conversation about what from a policy perspective are we trying to accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2210.503s">I</a> want you all to think that we asked you to come here because we made up some work to do that didn't need done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2217.208s">And</a> I don't think that's true at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2218.409s">So</a> I just wanted to offer that to the conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3356.781s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3358.661s">I</a> also wanted to be unequivocally clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3363.464s">We</a> are not looking to micromanage anything, at least I am not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3367.767s">I</a> would say that, if anything, my criticism is of the Medford School Committee, who it's 2022, and we don't have a policy on recess and we are an anomaly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3381.071s">So</a> many, many, many, many, many, many districts have come before us and done this work and we never have and that's not on any of you that's on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3391.664s">But</a> I think what we are trying to do is say we're all part we're all part of this ecosystem and we talked a lot about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3399.112s">accountability</a> and consistency, and there is no way to have accountability and consistency unless there is a policy agreement that we are administering against. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3410.92s">So</a> I think this doesn't have to be onerous, and it doesn't have to be bad, and it certainly doesn't have to be micromanaging, but I do think it's important, if not, to make sure that you all have <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3427.672s">a</a> policy to stand on and say this is the policy in the direction of the district, but also so that the community knows what that policy is and the community can alert you when something is happening that is outside of the bounds of that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3442.145s">Because</a> I think we don't have a good track record in Medford of <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3448.302s">parents</a> telling the administration in a forthright and direct manner when things are not going as they are expecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3456.189s">And</a> I think that's for a lot of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3458.211s">And</a> I think one of those reasons is everybody has different expectations because we as a district have never set the playing field of what those expectations are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3466.039s">So</a> I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3467.9s">And</a> when you do that, and when you can <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3470.963s">educate</a> everybody on what that consistency looks like, you have a better chance of people believing you when you say, this is what we think, or this is how we behave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3483.886s">And</a> because right now, we are just buried under example, after example, after example, and I'm not specifically talking about recess, I'm talking about district wide, of the ways we are inconsistent, or the ways that we are perceived to not be holding people accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3500.93s">And</a> I don't think anybody wants to operate this way at all because I think it's a really brutally painful way for for any organization to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3513.274s">So</a> I guess I would say that we want to do this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3520.918s">We</a> are trying to do this so that we can set that tone of consistency, that you all have the same sort of definition of what that consistency is at the high level, and you can determine how to operationalize that in your buildings, which are quite different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3538.627s">You</a> know, Andy, I am hopeful that the drainage issues that we've addressed will not make this so big of an issue for you this winter, but I know in the past it has been a sizable issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3549.771s">And</a> if we could buy Kirk another piece of land so that he had more space for recess, we should think about doing that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3557.013s">Like</a> there's a lot of operational issues that you all have to sort of figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3562.595s">but</a> if you're all operating to the same consistent standard and you know what that is and the public knows what that is, I think we have a better chance of everybody being on the same page and you all being alerted when something isn't going right so that it can be figured out before somebody is, you know, 50 emails deep to the school committee and giving us a presentation about <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3587.04s">You</a> know, some, some issue or another, and I do think that sort of setting that tone and that tenor for for all of the work that we do from a policy perspective is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3602.913s">should</a> encourage you all to have conversations among yourselves about what you need from us to be able to be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3610.216s">And</a> if that is, I don't know what that is, like a functional playground, maybe on Andy's list right now, because he doesn't have one, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3619.4s">But</a> there may be practical things that are different building to building in the endeavor for us to be consistent and to be looking at equity across the district where <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3632.245s">we</a> need to give something different to the Missittuck than we need to give to the McGlynn because of the circumstances, but that that allows us all to sort of get to the same level playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3642.787s">So</a> I am excited that we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3647.709s">I</a> will say from a school committee perspective, it's very overdue as is the review of the vast majority of our policies or lack of policies since I've been on the committee and trying to work through these <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3662.452s">in</a> some logical manner, I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3664.513s">So</a> I am excited for the idea that we can get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3669.817s">If</a> for no other reason than we can start communicating what these rules are so that parents can start to understand that consistency is a value that we hold and we're trying to take action against it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4871.148s">Yeah,</a> second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4876.151s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5251.747s">I</a> would just like to say, I think I'm on CPC as well as a community development board representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5258.952s">And</a> I think this project is just highlighting that we probably need to speak amongst the CPC if there's mechanisms that can be put in place in the process to ensure that any funds <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5275.534s">invested</a> in projects if there needs to be sort of like a look ahead or understanding of future projects and like how you actually deal with situations like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5288.637s">It</a> feels like it's a bigger discussion because there could be, I think there has been other past projects that this has happened and there could be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5297.058s">And</a> I think it's more like communication and figuring out a mechanism to handle this <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=5302.259s">No,</a> no, I agree.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8aFu2OAn8o&t=8046.953s">I</a> agree I think we can move forward.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4045.272s">Can</a> you tell us that I'm looking at the charter numbers for enrollment this year so 3.95 is our charter school enrollment and I think that amounts to 7 or 8 million dollars of tuition going out to those charter schools has that compared to your past the 3.95 do you know sorry could.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4066.43s">How</a> does the 395 compare to years past?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.428s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.888s">We're</a> going to give you a little break here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6304.87s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to suspend the rules and take items eight and 10 out of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7141.321s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7143.202s">First,</a> I want to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7145.123s">Branley</a> for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7148.652s">It's</a> really hard to speak in front of a large room of people like this, and it's especially hard to deliver the remarks you just gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7156.397s">I</a> am really terribly sorry that your family is going through this, and I hope that as we navigate beyond this, that you will find what you're looking for in terms of change in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7173.528s">Having</a> said that, regarding this motion, give me a second,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7184.683s">When</a> we introduced this climate and culture assessment, it was unanimously approved last fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7189.945s">And</a> it was at least in part a reaction to an incident last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7193.105s">The</a> intent of the motion was not last year was not to narrowly or exclusively address the incident itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7200.972s">I</a> will say that safety and supervision are foundational in daily activities at any school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7205.256s">It's</a> reasonable to assume that any school has the resources, staff, and structures necessary to perform these basic school functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7212.382s">And</a> when the system doesn't work at these basic functions, it's reasonable to hold the system and the adults accountable for the kind of failure that we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7223.971s">Separately,</a> the point of the climate and culture assessment, for me at least, <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7228.092s">is</a> to take a broader look at our school environment and identify what keeps us from the kind of school we want for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7235.235s">I</a> want to hear from an expert in the field about how we create a culture that largely avoids these kinds of issues that we find ourselves in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7242.558s">I</a> want a system that avoids bullying, avoids contributing to the self-esteem issues we see in some kids, avoids process failures, avoids situations where kids can leave school unnoticed, and avoids the communication and PR situations we too often find ourselves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7258.174s">I</a> want to hear from an expert about how to create that culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7261.676s">I</a> expect the recommendations to be quite broad and to address everything from staffing to org structure, to curriculum, to personnel, to policy, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7270.82s">We</a> keep circling around real solutions that do more than react to a crisis of some kind in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7276.363s">At</a> this point, I think we need to hear from an objective party that doesn't care where you are from, who you know, or why it's always been done that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7284.447s">Our</a> kids and our city in general deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7286.795s">Of</a> course, I would expect discipline to be part of that assessment, but I'll say again that safety and supervision are foundational elements of any school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7294.944s">I</a> don't think the district will ever provide a truly satisfying answer for all the privacy reasons that are wildly unpopular and still truly the law, but <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7306.697s">I</a> do hope that what we can expect from our superintendent and from this committee is accountability, that we will take action and expect more of this district in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7319.501s">It's</a> long past due that we push past the culture and change the culture of this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7325.642s">It's</a> been needed since long before my kids were a part of MPS, and one of them goes to high school next year, in fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7331.524s">Our</a> kids deserve the best we have to offer, and we need to explore every option to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7337.107s">In</a> terms of just one other note that I want to provide to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7341.988s">Franley,</a> the rules and policy subcommittee has on its docket a review of our bullying policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7349.15s">And</a> hopefully that meeting will be scheduled in the next coming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7352.351s">And</a> when it is, we will be sure to reach out and let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7355.852s">I</a> think there's a lot that goes on from a policy perspective that then has to be executed by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7362.294s">And</a> when that comes up, we'll make sure that you're aware so you can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7366.464s">But</a> I do hope my colleagues will join me in again supporting this motion that asks for a detailed update on why this climate and culture assessment hasn't moved forward and what we are going to do to not be here again in three months or six months or a year, having this same conversation and not having done the things that are at our disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7385.621s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7479.861s">Yep,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7525.863s">That</a> couldn't be further from the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7527.324s">I've</a> been following up on it since we asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7531.127s">And</a> I just think it's important for the entire community to be able to hear that same update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7536.657s">that</a> we committee members often get behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7538.959s">So</a> I'm hoping that the administration will have something to report to us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7543.423s">So</a> it took 11 months.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2912.793s">I</a> know and I feel I'm on the same page with you and David. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2916.113s">Um,</a> well, first of all, I'd like to take a step back and say like, as as a resident, I'm very excited that this project is coming before the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2926.896s">And</a> I would love to see it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2928.576s">And</a> I'm even more excited that it's by a community member. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2933.818s">So</a> that gives a little more <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2936.195s">know,</a> interest in doing good to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2939.296s">I</a> am torn though about the presentation and I'm feeling really uncomfortable and looking for guidance and how this board can actually move towards an approval tonight because everything is sorry, it's too much money and therefore we haven't spent the time to at least give you <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2958.714s">the</a> renderings or the plans that we're used to seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2962.697s">And</a> I get that I'm in real estate development and construction, but there is a way to go about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2971.345s">And</a> I just think we just need to be very clear about what the expectations are and the conditions are and not set a precedent <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2986.878s">that</a> is going to backfire on this board in the future for deviating from expectations that we set in prior.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3827.868s">just</a> very helpful when he's here because he concurs, you know, with certain statements that are made or will try to help explain things or especially his his letter.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5029.445s">That's</a> unfair, that's not what we're trying to do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5035.888s">We're</a> trying to uphold what we are asked to do on behalf of the community and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5043.212s">So</a> I think if the city, if Alicia, <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5046.655s">could</a> help guide us on, and maybe Chair Blumberg, if you could get us back to a place where we have a direction, but what conditions do we have to set or why are you telling us that we have to approve and we have no choice based on a certain set of requirements?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5538.43s">No,</a> no, no, that's not what he said.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6172.999s">Yeah,</a> I think that's a good path. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6176.401s">I</a> think having the conditions that requires them to come back to us to engage more and having those <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6185.001s">sort</a> of safe harbor provisions of looking at, you know, the advancement of the design would make me more comfortable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6577.765s">And</a> I would just like to say, sorry, if this is a major concern for you, then I don't know why this board is going to waste their time on the next hour doing conditions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6612.629s">I</a> feel your pain because this is the work that I do, but it's in your best interest as a new developer to engage in a process like this as early as possible so that you're actually minimizing the risk now and engaging in our conditions and having your architects and engineers do it one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6633.527s">Because</a> the amount of money that you spend on drawings <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6637.21s">is</a> pennies compared to getting farther down the line and having to come back and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6642.882s">And</a> I think you really should think that way now that you're a developer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7481.358s">Can</a> you tie it back to section 6.4, wherever those requirements are? <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7491.723s">Yeah,</a> I mean, one of the things that we as the permit granting authority is trying to back check section 6.4 that the documents that were received, we can confirm that performance criteria is actually being met by what's being presented.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7519.706s">Yeah,</a> right, don't quote me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7524.143s">The</a> appropriate ordinance.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7870.313s">It's</a> only strongly encouraged underneath the 6.4.8 aesthetic standards anyway.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8968.787s">Right,</a> I would just, I would put that, gotta be careful with the licensure or PE designation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8974.69s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8974.89s">It</a> does that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=10221.004s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=10222.885s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=10224.786s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=10253.214s">All</a> right, go to sleep.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4451.769s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4452.21s">I'm</a> just a couple more questions about the change that happened price change with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4460.078s">The</a> price went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4461.179s">The</a> price went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4461.92s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4462.661s">And</a> if there are parents out there who think that <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4468.57s">spending</a> 30 hours on the train is not doable for one reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4472.372s">Do</a> they have other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4474.493s">I</a> think we've gotten some feedback today from parents who are feeling like this was not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5921.51s">Can</a> I just ask a quick question before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5925.253s">How</a> did our absenteeism compared to what happened across the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5928.615s">Like,</a> was it more? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5929.376s">Was</a> it less? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5930.076s">Was</a> it similar?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7504.457s">Just</a> a quick question about the implementation of FOSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7508.62s">Will</a> we be able to say we're done implementing FOSS at the end of this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7512.143s">I</a> feel like we've been talking about this for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7515.305s">And</a> I know COVID has interrupted in the middle of it, but I want us to get to the point where we can close the book on feeling like we're still in implementation mode because there are so many other things that we have to implement at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7531.498s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7533.64s">there</a> seems to still be stuff to do there from an implementation perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7538.63s">And</a> it seems like that's unusual at this point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7616.026s">Yeah,</a> I mean, my kids are done with elementary school at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7618.607s">So</a> that's the concern, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7621.248s">Like</a> when this stuff takes five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7623.562s">you</a> lost a whole building full of kids through the implementation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7627.365s">So</a> I just want to make sure that going forward, like, and again, there's so much to do at the elementary level that I just want to make sure the teachers feel properly supported, that they've had the right PD, they have the supplies that they need, like that just literally were good by the end of this year, because I just next year, it's going to be math and ELA and all the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7650.78s">So</a> I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=7652.802s">I</a> definitely want the teachers to feel like they've had, they've gotten what they need to feel good about delivering this curriculum, which the kids love, because it's hands-on with some fidelity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11548.293s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12300.528s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12332.655s">And</a> if I may, I just have one question or maybe a comment associated with this whole conversation, which is that the introduction of MAP really gives us actionable data in real time that MCAS doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12348.723s">So</a> I'm hoping that at budget time, you will be able to tell us based on what we have seen through MAP, this is how many kids <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12357.99s">require</a> extra support, and this is how many people are needed to provide that extra support, and that the budget ask is commiserate with the number of students who have the need based on the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12372.895s">So</a> I'm hoping that that is where we're headed, that it's sort of viewable to all the rest of us that these shifts are happening, and really that the data is informing the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12387.95s">Is</a> that in the plan?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12393.156s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12393.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12393.957s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12397.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12399.383s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2077.892s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2078.352s">I'm</a> really excited to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2080.933s">I</a> know we've talked about this a couple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2083.434s">A</a> couple of questions I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2085.495s">If</a> somebody would like to participate on the curriculum review team, who do they reach out to? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2093.599s">And</a> how will the community that may not be watching the school committee meeting know to engage in this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2110.574s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2111.634s">And</a> does the HECAT require that the sexual health evaluation be evidence-based?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2166.992s">And</a> the other question I had looking at the timeline, just thinking about the potential budget implications, if you all aren't formulating your responses or your recommendations, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2180.161s">until</a> the June timeframe, it sounds like there just may be a mismatch in terms of what we may or may not need from a budget standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2191.09s">And</a> I didn't know if you took that into consideration when you put the timeline together or if you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2197.735s">And</a> a couple of the things that I think about really specifically are from an implementation perspective, the middle school students who don't get health because they go to band. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2209.605s">you</a> know, the need for health teach credentialed health teachers that we may or may not have in the district at all levels and how that fits into our staffing and our scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2220.756s">And</a> I just feel like there could be like a whole slew of implications from a budget perspective that we would want to be able to prioritize as quickly as possible, because I think this is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2232.577s">if</a> we never show those crazy videos to the fifth graders, again, from Proctor and Gamble, it will be too soon for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2238.958s">So</a> I just wanna make sure that there's nothing at the end of this process that sort of delays our ability to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2245.76s">Because</a> I do think, at least for me, this is a huge priority for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2249.281s">And</a> it is, as you mentioned, like the last man standing around curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2254.702s">And</a> I think we may not be willing to wait for the legislature, for DESE, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2261.633s">for</a> the legislature to step in and say, this has to be a priority for districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2265.897s">So</a> I think our kids need this information and this education. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2270.581s">And</a> I wanna make sure that whatever we can do to clear the path, that we're doing it proactively for you.<h2><a href="../2022-09-19_lRR2dgf0NZM/2022-09-19_lRR2dgf0NZM.html">9.19.2022 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4097.402s">Can</a> I just ask a question I didn't have bills in payrolls in my packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4101.123s">Is</a> that intentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4104.204s">I</a> did.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4132.496s">Motion</a> to approve the remaining consent agenda.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4879.889s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4880.71s">Um,</a> I'm so excited to see these trips returning, and thank you for taking the time to organize, I just had a couple of questions about the insurance, so I think what I'm understanding is that, in general, the cancellation policy <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4898.912s">is</a> 60 to 31 days, you get half of your package back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4904.016s">20</a> to 15 days, you get 75%, or sorry, you get a penalty of 75%, meaning you'd get 25% back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4912.482s">And</a> then zero to 14 days, you don't get anything back on land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4917.366s">But</a> then if you have canceled for any reason, you can get up to 75% back, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4928.561s">Like,</a> I'm just trying to make sure I understand like what this is, because it actually doesn't seem that different than what we were grappling with, like right before the pandemic, where the students were essentially getting nothing back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4940.169s">And</a> I was just curious if the insurance had evolved at all since then, given like, you know, the last two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4947.114s">And</a> I think the other important thing that I think I just wanna make sure I'm clear about is that airfare is not covered by this insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4956.721s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4974.148s">I</a> don't think that's what this says, though.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5024.993s">Okay,</a> so this form governs what happens if you cancel for any reason, which is in addition to getting your money back for like the other reasons that are listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5040.051s">in</a> the details of this, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5062.869s">See</a> what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5063.49s">Okay,</a> and airfare is or isn't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5069.392s">in</a> the refund?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5072.013s">I</a> can let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5073.513s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5075.073s">I</a> just wanna make sure people are clear.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5085.156s">And</a> for cancel for any reason, if you take the insurance and you cancel, is your airfare refunded to you?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5104.382s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure that I think this is like there's a lot of information here and I just want to make sure that we're explaining it to families so we're not relying on them to read this like 20 page like fine print insurance policy because I don't think that they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5119.344s">And</a> I think there were a lot of families that were really, really, really surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5124.345s">And</a> I know it all worked out financially OK when we had to cancel that trip, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5130.259s">It</a> was sort of heartbreaking to listen to students who thought they were going to lose a lot of money and just the issue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5476.39s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5477.311s">Can</a> I just make a suggestion? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5478.491s">I</a> think I would like to make a motion that we approve this field trip contingent on our legal counsel doing a review of this insurance policy and ensuring that the way this is explained to parents is in compliance with the weeds of this insurance policy so that parents know precisely what the policy will and won't cover <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5503.189s">in</a> general, but also specific to COVID scenarios.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7063.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7065.377s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7067.458s">Thank</a> you for this, I had a couple of suggestions and maybe a question so <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7074.156s">In</a> the district improvement goal, last year we approved a climate and culture assessment at the middle school and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7082.3s">And</a> it sort of struck me as I was reading through these bullets that when we talk about some of the goals around communication, that that could be really enlightening and informative, especially as you are now in the schools a little bit more prominently than you've been able to be in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7100.208s">So</a> one outcome, <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7102.719s">suggestion</a> that I would have is to have those climate and culture assessments completed in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7110.264s">That</a> was one suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7111.285s">On</a> the early literacy component, I thought that we were planning to do an evaluation of the literacy curriculum this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7126.535s">Is</a> that still the plan for the elementary literacy?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7170.839s">Great,</a> thanks.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7172.921s">So</a> I think that is another, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7175.189s">substantive</a> piece of work that's a really well aligned with this literacy goal that you might want to include in the outcomes that that process <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7186.162s">gets</a> underway and is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7187.843s">And</a> then I had one question under the accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7192.906s">I</a> did really like that there were some numbers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7195.508s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7197.309s">One</a> question I had on the last bullet, we say 65% of students will meet or exceed their projected growth targets by spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7205.594s">And</a> I just was curious what that number was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7209.156s">So</a> how many did actually meet last year?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7512.669s">Okay,</a> so I, I think as we go forward, like this is really. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7518.579s">somewhat</a> of a uh educated guess at this point because the data last year first year of the use of the tool and the pandemic was just like murky enough that there wasn't a great number there but as we go forward like we'll know at the end of this year like what is the number this year so that next year that number can be more than it is this year so and i think that's what i that was my question was like how can we demonstrate that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7546.624s">wanting</a> more than we got last year in relative terms, but it sounds like we can't do that quite yet because the data is murky enough that we need to, we're gonna use the 65 as like a starting point this year and then go from there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7623.094s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7623.514s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7623.814s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7632.3s">All</a> those in favor- Can I just ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7634.861s">Are</a> we, there were a couple of suggestions that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=7638.343s">Are</a> we approving as amended or

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1612.102s">Do</a> you anticipate any bus stops being eliminated that would be otherwise inside of our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1619.844s">within</a> like a bus stop more than a mile away, more than two miles away being eliminated?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1741.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1742.053s">So</a> I think we've talked a number of times about whether one mile and two mile, particularly the two mile radius issue is the right radius for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1754.103s">And</a> I would submit the traffic going into Medford High in the morning, maybe as an indicator that buses might help, but <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1763.783s">just</a> try to think through when does the committee need to provide guidance to all of you about what changes if any should be made so that they can go into an RFP so that they can be posted because we were not given that opportunity the last time around and this was before your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1779.8s">We</a> were just told here's the contract and we got to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1785.205s">I</a> think there probably are transportation considerations that we should think about before the RFP goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1792.493s">I</a> just don't know what the right timing is for us to have that conversation.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=6868.999s">Anything</a> that we can do to move this along so that we can get to those paras who desperately deserve our attention would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=6878.146s">So</a> whatever we can do.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1016.923s">So</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1019.845s">When</a> I was reading the minutes for the RISE development, one of my big focuses was on making sure that there is some teeth in the agreement for them to negotiate with future tenants for the vocational school and having those basically workforce development and training opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1042.619s">But</a> reading back to the minutes, I didn't see that we actually made that as a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1047.603s">It</a> was more about the community use of the commercial space on the ground floor, unless I missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1056.51s">So</a> I don't, you know, if we didn't, we didn't, but I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with the minutes, but maybe that's something we can circle back and you can remind me how they're actually being <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1070.317s">held</a> to that condition, or if we, what's happening with that development. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1076.358s">Anyway,</a> reading the minutes again just reminded me of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1137.136s">Yeah,</a> that's all I saw, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1140.419s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1141.074s">And</a> I know they submitted a letter before we voted to recommend approval between like the vocational school and everything but I don't know if I guess this is a topic maybe for another time but that are that a pretty important aspect of that development so it'd be nice to know how the city can have some teeth in that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1209.689s">Yeah,</a> I don't think we made a condition about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1213.012s">It</a> must have flipped through, I think.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_BjCn4D5TbjU/2025-06-26_BjCn4D5TbjU.html">Community Development Board 07-14-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=9.049s">Is</a> member Ruseau coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=11.15s">No,</a> he said he couldn't come. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=12.771s">Before</a> it was scheduled.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=196.237s">Sorry,</a> member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=197.738s">Yeah,</a> I wanted to make a motion to rescind the approval of the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=202.76s">We</a> really shouldn't be discussing this at all until we agree that we are rescinding the evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=207.702s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=266.35s">Can</a> I offer a friendly amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=269.601s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=270.881s">Given</a> that we all sat through substantive conversation about this, I would like to ask that we all are afforded the same opportunity to resubmit a review or comments or whatever we may deem appropriate or not, but that the entire committee is afforded the same opportunity.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=336.308s">Well,</a> we don't have an approved evaluation at this point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=339.471s">We</a> just rescinded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=340.451s">So</a> we have to meet again to approve the superintendent's evaluation regardless.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=354.512s">We</a> don't even know what the changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=356.853s">We</a> would be blindly approving a review that we've never seen.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=606.137s">I</a> guess I'm asking my colleagues to acknowledge that we all sat through a substantive discussion and we may all feel like a mistake was made in one way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=618.829s">And</a> I don't understand what the harm is in affording the opportunity for anybody who feels like they <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=628.985s">made</a> a mistake to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=631.606s">And</a> I think it's great if you don't feel that way, but I also think there's at least one member of the committee that's not even here to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=637.87s">So</a> all I'm asking is that everyone be afforded the same opportunity to correct any mistakes they feel like they made and that we have a meeting to review the superintendent's revised evaluation accordingly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=959.182s">I</a> would. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=959.723s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=961.892s">You</a> know, when we unanimously approve this motion back in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=964.936s">I</a> believe we talked about this but I, you know, the summer is the time when the administration has an opportunity to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=975.202s">really</a> do the work that is required to make meaningful progress in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=980.606s">And</a> so by not letting the superintendent know what our goals are for her before the school year starts, we're also not being fair to her to then expect her to meet goals that we didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=995.739s">outline</a> for her proactively enough for her to be able to meet them and I think, you know, we're here talking about a review and I think everyone is exceedingly trying to be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1004.569s">And</a> I think it's wildly unfair to set goals at a point in the school year, where they <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1012.158s">potentially</a> cannot be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1013.96s">And</a> so that's unfair to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1015.701s">And</a> I think the flip side of that is we as a committee don't put forward the goals that our students need, and that's unfair to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1024.369s">So</a> I do think this is a conversation worth having. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1028.933s">We</a> passed a unanimous resolution about this, and I would like to see us get this done before too much of summer goes by.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1228.546s">Mayor,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1230.327s">I</a> just want to read the motion that we unanimously passed because I think there is some conflation of two things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1238.751s">So</a> be it resolved that the school committee will meet in a committee of the whole to discuss the superintendent goals for the 2022-2023 school year no later than 6-17. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1247.557s">Be</a> it further resolved that the school committee will finalize and approve the superintendent's goals in a regular school committee meeting or a special school committee meeting no later than 9-30-2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1257.481s">So</a> the whole point of this meeting was not for the superintendent to present her goals, it was for us to have a collaborative discussion that could help inform the work she's going to do this summer in anticipation of her bringing her goals to us in September, which was the timeline she requested so. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1277.06s">That's</a> what we unanimously approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1279.701s">And</a> again, like I'm not talking, no one is suggesting that the superintendent needs to put anything together for that meeting, but I thought we were all in agreement that hearing from us about the things that are on our mind would help be informative and rather than being a detraction, but that is where we unanimously agreed not too long ago.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1330.736s">Are</a> you suggesting we won't approve the superintendent's goals until the winter when the school year is almost over?<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_WpieqDvHvyY/2025-06-26_WpieqDvHvyY.html">Community Development Board 06-22-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1951.991s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1952.451s">So</a> I'm not in any way suggesting less professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1957.752s">quite,</a> quite the opposite, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1960.173s">But</a> what I am suggesting is that, you know, we can't, like, we can't, we don't know, like, if you offered 40 things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1969.256s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1970.716s">On</a> a professional development day, like, is there something that is mandatory? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1977.439s">I</a> think usually the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1979.459s">And</a> if it's mandatory, like, what was the compliance rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1982.06s">Like,</a> how many people participated in the class? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1986.322s">And</a> are we like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1988.597s">Are</a> we making mandatory the things that we truly believe are mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1992.421s">But,</a> and I, and I think then there's like the more elective side of the house right with which I love because it gives all our teachers an opportunity to say, this is the thing that I'm dealing with in my specific classroom and so I'm going to go to that I love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2009.552s">which</a> I think makes, because we have such a broad offering, it does make it harder to quantify our outcomes everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2017.1s">But</a> I do think quantifying our outcomes somewhere in the process for some portions of the PD would be really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2026.229s">And</a> I would honestly start with the things that we think of as requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2032.562s">Are</a> they effective and and finding out if they're effective could be about classroom observations, it could be about querying staff 30 1690 days out like there's a variety of ways to be able to check in and say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2048.728s">like</a> this was in fact a good investment because the last thing we want is for to bring in a facilitator who is going to like help with the new math curriculum that basically 30 days out all the teachers say you know what that did not prepare me for what I did in the last 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2067.893s">I</a> think we want to know that because we wouldn't want to do that again and I don't feel I feel like right now that information sort of anecdotal at best and certainly not information that comes to the school committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3645.474s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3645.914s">I</a> think the other, a couple of, I'll say sort of small examples of <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3655.168s">what</a> we're talking about here come to mind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3685.601s">I'm</a> sorry, can you hear me?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5339.132s">So</a> we have a motion to approve the superintendent's evaluation as amended by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin, is that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5353.777s">Yes,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5357.779s">So</a> let's call the roll.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5409.627s">Can</a> we back up? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5411.788s">We</a> have the school committee dates, which we need to vote on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5417.63s">We</a> should not be taking a vote on the calendar because it was already approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5421.811s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5424.573s">Is</a> the motion to approve the school committee dates? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5428.435s">2-2023.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5449.967s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5452.195s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5455.597s">Yes,</a> the motion is to approve the school committee meeting calendar, which is the dates that we will hold regular school committee meetings in the 2022-2023 school year.<h2><a href="../2022-06-13_kZGTRaqmFyM/2022-06-13_kZGTRaqmFyM.html">COW/Budget Hearing June 13, 2022</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1546.625s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1547.026s">I</a> think that would be important because I think it's great that we are capitalizing on our use of ARPA and ESSER and all the grant funding that goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1556.887s">I</a> think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1558.968s">And</a> I don't think the community fully understands how the money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1562.108s">So</a> I think that is critically important, but I guess I'm also, as I read the budget book, it looks like we're <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1571.308s">pretty</a> darn close to exhausting ESSER at the end of FY23. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=1575.434s">So</a> the Great Retrain is sort of effectively over and we won't have that to fall back on next year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2698.777s">As</a> we go into next year, can we have a quarterly accounting of ESSER funds spent and like planned, essentially, so understanding that it's, it is going to change, you know, over time and it should because we want to make sure we're maximizing use the money but it's <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2716.772s">It's</a> not my sense that we're gonna be looking for ways to spend money at the end of the line here, given all that we're having to use it for in this next year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2880.895s">And</a> I do want to say that the feedback that I've heard from the community is that they appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2888.217s">We</a> are having this discussion in a proactive manner on the school committee that we've moved away from past practice, which was dysfunctional and didn't give the community an understanding of what the district felt like it authentically needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2902.42s">So</a> I think that the feedback on that has been good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2905.601s">I</a> think the negative feedback has been about the surprise of how big of a gap we are trying to fill in the month of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2914.379s">to</a> get to a budget that you all can operate against on July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2917.801s">So</a> that has been exceedingly surprising to everybody, including I think most of the people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2925.805s">And</a> I am really concerned that we cannot do that again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2929.447s">Like</a> we're, we're sort of out of options to move stuff around at the very last minute without impacting kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2938.811s">And</a> we can't do this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=2940.492s">And</a> I don't think the community
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4030.536s">I</a> fully support this committee convening to articulate a set of goals that would last a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4039.313s">As</a> it stands right now, there's a really ambitious agenda times seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4044.8s">And</a> it's very difficult if there's no rhyme or reason to how that agenda comes forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4050.286s">And</a> I think it is in part. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4052.936s">know,</a> exacerbating the situation where the administration is telling us we can't do more, we can't do that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4061.063s">And</a> in all fairness, a better plan would allow us all to know what's ahead and be more effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGTRaqmFyM&t=4067.909s">So</a> I'm completely in support.<h2><a href="../2022-06-13_mo_l7RopgYo/2022-06-13_mo_l7RopgYo.html">School Committee Meeting June 13, 2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=359.391s">I</a> also want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=360.192s">Superintendent,</a> can I just stop you for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=362.353s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=363.513s">There</a> is some confusion about the proper Zoom link. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=365.894s">The</a> one on our agenda is apparently not the Zoom link that we are in right now and there are people looking at the Zoom link on the agenda and waiting to get into that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=377.26s">So,</a> can we take a five-minute motion to recess?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1981.676s">I</a> was wondering if the communication and family engagement subcommittee was the more appropriate committee to send this to, given that what we're talking about is parental communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=1997.328s">So</a> just a suggestion that we find the right committee for it to go to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2856.168s">Mayor,</a> can I just ask a couple quick questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2861.07s">On</a> the calendar, the dates in June 13, 14, 15, and 16, say noon dismissal, 6 to 12.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2921.112s">So,</a> so my question is or my request is that at the bottom that the green be listed as tentative dates because those dates will move if there are snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2931.76s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2932.6s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2933.201s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2933.341s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2934.061s">If</a> you're like me and you put all this stuff on your calendar last year when this came out, it just comes as a surprise to you this week that Thursday is in fact not a half day because the dates have shifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2944.909s">So,</a> if it can just be noted as tentative, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2948.391s">so</a> that people understand that there's, like, don't write this down and forget that you wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2953.632s">I</a> think that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2956.873s">And</a> then my other question was whether the dates in yellow were all grades.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3064.396s">Okay,</a> so can we also make a note that the the noon dismissals in yellow just put something like tentative or pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3073.565s">I</a> know there's a lot still going on with this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3078.11s">If</a> we're going to put out a calendar, we're going to create questions if we can't be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3081.594s">So</a> I think we just need to be able to tell people what is <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3084.481s">tentative</a> or pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3085.601s">And</a> then I do think we need to commit to like resolving this particular issue as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3092.863s">Because</a> while high school students can go home by themselves, if we're going to impact kindergartners, they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3098.905s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3099.605s">And</a> we need to make sure that parents have adequate time to plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3102.246s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3104.606s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3715.475s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3718.858s">In</a> past calendars, at least I think this is true, there were start and end times somewhere present on the physical calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3729.648s">So</a> elementary starts at whatever the time is, middle school starts at whatever the time is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3736.114s">One</a> solution that I think would be the most clear for parents who are not <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3741.518s">in</a> the thick of union negotiations is to post school end times with a Wednesday end time of TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3750.867s">So</a> that it's clear that on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, elementary school students are going to get out at 235 and that they need to seek additional information from us at some point in time about the end time for Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3766.68s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3767.765s">sufficiently</a> tells people that this is a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3772.126s">But</a> ultimately, you know, we do have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3775.507s">And</a> the other thing I want to point out is that the school committee did pass a policy that this calendar would be issued in November so that people could plan and obviously negotiation years sort of exacerbate these kinds of things that are otherwise simple to accomplish year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3792.93s">But</a> hopefully we can get on a better schedule for the next school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=3807.068s">Yeah,</a> motion to add school start and end times to the official calendar and notes that Wednesdays are TBD for elementary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7016.652s">Can</a> I just ask a question about science before we move past science, if that's OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7022.417s">On</a> the summary, you mentioned that at grade nine, the exam is representing all science domains. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7028.923s">However,</a> we don't teach that way in high school, so we wouldn't expect this to represent or demonstrate growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7038.592s">I</a> think my question is, if we know that, why are we going to test at ninth grade?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7087.887s">Yeah,</a> I think I'm trying to understand the value of another test if we know that it is not demonstrating growth, because structurally, we're not teaching that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7103.116s">So</a> if we're teaching biology, we would not expect rounded growth in physics, for example, if we're teaching biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7111.041s">Like,</a> nothing's going to change about my knowledge of physics so long as I take biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7116.863s">And</a> so I guess my question is like, why are we testing kids for one more time if we don't, and I'm really genuinely asking, like, what is the value to the instructional staff to know that nothing is changing? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=7134.28s">Could</a> they use that time better to instruct not taking a test?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9592.953s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9593.313s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9595.857s">I</a> am really excited about the data that this provides and the level of objectivity that it can deliver to the district as a whole because we have, as you say, we have lacked that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9613.324s">And</a> I don't think member Hays is suggesting that we didn't or that, you know, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9621.772s">data</a> isn't good or it is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9623.753s">So</a> I'm supportive of an update next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9627.595s">I</a> think one of the questions that I have though is we've had a bunch of discussion about how this information is provided to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9637.181s">And</a> as we end the year, report cards go out, there's map scores, there's standards, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9647.717s">in</a> the report cards that we're evaluating kids against? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9652.098s">And</a> what happens when those two things are in conflict? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9654.938s">So,</a> because at the end of the year, there's very little opportunity for parents to call the teacher and say, hey, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9664.22s">This</a> says everything's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9665.46s">This</a> course says everything's not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9667.181s">Like</a> what happens when there are those discrepancies as we like end the year essentially? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9672.942s">And</a> how's that information reflected to parents?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9823.016s">And</a> I think the other question that I had was really just around like, what can parents expect in the envelope on the last day of school? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9834.062s">And</a> what happens when there's discrepancy? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9835.963s">Like</a> there's just not opportunity at that point for parents to, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9839.847s">talk</a> through those discrepancies because everyone has headed off for summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9844.649s">So</a> I have to assume there are kids where like there is discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9849.251s">They</a> test well, they test badly versus like what the classroom teacher sees. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=9853.753s">How</a> does that reconcile or does it yet?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10060.137s">Yeah,</a> I'm excited for all of those possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10063.039s">And</a> I know that implementing something as significant as this takes time and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10070.137s">And</a> you're literally swimming in data right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10074.301s">So</a> I thank you for all the work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10076.963s">Thank</a> you to the teachers who are taking this on in a really challenging year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10080.907s">The</a> last thing I will say, though, is I do want the administration to be thinking about, is there something that we can take away so that we just aren't testing, testing, testing, testing, testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10091.976s">And</a> I know you all have done some of that work, but I think it bears repeating that we need to continue to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10098.158s">If</a> this is going to be our tool, I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10100.699s">If</a> it can do everything we need it to do, that's even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10105.44s">But</a> I just want to make sure we're not adding this on top of, on top of, on top of, and making school about taking tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10115.063s">Because</a> I think there's a lot, the teachers have so much more to give than being test administrators.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10802.639s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for, A, it's 9.15, and you've been here since five, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10808.505s">I</a> live right here, two minutes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10810.687s">Thanks</a> for sticking with us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10817.231s">But</a> I would say, you know, some of your comments definitely like speak to the fact that this is a process that we're having to move through and that, you know, hopefully the superintendent and her team can can think about ways <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10830.868s">make</a> the administration of this easier and it'll get easier each time for sure but are there other ways the district can provide support to make this easier? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10841.754s">Is</a> there more discussion that can happen as you guys sort of stop drowning in data and start swimming in it to say like what is the reconciliation of this data for particular kids <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10851.719s">where</a> we're seeing something different in the classroom than the data is showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10855.601s">And</a> I think that's like when you talk about that whole child, like that's where the magic can start to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10860.803s">So</a> I am hopeful that, you know, next year will be better than this year in all the ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10869.287s">But</a> I do think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10871.963s">the</a> administration needs to hear from you all about like what is working and what you need support on so that they can provide it so that this can get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10880.193s">So</a> thank you for taking the time to do that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10882.816s">It</a> is appreciated and please keep the feedback coming.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11598.457s">I</a> have been <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11603.251s">flashing</a> back to two years ago when we had a very similar conversation about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11609.235s">And</a> at that time, we were not handling the process the way that we are now where we, we, the two things of what do we, what are we requesting and what are we <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11623.556s">dealing</a> with in reality we're sort of mumbled together, and it made for a chaotic and confusing boat and lots of questions about what happens if we do or we don't approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11634.542s">And,</a> you know, sort of led to a series of questions that frankly still a little bit murky to me about what happens if the council does or doesn't approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11643.547s">Do</a> we, you know, so there's there's a lot of complexity and in the whole entire process but the one thing that I feel good about is that we have sort of bifurcated those two processes today so the community did hear from us, specifically, what we outlined as our strategic needs so that feels better than what we did two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11667.048s">to</a> provide an approval to this still doesn't sit totally right with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11672.849s">So</a> I did some thinking about like, what would it look like to approve such a budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11680.69s">And</a> I've come up with something that I think, at least for me, makes me feel okay about saying yes to this number that's bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11688.912s">So</a> I'm gonna read it and hopefully somebody will like it enough to second it and then we can talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11697.067s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford School Committee approves the fiscal year 2023 budget presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11702.529s">We</a> approve the budget outlined at $68,994,776 and note that it is $2.8 million less than our request of $71.8 million to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11714.833s">Be</a> it also resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere disappointment that we are faced with a budget shortfall in Medford public schools for the second time in just three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11725.014s">The</a> school committee commends the school administration for working in good faith on a budget that outlined our authentic needs in FY23 as our students continue to move on from a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11734.999s">We</a> especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the FY23 budget over this past week with limited impact on students and classrooms as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11747.247s">We</a> had also resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that the actions taken to mitigate this budget shortfall are not sustainable going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11755.977s">We</a> are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford, the Medford City Council and all residents of Medford to ensure that this is the last budget that cuts Medford public schools budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11767.833s">Medford</a> Public Schools represents the future of the city we call home, and we call on city leadership to provide the necessary funding to achieve our aspirations of being the best district we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11778.021s">We</a> implore city leadership to create all future budgets based on the recommendations of the Medford School Committee, where supporting students and investing in our infrastructure and teachers is the top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11789.27s">Be</a> it further resolved that the full text of this motion and the corresponding vote be delivered by noon on Tuesday, June 14th, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11795.607s">2022</a> to the city clerk for distribution to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=11800.191s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12416.135s">there</a> are two places where the word cut appears in the budget, in this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12422.679s">The</a> first says, we especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the FY23 budget over the past week with as limited an impact on students and classrooms as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12437.388s">What</a> I would propose, what I'm happy to amend is that <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12440.974s">uh,</a> the unexpected work to make substantial cuts to the planned FY 23 budget, um, over the last week with as limited an impact as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12451.137s">So</a> we did cut our plan unexpectedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12456.819s">That</a> is a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12457.84s">So</a> that is one place where the word cut occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12460.42s">And</a> I would be happy to add the word planned, um, to the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12464.602s">And</a> I feel like that doesn't degrade the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12468.68s">The</a> second place where cut appears, it says, we are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford and the Medford city council and all residents, all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that cuts Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12488.471s">What</a> I would be happy to do is say that this is the last budget that requires a reduction in services
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12535.279s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12535.579s">That</a> this is the two that we're calling on the mayor, the city of Medford, the Medford city council and all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that requires cuts in, sorry, reductions in service to Medford public schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12670.785s">So,</a> and I think that's a fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12672.986s">So</a> I would also be happy to amend that to say reduction in services supported by the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12681.648s">For</a> anybody who's actually still with us, that's really important because it is not recommended best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12690.29s">Revolving</a> accounts revolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12692.17s">They're</a> not always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12693.23s">We</a> cannot rely on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12694.611s">ESSER</a> will go <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12696.801s">way</a> of the wind within a few short years, maybe sooner, given how heavily we're going to rely on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12702.526s">So</a> we are, in a sense, kicking the can a little bit down the road here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12710.673s">And</a> I think it's really, you know, people will forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12714.036s">And</a> I think the work that we've done is commendable, because we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12718.567s">cutting</a> services in drastic fashion in totality, but instead we are saying our operating budget cannot support the level of service that we feel we need to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12732.714s">And</a> we're lucky right now that we have an alternative and that will not be the case always.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12863.942s">Sure,</a> be it resolved that the Medford school committee approves the fiscal year 2023 budget presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12870.229s">We</a> approve the budget outlined at $68,994,776, and note that it is $2.8 million less than our request of $71.8 million to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12882.623s">We</a> had also resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere disappointment that we are faced with a budget shortfall in Medford public schools for the second time in just three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12893.269s">The</a> school committee commends the school administration for working in good faith on a budget that outlined our authentic needs in FY23 as our students continue to move on from a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12903.675s">We</a> especially thank our finance staff for their quick and unexpected work to make <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12908.709s">substantial</a> cuts to the planned FY 23 budget over the last week with as limited an impact on students and classrooms as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12917.258s">Be</a> it also resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that the actions taken to mitigate this budget shortfall are not sustainable going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12925.506s">We</a> are calling on the mayor, the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12928.109s">the</a> Medford City Council and all Medford residents to ensure that this is the last budget that requires reduction in services supported by the operating budget of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12938.973s">Medford</a> Public Schools represents the future of the city we call home, and we call on city leadership to provide the necessary funding to achieve our aspirations of being the best district we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12952.057s">We</a> implore city leadership to create all future budgets based on the recommendations of the Medford School Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12957.853s">Supporting</a> students and investing in our infrastructure and teachers is the top priority of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=12963.056s">Be</a> it further resolved that the full text of this motion and the corresponding vote will be delivered by noon on Tuesday, June 14th, 2022 to the city clerk for distribution to the Medford City Council.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13544.221s">I</a> mean, I don't know what other people think, but... Can this be added to the agenda when we do the superintendent's evaluation?<h2><a href="../2022-06-06_yrx76KKBXT8/2022-06-06_yrx76KKBXT8.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - June 6, 2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=3999.116s">You</a> all worked with Mr. Zizzo to figure out what the cost for an entire year would be and that was $720 Is that correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4005.426s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4011.092s">I</a> think that is a really reasonable expense for us to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4016.234s">And</a> tonight we are going to talk about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4020.475s">And</a> I would like to ask the administration to think about finding a way for us to fund this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4027.318s">But</a> Violet is my daughter, full disclosure, so I didn't want to be the person to make that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4032.58s">If</a> any of my colleagues would like to help me out.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4108.109s">Motion</a> to revert back to the regular order of business.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6525.03s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6526.431s">Is</a> the consultant's engagement complete?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6531.475s">Is</a> the equity process organization's engagement with us complete?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6549.308s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6551.775s">I</a> want to start by saying I'm completely supportive of this work, but this is not what I expected to receive at the end of a paid engagement from a consultant who is an expert in this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6574.082s">So</a> I want to be clear that we asked for a couple of really important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6578.325s">One</a> is a roadmap of how we would go about implementing all of these recommendations in some sort of sequential order that makes sense for our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6588.504s">I</a> don't see that here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6590.827s">We</a> can't do this with just a list of things like it's, we are not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6597.736s">So</a> my expectation was that there would be a clear roadmap that reflected our priorities and our realities. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6605.646s">and</a> that's missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6607.306s">I</a> think we also specifically asked the consultant for commentary around our wage scales and whether they were supportive or not supportive of our goals around hiring and retention by POC staff.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6628.931s">Okay,</a> I would like to see the full report before we continue to engage this consultant further because <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6634.672s">this</a> isn't enough for us to act on, as far as I can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6639.754s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=6640.714s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8255.667s">A</a> couple things, I'm shocked and disappointed that it's June 6th and we're just learning about this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8263.869s">This</a> is the first time I've seen this number in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8278.352s">And</a> Mr. Murphy, that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8281.65s">The</a> school committee has done its work. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8283.871s">We've</a> been proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8285.472s">We</a> have outlined and articulated very thoughtfully for the city about what we need to help our kids recover from this pandemic and to run a school district that we all deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8297.178s">We</a> have done our work here in the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8299.719s">I</a> am extraordinarily disappointed that our city couldn't come to the table sooner than this to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8307.023s">Two</a> years ago, I voted no on a budget, which feels a little bit like deja vu at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8314.45s">And</a> in my comments, I said Medford needs to step in and say that our kids deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8320.776s">I've</a> heard from folks for weeks about the things they see as critical and the truth is it's all critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8328.683s">The</a> how have more money is not the purview of this committee, but I am proud of the work that we've done and continue to do for the last three years to shine a light on our needs as a district in this in this joint memo which we issued a couple years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8341.913s">Our</a> needs are now well documented and clear and they have been for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8346.116s">As</a> a resident, I will support any and all actions by our mayor to prioritize schools and raise revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8352.418s">She</a> has my full support should she and the council determine that a proposition two and a half override is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8359.001s">It</a> is my hope that every person who has voiced a concern or will voice a concern about this budget or any other budget cut that we have to make will stand with our mayor on this as well when she's ready to raise revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8371.645s">We</a> can't continue to say that this is just going to be a lean year and maybe next year is going to be a lean year like we have to prioritize the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8381.629s">And</a> I think the city is ready to do that and I would ask the mayor to step up to that plate and do better.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=9183.956s">Was</a> it six?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=9852.445s">Can</a> I just add to that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=9854.366s">Can</a> I just add to that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10039.686s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10041.527s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10042.867s">I</a> just had a few questions and I wanted to make sure that we're on the same page about some of the numbers.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10064.966s">Okay,</a> so I wanna start by saying, I agree with you that Medford has room to prioritize education. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10074.951s">This</a> committee can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10077.938s">So</a> all we can do is ask and I feel like we're doing that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10083.92s">So</a> we're with you, I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10086.581s">I</a> think that the city needs to do more for education and we're ready to spend it as soon as that materializes. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10093.344s">Having</a> said that, a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10095.804s">906962</a> equals roughly a 2.25% cost of living increase <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10103.285s">from</a> the FY22 budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10106.566s">My</a> question is, does that leave funds available for all the other staff who have unnegotiated contracts?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10133.177s">Okay,</a> so we put all of that in there, great and we included that, and that comes out to 2.25% comes out to 2.25% calculator. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10141.464s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10143.105s">Second</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10145.027s">I</a> saw the press release from <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10149.352s">Secretary</a> of Education Cardona, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10152.773s">So</a> it's a press release and it talks at a high level. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10155.595s">My</a> understanding of the regulations that have been promulgated from DESE provide a lot of qualifiers about how ESSER money can be used and explicitly using it sort of to straight pay for COLA is like not in the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10170.181s">Now</a> that's not to say ESSER can't be used in various ways to compensate <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10175.202s">teachers</a> for things related to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10178.028s">But</a> my understanding of the DESE regulations is that <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10180.922s">they</a> go well deeper than the press release from Secretary Cardona. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10185.023s">Is</a> that your understanding of the DESI regs as well?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10249.583s">Okay,</a> couple other questions I just want to make sure again I'm understanding the numbers so 2.25% is what the 2022 budget can bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10255.147s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10255.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10261.178s">You</a> all just sat, I know you just sat through a really ugly presentation about our budget for next year where there's a $1.4 million shortfall.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10269.86s">So</a> that picture gets worse next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10272.52s">And</a> it sounds like it's going to get worse the year after that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10404.822s">Stand</a> up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10508.936s">So</a> just, can I ask one more question and then I will cede the floor to somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10514.938s">I</a> know that as part of the discussion, we are not, <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10521.109s">in</a> the same place about wage colas, which is why you're here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10527.432s">And</a> I just want to, I do want to say as much as I love hanging out with you all on Monday nights, I do care deeply about the children of this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10534.495s">And</a> that is why I do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10535.876s">And</a> I think my colleagues would share that sentiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10538.657s">So</a> I love hanging out with you all on Monday nights, but I also care about the 4,000 kids in this district and I'm not okay with the cuts we're going to be asked to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10548.821s">I'm</a> not okay with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10550.622s">I'm</a> not okay with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10552.764s">I've</a> never been okay with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10553.965s">I</a> voted no on the last budget that cut too deep and I will do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10561.906s">These</a> six people can't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10564.147s">So</a> how do we get to this $8 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10567.429s">How</a> did we get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10568.43s">All</a> of a sudden, we're talking like the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10571.632s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10571.812s">Douglas,</a> I did want to say, I know that we're not in the same place about these wage increases, but the district has proposed a way that allows us to use ESSER funds that is permissible under the DESE regulation to provide stipends <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10591.673s">to</a> your teachers for two of the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10595.797s">And</a> I know that's not, let me finish please. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10602.984s">I</a> know that isn't ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10604.706s">I</a> recognize fully its limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10607.568s">However,</a> we cannot use that money if it is not a defensible and permissible use. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10613.634s">And</a> that may be <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10615.936s">the</a> compromise we have to think about and explore in the right now when we're faced with a $1.4 million surprise deficit here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10627.642s">We</a> should do lots of things as a community to fix that so we don't have to do this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10632.645s">And</a> as I said, I'm ready to pound the pavement for that two and a half override that is gonna fix this structurally. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10640.129s">But</a> until then, I would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10643.331s">the</a> district, think about how to use that money in a permissible fashion to with the proposal that's on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10652.037s">And</a> I would ask you all to think about how we can make that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10655.8s">Because</a> I'm it's if it was my pocketbook, it would be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10661.965s">I</a> we cannot this committee cannot spend money that we do not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10665.707s">So</a> I want to make sure that you all know <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10669.113s">We,</a> I recognize fully that that proposal is not ideal, I get it, but there's nothing ideal about this situation that we are in and I'm terribly sorry about it and I really do hope the city can find a way to do better as we go forward because we can't we can't keep having this conversation like we're, we're out, we're out of things to cut.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=11663.387s">Motion</a> to accept the first reading.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=11710.533s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=11715.803s">Aye.</a> <h2><a href="../2022-05-25_QjB8-1pZ1Vk/2022-05-25_QjB8-1pZ1Vk.html">Rules and Policy Subcommittee Meeting 5.25.2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=374.334s">Can</a> you make it a little bit bigger?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=675.973s">Paul?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=676.973s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=677.213s">I</a> was wondering if Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=678.214s">Galusti</a> wanted to share some of her thoughts about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1624.346s">I</a> was curious if you could tell us <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1628.782s">in</a> summary, specifically what the Supreme Judicial Court ruled, because I feel like we're trying to talk ourselves into doing something that's explicitly the opposite of what the Supreme Judicial Court told us was permissible.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1715.55s">The</a> clear, unambiguous, and mandatory language of Master in Law, Chapter 71, Section 82, protecting the right of public school students to freedom of expression admits no exception or limitation for arguably vulgar, lewd, or offensive language absent a showing of disruption within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1736.204s">So</a> there is no- Offensive isn't acceptable either. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1741.868s">Yeah,</a> there is no exception to limit <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1746.235s">arguably</a> vulgar, lewd, or offensive language.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1814.629s">And</a> I guess from my standpoint, what would constitute disruption at the elementary level is gonna be really quite different than what's gonna constitute disruption at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1826.879s">So</a> I think, at the same time, I take exception to the overuse of the idea that clothing is disruptive and I'm not in favor of the actions that I've seen happen under the guise of disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1843.492s">So</a> I wonder if a I wonder if we should circle back to this at the end of the meeting and make our way through the rest of the comments for discussion but but also think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1856.709s">you</a> know, maybe there's a separate bullet about profanity that says that it is discouraged and, you know, that the school administration has the right to restrict it in the event that it is disruptive to the school environment with some examples of, you know, what might be permissible in an elementary school versus a high school or something, you know, something that sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=1883.28s">draws</a> that line out a little bit, but doesn't make it such that, like happens today, everybody gets to decide what they want the dress code to be and enforce it as they see fit.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2330.701s">Remember,</a> so I just added to the chat, maybe a suggestion that could work.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2363.848s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2364.809s">Yeah,</a> and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2367.583s">Some</a> of the things I was trying to navigate around was this sort of like arbitrary use of the word disruptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2376.053s">And</a> there's somewhat no way around that but address, you know, sort of addressing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2383.22s">the</a> line of demarcation is a disruption to the learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2386.822s">It's</a> not just that you roll into school with FCK on your shirt and that at that point on a case-by-case basis, school leaders will deal with the disruptions on a case-by-case basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2399.467s">I</a> think that in my mind sufficiently addresses Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2402.969s">Galussi's</a> concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2407.208s">disruptions</a> being quite different at the elementary level, like FCK is gonna be disrupted at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=2414.292s">So</a> I think that provides, you know, some guardrails without being like flagrantly in opposition with what the case law has provided.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3000.948s">wondering,</a> and I don't know if this is like a fully formed idea, but I mean, what we're dancing around is the difference between boys bathing suits and girls bathing suits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3012.41s">Like</a> no one cares that Paul's son wears his swim trunks to school, but what we're really saying is what we're worried about is girls wearing bathing suits to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3023.593s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3027.3s">As</a> I was thinking through this, I went back to read and one thing we could do is say, in the bullet that says that students may not wear clothing that intentionally show private parts, clothing must cover private parts in opaque material, maybe it's intentionally show private parts or undergarments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3054.179s">And</a> the reason I hesitate to say that is because I don't wanna hear stories about people being sent home or dress coded because their bra straps are showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3065.381s">That's</a> not what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3067.441s">So</a> I like really hesitate to like even say this, but I think what we're trying to say is we don't wanna see your underwear. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3075.783s">I</a> feel like that's reasonable and we need to find a way to work that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3080.663s">And</a> I think bathing suit can sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3084.321s">be</a> swept in if we can adopt some language about not wanting to see people's underwear.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3188.046s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3189.427s">That's</a> why I was wondering if talking about intentionally showing undergarments sufficiently like, <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3199.571s">covers</a> us without having to dabble in this arbitration about bathing suits.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3574.945s">Yeah,</a> I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3577.787s">Jane,</a> I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3578.707s">I</a> do think that is a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3583.87s">So</a> I wonder if back to the bullet about and, you know, intentionally showing private parts, that that is not allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3594.476s">Maybe</a> it's like a substantial <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3602.302s">like</a> fraction of undergarments or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3605.223s">Like</a> I wanna clearly make sure we're not dress coding girls based on their bra straps, but I generally don't wanna see people's undergarments in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3618.248s">So</a> I think thinking about a notion that the majority of somebody's undergarments are covered, the vast majority seems reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3630.663s">So</a> I don't know if there's a way for us to say, intentionally show private parts or substantial portions of undergarments, or maybe we just say, or undergarments, and we say, you know, this does not include bra straps. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3653.214s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3653.574s">Maybe</a> we just like really name it so that there can be no confusion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=3708.804s">I</a> think that sounds reasonable as an addition to qualify this discussion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4168.659s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4174.537s">I</a> feel like we went down a really strange rabbit hole right there that I have take a lot of exception to when I think of a team approach, I don't think that that ever means like promoting and perpetuating. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4188.851s">sexism.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4189.811s">And</a> that's what I hear in that statement, although well intended so I would encourage the administration to revisit the input, how they approach dress code as they implement this policy because I think the point of this policy was to take all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4208.688s">implicit</a> sexism out of the mix and off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4214.132s">And</a> if the administration continues to deal with dress code matters in a way that's counter to that, then we're doing our students a disservice as we talk about equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/QjB8-1pZ1Vk&t=4228.423s">So</a> that neither here nor there, I did wanna do a time check, it is 10 past five.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2385.954s">Mr.</a> Murphy, can you just go back to category D to the first slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2389.897s">I</a> think you moved too quickly through that for me to take that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2394.94s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2395.881s">I</a> just wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to look at that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2419.245s">Okay,</a> thank you, Mr. Murphy for that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2423.41s">Are</a> there questions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2425.632s">If</a> you guys just want to raise your hands, we can move through it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2429.055s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2470.051s">And</a> are you going to put that in the chat?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2494.318s">You</a> can go ahead, Mr. Murphy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2623.469s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2624.23s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2942.191s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2943.411s">Member</a> Kreatz?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3350.065s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3361.375s">Okay,</a> so the motion on the floor by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Mustone, is I move that we submit a request for A, B, and D to the municipal government in the sum of $72.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3373.999s">Further,</a> in the event that the state of Massachusetts does not fund school meals as they are presently considering, the district will proceed with free meals nonetheless and make a request to the municipal government for supplemental funding to cover the cost of continuing our free meal policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3392.753s">Are</a> there other questions from the committee on the motion or on the deck?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3443.667s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3444.528s">Six</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3447.029s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3451.712s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3481.028s">Yes,</a> please do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3666.833s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3667.514s">Member</a> McLaughlin, did you have another question or is your hand?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3707.282s">And</a> Mr. Murphy, correct me if I have this wrong, but the next steps, this is our request to the municipal government, which effectively will go to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3719.488s">As</a> the mayor works on her overall city budget to present to the city council, she will have a well-informed understanding of what this committee has deemed priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3730.133s">And</a> she has been part of those discussions all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3733.254s">And</a> then we will, <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3736.484s">await</a> a budget approval from the city council to know what our allocation specifically will be come July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3745.889s">And</a> based on that allocation, which hopefully is everything we've asked for, we would adopt, we would have, convene another meeting, take a vote to adopt the municipal, to adopt the school committee budget based on the municipal appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3762.637s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3943.545s">And</a> Mr. Murphy, has the mayor advised you of the schedule of releasing her budget and the council's review of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3953.189s">Has</a> that been established yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3954.29s">Are</a> you aware?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3985.014s">Great,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3990.576s">Awesome,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4314.688s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4315.689s">Member</a> Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4316.99s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4318.611s">Motion</a> adjourned by Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4320.653s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4321.793s">Seconded</a> by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4323.775s">Member</a> Rossell, will you call the roll?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4339.851s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=4342.47s">The</a> affirmative one.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_HK3G1-bENjA/2025-06-26_HK3G1-bENjA.html">Community Development Board 05-16-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5237.796s">Hi,</a> Andrea, this is Christy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5239.278s">I'd</a> like to ask just a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5242.241s">I</a> just want to thank our fellow board members for the detailed questions they asked and I concur with a lot of their statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5250.248s">This</a> may be a question for the city, but in terms of thinking of the longer term plan for the multiple parcels that are coming on the market in this area, is there any thought giving to <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5263.633s">how</a> this first development and future developments may start to connect in the future and allow possibilities for connection between the parcels as you think of it as a possibility to become like a future campus? <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5283.485s">Anybody</a> want to take that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5405.144s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5406.825s">In</a> terms of the community benefits I noticed there's communities flex space. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5413.19s">Would</a> you mind explaining what your vision and intent is for that space and the community access to that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5531.147s">Yeah,</a> no, I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5533.608s">I</a> think having a space that allows for intentional interactions with the community for educational purposes, for training purposes, even around workforce development, but really leveraging this as the first major life science building in the city of Medford and making people aware and having access to the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5558.613s">and</a> a better understanding of what goes on in this building is a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5565.437s">I</a> would just like to reinforce the request or suggestion for renderings and perspectives of how pedestrians will really experience the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5577.884s">They</a> will never experience it from up top, so really understanding how the pedestrian engages with the building at the street level. <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5587.957s">would</a> be much appreciated.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5613.816s">Great,</a> thanks.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5618.427s">One</a> final comment I have just reading through Medford Historic Commission comments is, are there any concerns from your end on some of their comments and how that may affect how you move forward with maintaining the design of the building or addressing the impacts that they identified?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HK3G1-bENjA&t=5724.596s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7947.807s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7949.769s">I</a> think my question is really about the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7954.972s">So</a> I think based on what you've outlined here, we will need to take a vote to send a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7966.401s">Is</a> it one of those numbers on the final summary page? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7969.743s">Is</a> that what you're suggesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7971.585s">And</a> I think my question is, when can we do that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8376.53s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8377.05s">In</a> terms of the questions about the presentation of the information around our request, I think, I don't know, I feel like I'm of the mind that the budget book in its prior form may be more appropriate when we are talking about, down the line when we are talking about how <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8398.23s">We</a> will implement the city's appropriation, then in the right now I think my fear about putting out a big giant book right now is. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8411.147s">those</a> people who are interested in like digging in and thinking about what's happening it's misleading like everything you need to know about the strategic priorities really can be summed up in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8422.65s">I</a> would say making sure that you know when we decide on you know which combination of items belongs in our request that we should absolutely <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8434.994s">make</a> the City Council aware of how much ESSER money we also plan to use and what those priorities are on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8443.645s">And</a> I would say make, you know, make it clear on that same page what the <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8454.037s">the</a> free lunch costs could be so that they're clear about what our request is, what an additional request might be if the legislature does not come through with their free meal request, and then what other money we're planning to use out of our ESSER funds and what that brings our ESSER balance to so that they have that full picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8477.38s">I</a> think if one slide could tell that story along with the details of what the things are that we're saying we think are going to go up in fixed costs and then the strategic priorities, I do think this presentation is a more concise way to tell the entire story of what our request is and that the details of that budget book almost seem more appropriate when we're saying, specifically, we have this amount of money, specifically, this is how we're going to spend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8505.127s">I</a> feel like doing that right now is <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8508.821s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8510.302s">just</a> too early and I think it could just send people sort of down the rabbit hole without much value and really trying to understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8518.847s">And</a> I guess the other question I had was you said something about our June 6th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8523.31s">Does</a> that mean you're not thinking that we need to send this request to City Hall sooner than June 6th? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8528.633s">I</a> guess I was thinking there was some urgency to us getting our request finalized so that the request in its <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8538.04s">sort</a> of unfettered form can go to the municipal government and give them enough time to do the work that they need to do on the city side and then through the council and then to get back to us all before June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8551.347s">So</a> I guess I was sort of expecting we might need to meet before June 6th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8571.157s">So</a> I, I am wondering if the rest of the committee sort of shares. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8577.577s">Um,</a> my thoughts about the timing of our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8582.319s">Maybe,</a> maybe we meet next Monday to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8585.0s">And</a> then that the budget books would wait with our final hearing, which is statutorily required into June when we have our appropriation number.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8645.88s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=8646.421s">So</a> I am wondering what my colleagues, my other colleagues think about the timing of this presentation and the changes that I suggested versus what we'll ultimately do in June.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9178.957s">Mayor,</a> before we move on, can I just ask one more question? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9182.6s">Oh,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9183.0s">One</a> more question, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9185.462s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9186.322s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9187.783s">When</a> I'm thinking about, you know, I think with the question we're being asked to think about is like, which sort of combination of these things are we going to send as the component of our request? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9201.073s">I</a> think as I looked at those lists, I'm sort of like, I feel like my brain is heading towards saying A plus B plus D, but I would also say there may be some things in D that I might sort of throw into E to make that D slightly smaller than it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9223.908s">That's</a> sort of where my head is at in terms of what the request might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9229.913s">And</a> we can definitely talk about that at the next meeting, but I just didn't, I wanted to share that with my colleagues and on the floor in terms of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9240.467s">just</a> trying to have a framework of thinking about all like there's, you know, any very, any, you know, number of options of how we could put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9250.313s">And</a> I just thought I might put that out there for us to be able to start somewhere.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9665.266s">Okay,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9666.227s">So</a> the Secretary would. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9669.449s">send</a> it out to us, make sure that there's enough time for us to complete, compile, just like we have done in years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9675.933s">And</a> I assume that if member Hays needs to be read into the process that I'm happy to do that or member Ruseau could do it as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9719.587s">I'm</a> fine with that amendment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9881.643s">Mayor,</a> could I respond to that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9888.788s">So</a> I think, you know, in thinking about the timeline, <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9892.911s">always</a> run out of time to do all these things at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9896.522s">And</a> as I was <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9900.035s">discussing</a> this with the superintendent back and forth, you know, I originally was really wanting us to agree on goals between now and the end of June, so that in my mind, the administrative team can spend the summer thinking about how to implement those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9918.704s">And</a> the superintendent did aptly point out that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9925.087s">there</a> is a lot of considerable amount of data that comes in over the summer and that you know we we'd really be best positioned to provide some space to allow that that set of information and data that's going to come in over the summer to help guide the the ultimate and finalized goals that we hold her accountable for which I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9945.968s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9948.023s">what</a> this does is sort of change the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9950.264s">So</a> in the past, the superintendent brings us a draft of her goals and then, you know, it's usually sometime in the fall, the year has already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9959.207s">There's</a> not, you know, there's an opportunity for us to sort of tweak here and there, but there isn't really a great opportunity for her to be able to hear from the committee in a wholesale way what we want to see the goals be. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9975.332s">So</a> I think what this does is say, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9978.033s">Between</a> now and June, the school committee will have a discussion, that's it, we will have a committee of the whole, where we will talk about the kinds of things that we want the superintendent to take into consideration as from a goals perspective, as she heads into the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9996.287s">so</a> that she can then pair that with the data and the work that her academic team is doing, but that we not finalize or ask her to put anything in draft until September. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10005.056s">But</a> I think it's critically important that she hear from us proactively about what we think those goals should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10011.722s">And</a> that piece has always sort of been missing in our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10016.167s">So</a> I think this, <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10017.788s">adding</a> this now gives us an opportunity to do that without really expecting the superintendent to draft or document anything along the way between now and the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10029.392s">But</a> really, I think it's more an opportunity for her to be able to hear from us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10183.409s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10183.97s">This</a> is this is the list of policies that we talked about at our last subcommittee meeting that didn't make its way onto the agenda formally last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10192.176s">But</a> these are the policies there. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10194.357s">As</a> you can see, there are quite a number of them are at that circle attendance and truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10199.621s">So</a> the my request here is that we that we send this to the <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10204.744s">communications</a> and family engagement subcommittee so that they can look at this work in tandem with the work that we are doing over there on our communications around attendance to families.<h2><a href="../2022-05-10_k23Jlj002f0/2022-05-10_k23Jlj002f0.html">Special School Committee Meeting:  Budget May 10, 2022</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=1880.343s">Yeah,</a> on the registrar, if I am recalling correctly, this is a position that was eliminated when we made a serious cut to the budget for school year 2021 and has not yet been restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=1896.748s">Is</a> that correct?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2196.516s">Member</a> Graham, did you have your hand up still? <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2200.096s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2201.036s">I</a> just wanted to ask the administration to consider how we could move from a really non-functional and untenable situation at the elementary level library to something that demonstrates progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2220.0s">a</a> 0.6 FTE spread across four buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2223.261s">Like</a> she could be superwoman and there would be next to nothing that she could reasonably accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2231.645s">So,</a> and I've watched this as a volunteer myself since long before I was on the school committee, there's a whole host of like missed opportunity in terms of educational opportunity for kids that would obviously need <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2247.973s">dedicated</a> support, you know, dedicated individuals at like a 1.0 level in terms of like when you look at library best practice, but I also want us to think about the fact that the current structure is totally unsustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2265.922s">So</a> progress, even if it's not all of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2272.141s">could</a> be meaningful and I also share the concerns and commentary around needing a curriculum and an approach for staff when we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2287.89s">It</a> cannot be homegrown, it cannot be pieced together by strapped resources inside the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2295.314s">There</a> is content out there <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2300.367s">Um,</a> and I think we, if we're going to invest, we need to think about a curriculum that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=2306.168s">Um,</a> supports the investment as well at some point in time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5550.741s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5553.663s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5554.103s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5554.323s">Pelosi,</a> I thought that, and maybe this is just my, I guess I'm just surprised to see that we're investing in professional development around dibbles, given that we are extensively testing kids with MAP and <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5573.824s">MCAS</a> and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5576.107s">So</a> I guess I'm just trying to understand like where dibbles fits in and is it based on the science of reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5581.492s">Like</a> we've got all these things happening and like, when is too much assessment too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5588.9s">I</a> guess is my question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5660.748s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5661.708s">And</a> have we explicitly outlawed the use of the tools that do not support things yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=5671.052s">Or</a> when do we plan to do that yet?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6682.535s">You</a> are going to be wrong, no matter which way. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6689.039s">Before</a> we talk about this again, can this slide be updated to include like, if we were talking about the spend of category C, D, E, F, like what would those numbers be so that we can be clear? <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6706.395s">And</a> then I think, you know, as we think about like the, what we're trying to send up in terms of our request, <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6717.052s">I</a> guess I would like to personally spend some time just to understand if we're just talking about categories A and B in play here, there were a lot of things in those other categories that I think are strategically aligned and are meaningful, and how do we make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6737.671s">you</a> know, that those things don't get left on the cutting room floor in our request without a lot of thought.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6811.637s">I</a> would think the librarians at the elementary school would be a good example of something that couldn't succeed without the right supports structurally. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6824.645s">Okay,</a> I think that was my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6826.306s">I</a> just want to make sure that it's really clear, you know, however the categories land, what are the collective impacts of the categories so that as a committee, we have an opportunity to agree, disagree, like move things around, et cetera, as we have that final discussion and send our request to the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=6849.38s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7730.83s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7732.75s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7734.131s">Um,</a> I just listening to the questions from my colleagues, I wanted to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7741.905s">reflect</a> back like for three years, this is my third, I think third budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7747.068s">And</a> I think when I started, there was sort of a silent understanding that the administration was never going to like ask for more than what the mayor was prepared to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7762.556s">And</a> over the course of the last three years, like I think as a committee, we've tried to really press the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7770.06s">in</a> various ways to tell us what really is needed for the upcoming school year to meet our objectives, to serve students, et cetera, in a more authentic way than had been done in past administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7787.495s">I</a> think that has looked a little bit different each year, but I think we are finally getting to some alignment where our strategic plan <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7797.063s">which</a> can and should be a living, breathing document, can guide priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7803.986s">And</a> so some of these things that have been like mainstays of how we do budgeting, like these, like many, many, many hours of department head report, department heads providing very similar year to year conversation about what happens in their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7818.814s">I</a> think we can sort of leave those behind and feel good that this is one of those changes that's good <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7825.967s">in</a> terms of the process that we're going through, because there can be alignment, a strategic plan actually exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7834.693s">And</a> so therefore we can align to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7836.774s">That's</a> really never been the case really before this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7841.257s">So</a> I'm really happy with the progress we're making, particularly because it's always been my <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7848.805s">opinion</a> and belief that it's our job to tell the community what Medford Public Schools needs to allow every kid to reach its full potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7857.67s">And</a> with the full recognition that that may or may not always align with all the other forces at play that really we have no control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7868.657s">But</a> it's our job to be able to say this is really what we think we need for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7873.12s">So</a> I am glad that we're making progress on <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7877.302s">a</a> better process that's more aligned, that is transparent as well because we are focused on the alignment to that strategic plan which does provide transparency to these objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7891.806s">And</a> I do think it's always important to hear from the people who are doing the work and we've found a way to sort of release them from <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7900.688s">many</a> hours of these meetings, but still collect their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7903.61s">So</a> I think we're continuing to move in the right direction around this process, at least for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=7911.896s">Even</a> though it is different, I think it's one of those like, this change is good.<h2><a href="../2022-05-09_UKy15P8nAPo/2022-05-09_UKy15P8nAPo.html">Special School Committee Meeting:  Budget May 9, 2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=277.904s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3298.593s">Mayor,</a> before we move on, can I just ask a quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=3303.081s">Mr.</a> Murphy, can you just flip back to the categorization slide for me real quick?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4597.6s">Can</a> I just ask a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4599.701s">In</a> past member Hays question just made me think about one of the things in prior budget books that would be helpful grounding for us all which is the population of students at each school because I <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4615.332s">It's</a> not my recollection that the McGlynn is the biggest elementary school in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4620.337s">And</a> then I found myself sort of thinking like, do I have that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4623.98s">Can</a> I shuffle through my papers and find it? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4625.462s">So</a> I think that would be helpful to make sure we're all operating with the same enrollment set.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4636.492s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4636.933s">Galussi,</a> can you <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4639.95s">Do</a> you have any like brief rundown of the size of the different schools at the elementary level?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4759.684s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4760.144s">I</a> do think that is a really excellent point from Member McLaughlin and hoping that in the budget books, we can also, to some degree, describe some of the special ed and language-based classrooms that are happening in our barrack, because all the schools have different programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4779.793s">they</a> do have different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4781.334s">I</a> think it's really important to be able to describe what happens in each building in a substantive way, even though that in itself is not gonna like paint the perfect picture of like who needs what, when, but I think just some commitment to like telling us like from a staffing perspective, what's going on in each building and what the student populations <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4805.18s">that</a> we support there are, I think would be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=4807.46s">So</a> if we could just make sure that's in the final budget book, that would be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7919.33s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7921.132s">If</a> I recall back, maybe even like before the pandemic, when we were talking about a pilot, we did a pilot way back when, and a big central part of that was like tracking participation to help inform like whether we would qualify for some program or another after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7945.557s">And</a> it was this like predated Mr. Murphy for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7951.415s">I</a> think I heard you say you can't size this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7955.137s">Is</a> that because we're not tracking or because we lack data from the city in the revolving account? <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7962.36s">Like</a> why can't we size this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8059.217s">I</a> think also before your time led by the mayor, the entire city signed a hunger-free pledge and advocates from the task force, I don't know exactly like the right term to use for the people actually trying to make sure that we politicians keep good to our commitment to make Medford hunger-free have reached out and asked us, asked several of us about <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8089.136s">you</a> know, what, you know, what Medford Public Schools, you know, how Medford Public Schools fits into all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8098.819s">And</a> what I have relayed to them is that I don't think there's any one on the committee who is not interested in proceeding as we have stated in our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8109.122s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8112.002s">you</a> know, that is all contingent on funding that comes from the mayor and the city in terms of how we spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8120.027s">And</a> in lean times, we start to have to pit things like feeding kids lunch against administrators and that that's like never a good situation to be in because everybody loses when the community has to have that <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8137.317s">kind</a> of debate about money as it relates to basic necessity and needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8145.58s">So</a> I say all that to say there are people who probably are or may not be on this call who are watching at the city level to make sure that the city keeps good on its promises that were unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8162.786s">And</a> Mayor, I don't know if they've reached out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8164.726s">I</a> know there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8167.065s">or</a> it sounds like there is actual activity happening on that task force that the school committee has not been made aware of, which I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8174.287s">I</a> also think the school committee needs to like be looped in somehow in a formal way, which I think was the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8181.669s">But</a> overall, I think as we proceed, I think we do need to at least understand what it would cost to do this thing that we've all promised to do really rather excitedly and unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8197.048s">at</a> multiple times actually over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8199.509s">So</a> I also think based on what I am hearing that the outlook is good and favorable from a statewide perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8210.011s">So</a> I am of the mind that like, I want us to be ready with an understanding of the impact in case that goes South, but that I'm actually not overly worried that it will go South. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8223.374s">I</a> just want us to be prepared to be able to decide <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8227.531s">what</a> the implications are for us if it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8232.857s">But</a> I know that's a lot of work and a bunch of information you may or may not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8237.939s">So</a> I don't know how best to proceed with that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8357.183s">Yeah,</a> and I understand and appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8363.524s">I</a> do think the other thing this committee needs perhaps more education on whether from the Food Security Task Force or somebody else is <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8376.807s">The</a> value of providing free lunch has less to do with feeding a kid whose parents may be able to afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8385.756s">It</a> is not about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8387.858s">It</a> is about opening up access to the kids who desperately need to be able to eat lunch at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8396.537s">for</a> a whole variety of reasons who may or may not qualify under the states program, whose parents may or may not want to qualify them under the free lunch programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8407.061s">And</a> when it becomes a normalized part of the process, everybody wins. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8413.604s">And</a> when every kid in school isn't hungry, <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8417.005s">every</a> kid in school benefits from all the kids in school being able to focus on learning and not worrying about being hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8423.529s">And</a> I'm like far from the expert in the room on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8427.151s">I</a> know there are people who feel way more passionately than I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8429.413s">I</a> think my suggestion for the superintendent, and I can follow up with you in an email, is that we find somebody from the Food Security Task Force to engage with us to make sure we're all on the same page about <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=8442.237s">um,</a> this program and how it fits into the master plan for the excited declaration that we made about being hunger free here in Medford.

href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=406.431s">We</a> had a good discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=407.951s">A</a> couple of things that I thought were worth pointing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=411.012s">We</a> are required to send a letter once students miss a certain number of days, I believe it's 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=416.293s">As</a> a district, we choose to send a letter at 5, 10 and 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=421.994s">And</a> we agreed in the meeting that we would be working on some revised drafts so that those letters could be more consistent with <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=429.776s">The</a> notion that part of what we're doing, especially at five absences, is trying to make sure the families know that we're here, we care, we wanna work with them, we wanna understand what the challenges are so that their students can get back to learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=443.059s">Same</a> thing at 10 is really to sort of reinforce that we're still here, we're still invested in making sure the student has what they need to be successful in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=451.862s">And</a> then 15 being sort of that third letter with a similar touch, but obviously an escalating concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=458.243s">So</a> we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=459.823s">The</a> administration is going to draft copies of those new letters that we will hopefully be able to get into production, into the flow of communication by next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=472.105s">And</a> thanks to Megan Fidler-Carey, who's our Director of Family and Community Engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=477.606s">She</a> attended the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=479.567s">She</a> talked a lot about how the work that the re-engagement specialists are doing is really aligned with some of this work that we're trying to do around <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=487.408s">family</a> communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=489.31s">The</a> other letter that we talked about was what I'll say is the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year, which is traditionally been penned by District Attorney Marion Ryan that talks about the requirement for students to come to school, and it goes into a fair bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=506.128s">legal</a> conversation around what the law says about how you must send your child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=512.049s">And</a> it does cover in some detail via a lot of legalese the consequences of not sending your child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=518.891s">And</a> we also agreed at that time that we would look to redraft that letter with some additional outreach to understand what the requirements are around that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=530.033s">The</a> reason that we'll do that is because that's the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=534.958s">So</a> it's, you know, the first letter families should be receiving about attendance from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=540.443s">And</a> we want to make sure that the letter actually reflects what our policies are and that the letter reflects the approach that we try to take to family and community engagement in a proactive manner rather than being focused on text from Mass General Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=558.302s">So</a> that was topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=559.906s">Topic</a> number two, the other thing we did talk about with topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=566.775s">Although</a> I don't see it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=571.618s">We</a> did talk about the fact that there are five attendance policies associated with our policy handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=578.982s">I</a> don't see it officially on the agenda, so I will submit it officially for next week so that you all can vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=584.004s">But</a> the recommendation of the subcommittee that's reflected in the minutes is that the committee will, in addition to drafting those letters, actually go through and review the attendance and truancy policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=595.03s">so</a> that they are consistent and hopefully don't take five to actually get the point across about attendance and truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=603.036s">So</a> that was topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=605.318s">Topic</a> number two was really covering the topic of the communication strategy, which we asked the administration for about a year and a half ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=617.046s">That</a> topic, they did share with us a number of updates around a new platform that they have purchased that will streamline communications so in addition to being able to more seamlessly push web content out which I think is <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=632.678s">a</a> huge and important part of how we improve and up our game on a website perspective, but that the tool also has the capability to streamline communications around social media, texting, potentially to replace school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=645.845s">So</a> they are evaluating that piece of it to figure out what the implementation timing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=651.528s">And</a> they did say they hope to give us a preview of some of the work on the website going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=656.37s">There</a> were lots of good questions asked about the platform versus the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=662.513s">And</a> I think one of the things the team felt really good about is that the contract we signed for the software tool does come with support dedicated to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=672.44s">So</a> we will have some administrative support from the vendor that will make less lighter work of that side of the house for us that will allow us to focus on content. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=684.621s">So</a> that was sort of a quick summary of the meeting and I will submit the five policies so we can officially vote on that at the next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=720.886s">When</a> we ask you all to send those five policies back to us, I think that'll give us the runway to schedule a subsequent meeting about that topic.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2069.878s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2071.698s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2072.499s">I</a> agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2073.079s">This</a> is probably going to be the most fun we have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2075.84s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2078.52s">I</a> recall that in last year's budget, we added staff to support the adaptive PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2087.383s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2089.203s">Was</a> it half an FTE or a full FTE? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2092.624s">I'm</a> just trying to remember.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2100.309s">And</a> based on this first year and all the IEPs that you're moving through, and I know you said you anticipate the program to grow, do you <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2110.632s">do</a> you anticipate that you will need the school committee to respond with additional staff at this year, next year, sometime soon, or we think we're in like a level space?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.122s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.382s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.802s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2445.505s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4925.321s">I</a> just wanna make sure I'm clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4927.763s">So</a> the 2% COLA that you referenced that was in the FY22 budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4936.235s">equates</a> to how much money?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4939.178s">And</a> that is across all bargaining units, or is that just the teachers contract?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4981.938s">So</a> 2% equals a million dollars and that is for all units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4986.819s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4987.299s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4988.079s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4988.439s">And</a> that's for FY 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4989.22s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4990.99s">So</a> for FY23, 2% would equal more than $1 million.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5143.816s">And</a> the I guess the other question I had the last two years of the two years since I've been on the committee have been budget anomalies in terms of like what historically has happened here in Medford from a net increase of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5158.181s">So</a> last year we got like a whatever was seven 8% increase something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5165.083s">8.2.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5165.103s">The</a> year before that, we got zero in the early days of the pandemic, which we had to continue to meet all our increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5173.607s">So</a> it was like effectively a net loss of money that we would have come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5179.169s">What</a> is our history in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5181.189s">So</a> what is a typical increase from the municipality
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5187.576s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5268.453s">And</a> so that 4% would also include any additional positions that are added year to year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5293.999s">And</a> how many positions did we add? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5297.093s">from</a> the last fiscal year, roughly? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5298.734s">I</a> feel like there were a good number of positions added in the last year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6047.143s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6048.984s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6049.184s">Douglas,</a> I just had one more question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6051.626s">I</a> think maybe it's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6053.748s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure, Dr. Edouard-Vincent said that you all are planning to meet tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6058.212s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6058.692s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6059.233s">My</a> question, I think it's moot now, was like, are you telling us you're at impasse on these issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6064.217s">And</a> I think the answer <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6065.558s">based</a> on what I just heard is that that conversation is continuing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6146.974s">Maybe</a> this is the most fun we're going to have tonight, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6171.4s">So</a> I know that you know that that's who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6174.18s">So</a> the last thing I want to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6176.943s">I</a> don't think because of the confidentiality we have in place, I don't think any of us are in a position to or at liberty to like respond to any of the specific things you've talked about tonight because they are supposed to be at the bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6189.406s">I</a> would ask that you guys continue to do what you've been doing and show up to the bargaining table and be creative and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6195.768s">I</a> think one of the ways we have navigated this pandemic better than so many communities is we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6201.889s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6202.789s">I</a> do want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6203.93s">I</a> know this is hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6205.45s">I</a> know negotiating is never fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6208.592s">You</a> will never be happy at the end of a negotiation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6211.273s">That's</a> just sort of the nature of a negotiation, sadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6214.354s">You'll</a> never be completely happy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6277.515s">So</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6278.036s">Douglas,</a> just one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6280.799s">She</a> keeps trying to run away. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6282.239s">So</a> I did want to say thank you and happy Teacher Appreciation Week to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6288.361s">You</a> make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6289.481s">It</a> matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6290.301s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6291.562s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6292.322s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6719.966s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6720.527s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6721.948s">Can</a> I, before we take this vote, can I ask Dr. Edward Benson and Mr. Murphy to weigh in on this motion about making the rules of engagement of negotiations public?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8001.99s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2022-04-27_MArbA-sWqH8/2022-04-27_MArbA-sWqH8.html">Communications and Family Engagement Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=42.911s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=45.593s">We</a> can just give everyone another minute or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=57.664s">Actually,</a> while we are waiting for people to join, maybe I will start doing some of the initial reading of our <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=67.743s">meeting</a> notice and then we can get that out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=70.104s">So</a> please be advised that on Wednesday, April 27th from four to 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=78.026s">there'll</a> be a communications and family engagement subcommittee meeting held for remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=83.228s">The</a> meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 from four to 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=90.065s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call in by using the following link or call-in number. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=98.233s">The</a> Zoom phone number is 301-715-8592. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=100.415s">And</a> the meeting ID is 975-668-61252. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=113.527s">Our</a> agenda topics for today are absenteeism and truancy notifications and communications strategy update. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=124.238s">I'm</a> just going to take the roll real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=127.782s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=131.108s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=132.169s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=133.05s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=133.671s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=134.151s">Okay,</a> so three present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=138.335s">Do</a> we need to wait for anybody else to join from the administrative team before we get started?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=188.249s">So,</a> Superintendent, we already read the meeting notice and took attendance, so we are ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=195.763s">So</a> we can go ahead and dive right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=197.084s">I</a> know we only have an hour and we have another subcommittee meeting right after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=201.21s">So</a> my thought is that we'll try to keep each of these topics to about 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=207.238s">And</a> if we need to follow up in a subsequent meeting, we can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=214.06s">Okay,</a> so the first topic is absenteeism and truancy notices and the resolution that was unanimously passed by the school committee is as follows, whereas MPS is required to distribute notifications to caregivers regarding truancy and absenteeism and whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=232.47s">The</a> Medford School Committee and the MPS administration are committed to creating a collaborative partnership between home and school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=238.334s">Be</a> it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communications Subcommittee will meet to review district communications regarding truancy and absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=246.079s">The</a> committee will review our regulatory requirements in current communications to ensure there is compliance with regulations and that our letters achieve our objectives of collaborative partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=257.046s">So,</a> just by way of a little bit of background on this topic in terms of what we hear from community members in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=266.03s">Each</a> year, or at least each year in the past, the district has sent out, there are two things that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=274.396s">So</a> one is at the beginning of the year, there's a note that goes out from our district attorney, Marion Ryan, about truancy and the consequences of truancy, which go into some detail to include involvement from DCF and other agencies <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=296.501s">And</a> then also a requirement that we have to send out notifications once students have missed a certain amount of time under DESE's regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=305.444s">I</a> believe it's, is it five days where the notices go out? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=310.866s">And</a> over the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=313.362s">year</a> or so, we have, I know I and probably other members of the committee have heard from families, and I know that the administration has as well, around both of those notices, I would say for different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=327.07s">So</a> what I was hoping we could talk about today is really getting to like level footing on what we are required to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=336.735s">And</a> I think also understanding the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=341.113s">of</a> what we are trying to accomplish in both of those communications, particularly, Megan, thank you for joining with our Director of Family Engagement on board and to talk about as a district, how do we think about proceeding forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=360.242s">So</a> I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=361.663s">I</a> don't know if my fellow committee members have any questions or comments about this topic that they wanted to share before we dive in.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=432.591s">Yeah,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=434.372s">And</a> I guess, you know, before the meeting, I did a little bit of my own digging on the DESE website to try to sort of understand the lay of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=443.457s">So</a> superintendent, you can definitely correct me on this because I expect that you're more an expert on DESE regulation in this regard than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=453.283s">But</a> my understanding is that that letter, that five day absence letter is a requirement of DESE, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=559.763s">And</a> is the 5, 10, 15 day threshold total absences or unexcused absences?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=668.894s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=670.824s">I</a> think that's really fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=673.286s">So</a> I think as we look forward to next year around these letters, I think one of the unresolved conflicts in the letters and the approach versus like the public health guidance that people are much more committed to following now is if you feel sick, stay home, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=694.825s">And</a> I think that's always been a rule, but people, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=698.541s">listen</a> to it a little bit more seriously now than they ever have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=704.123s">And</a> so I'm just wondering, and as I was sort of asking myself that question in preparation for the meeting, I actually went into our policy manual and we have one, two, three, four, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=717.509s">five</a> policies at the school committee level that address absenteeism and truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=724.695s">And</a> I find them to be rather convoluted, honestly, as I read through all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=732.342s">And</a> I do think we probably should aim to be a little bit more simple than having five policies about what I think is really maybe two topics, absenteeism and truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=746.739s">So</a> I think we have to, we'll sort of circle back around to those policy issues at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=752.92s">But</a> I guess the question is, as we go into next year, how do we reconcile our five, 10, 15 days of unexcused absence with the notion that if you are feeling symptomatic of COVID, which I don't think is gonna go away necessarily, stay home. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=775.536s">most</a> doctors are not engaging in those kinds of conversations to be able to provide a note of absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=781.98s">So</a> I think I would just want us to be able to be clear about like what constitutes a COVID related excused absence so that that can be reflected in our policy at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=795.207s">And</a> then also in terms of how we count those absences as we go on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=995.814s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=995.975s">Fidler-Kerry,</a> did you want to speak?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1215.731s">Thank</a> you, so I think in terms of next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1221.955s">As</a> it relates to this conversation, I think there's maybe two components. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1226.218s">One</a> is to revisit the letters, and it sounds like maybe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1231.321s">Fidler-Carey's</a> team might be best to take a crack at what those letters might say and bring it back to this group for review, Superintendent, if you're in agreement with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1243.329s">And</a> then the other thing that I think we should do is we should bring these five policies to the school committee with a recommendation that this group will continue to work through policy revision on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1255.837s">And</a> so there are five that I was able to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1258.519s">There's</a> JEC, which is the high school class attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1263.732s">There's</a> JED, which is the middle school class attendance and tardiness policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1268.776s">There's</a> JF-R, uniform registration and attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1275.841s">Then</a> there's JHBA, the duties of the supervisor of attendance and JHB, truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1287.022s">So</a> I think if my colleagues are in agreement, we would put a motion on the agenda to ask this committee to conduct the review of those five policies and recommend changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1301.638s">So,</a> Member Kreatz, Member McLaughlin, do you have any questions or comments on that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1310.524s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1312.086s">Okay,</a> Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1313.647s">So</a> can I ask one of you to make a motion to well actually I just had.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1357.722s">Okay,</a> so motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1361.959s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1366.038s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1366.218s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1367.278s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1372.54s">A</a> member grant, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1373.56s">Okay,</a> so three in the affirmative, zero negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1377.141s">We'll</a> add that as part of the readout to ask the committee to make an official vote on that so that we can continue that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1385.162s">And</a> then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1386.183s">Fidler-Carey,</a> I will perhaps connect with you about the timing that you feel like you'll need to do your work before we're able to all come back together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1398.226s">The</a> other piece of this conversation that I wanted to make sure we didn't run out of time for is the letter from Mary and Ryan that goes out at the beginning of the year and each year that it goes out, there definitely is a flurry of question and concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1417.876s">When</a> I looked on the DESE website, I could not see anywhere that required that a letter from the district attorney <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1425.079s">go</a> out regarding absenteeism, but I wanted to confirm that with with you all that that is not a regulatory requirement that we need to comply with.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1519.396s">So</a> I guess what I'm trying to understand is, what are we required to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1524.358s">Because</a> I think it's important that we're compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1527.76s">If</a> I could like intuit the intent of that letter, it's to set the tone at the beginning of the year that we expect students to come to school and work hard, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1542.166s">I</a> think there are a thousand ways to achieve that objective without, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1547.215s">threatening</a> DCF involvement in your family, which is the feedback that I get from parents with this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1556.704s">So</a> I think in the spirit of, and I am completely supportive of being proactive and setting a tone from the district that says these are our policies around attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1568.955s">Every</a> single year so that people know what they are and know what to expect and they know the difference between an excuse and an unexcused absence and that definition probably you know it's likely to change over time, you know, as we have seen, but I think my question is, can we move to something a little bit more family centered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1590.255s">in</a> our pursuit to disseminate our policy than a note from law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1597.681s">I</a> feel like it just sort of jumps way down the line of severity when by and large, what we're trying to do is communicate what our policy is, and the letter itself doesn't actually communicate our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1613.873s">So</a> we're sending this letter <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1618.055s">in</a> a sort of big brothery kind of way, but what the letter doesn't actually do is help people understand what our policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1624.696s">So</a> I think my question is, could we move to something that is more effective and less stressful to some of our families? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1636.639s">And</a> maybe that's something Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1638.539s">Fidler-Curry</a> would be willing to work with us on, but member McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1902.041s">Yeah,</a> completely understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1904.182s">And</a> I think there's likely a way <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1910.226s">To</a> have that letter authored by you that reflects our policies and our practices that you know handle like the majority of our students and the issues we're going to encounter in the course of a school year, and then provide a link to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1927.846s">DA</a> Ryan's letter, which does include a whole bunch of legalese about the law around the requirements to send your kids to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1937.731s">So</a> I think it's important that we provide that information for those who are interested in reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1942.754s">I</a> just think fronting with that information loses the message about partnership collaboration and what our policies are here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1951.598s">So</a> I think there's a way to accomplish all those things as long as we are clear about what the requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1957.942s">But</a> I want the communication to be about what is happening here in Medford and what our commitments are to family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1966.208s">And</a> I feel like the current approach is like not quite getting us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1970.652s">So</a> a revision to that, I think would be welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=1974.855s">Member</a> McLaughlin, did you have your hand in the air?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2023.742s">And</a> I think if we take a holistic approach to this letter and the 5, 10, 15 day letter that we were talking about, there's probably an opportunity to be progressive in how much of that information we are putting in each of those subsequent letters when we have families that we are really concerned about so that those things can be formally documented as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2044.85s">So</a> sort of considering all of that as a package of communication, I think is really important too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2054.917s">Okay,</a> so in terms of next steps, superintendent, you will do a little bit of investigating about the requirement from a regulatory perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2065.724s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2066.044s">Fidler-Carey,</a> I will connect with you about timing in terms of our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2071.107s">And</a> then we will put that resolution to review those policies on the school committee, the next school committee agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2077.391s">And</a> then this group will reconvene at some point in the next few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2082.483s">Any</a> other questions or comments about topic number one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2093.17s">So</a> topic number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2096.332s">The</a> the resolution passed by the school committee is whereas the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2101.917s">met</a> on 12-1-2020 to discuss the district communication strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2106.28s">And</a> whereas during that meeting, the administration discussed goals for a new and comprehensive platform to manage communications and the need for a new website, be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communication Subcommittee will meet to review the progress to date, understand current efforts, discuss future efforts, and identify funding requirements to meet the goal of having a cohesive communication strategy that meets the needs of families and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2130.974s">So</a> I was hoping in this meeting we could hear some updates I think back in 2020, which does feel a little bit like a lifetime ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2142.505s">There</a> was a new, you all were considering a new platform which would have been implemented in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2149.971s">of</a> 21 that would have consolidated communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2152.712s">And</a> I just wanted us to start with getting a better understanding of where you all are in that process, whether it's been delayed or where we're at, so that we can think about the upcoming needs.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2451.395s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2452.375s">That</a> was actually going to be one of my first questions, which was like, what is the scope of what final site is providing to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2459.957s">So</a> it sounds like we are planning to use their website platform for sure, and we're still considering the communications pieces, or have we already made that decision?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2514.203s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2516.865s">The</a> other questions that I had around some of the work that you all are doing <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2524.422s">in</a> regard to the budget is I think it's wonderful that students have an opportunity to participate in this process, especially those in the related vocational teams, but students move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2538.807s">And</a> I do feel like we need to have a sustainable way to keep the integrity of our information where we want it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2547.57s">And</a> I think in all fairness that putting that responsibility on students and <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2553.949s">in</a> classrooms from year to year to year is not a way necessarily to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2559.373s">So</a> I think one question I had is what sort of central supports are you all planning on so that we don't solely rely on students who have their own learning curriculum that they need to be worried about?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2675.453s">teachers</a> or administrators? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2677.273s">Like</a> what is your vision for how folks in each of the schools will be like rolling into this effort?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2881.897s">Great,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2883.777s">Member</a> McLaughlin, Member Kreatz, do you have any questions so far?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2899.875s">Dr.</a> Edward-Vincent, the other question I had is, you know, I think websites have two, like, important components. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2907.758s">One</a> is, like, the structure and the look and the feel, and the other is, like, the quality of the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2914.36s">And</a> I was curious if you could talk to us a little bit about how you have engaged families as you have called through content or what your plans are to engage families for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2929.266s">I</a> feel like I have heard from folks over time, particularly folks that don't go to Medford public schools and are trying to learn about us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=2939.33s">I</a> can't make heads or tails of the content on the website, so I'm just curious like what efforts there have been to actually engage families both inside and outside of the district.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3108.404s">Yeah,</a> I think that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3109.564s">I</a> think it will be helpful for us to like publicize that opportunity in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3119.606s">And</a> I think we would be probably like, I'm thinking likely to get folks within the district interested in like participating in that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3127.988s">What</a> I am curious about though, is like whether we would be successful in getting <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3134.751s">people</a> who are not in the district to engage in this kind of a meeting and how we reach out to, and I don't have any particular suggestions, but how we reach out and find families. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3147.636s">And</a> I'm thinking specifically of the new families who are trying to think about, do I go to Medford Public Schools or do I try to get into a charter school? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3155.819s">The</a> charter school websites do a big job of making people feel compelled <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3163.998s">to</a> engage in their charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3166.28s">And</a> I think, by contrast, like our websites never sort of gone after that same aim. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3172.445s">And</a> so I think folks, you know, there may be some folks in the community who might be <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3179.411s">willing</a> to chat with us informally or outside of a meeting, but I would be really interested in their feedback too, because I think there is a population of people who never like walk through the door that are also looking at our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3193.763s">And</a> I wanna make sure we're thinking about their input and feedback too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3197.606s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3293.67s">Thank</a> you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3295.111s">I</a> think your chat comment also brings up a question about what our strategic plans are for the website in terms of language translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3304.855s">And</a> I didn't know, Superintendent, what the vision is there or what the roadmap is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3554.144s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3556.145s">The</a> other thing that I just wanted to mention, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3560.141s">because</a> it actually came up I was in another meeting last evening with some community members and when we talked originally about this topic we talked about sort of a stretch goal if you will that there would be some availability for our PTOs to engage on the messaging side of things in some way shape or form and I think at the time <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3582.538s">What</a> we talked about is, you know, PTOs having access to be able to send emails and things like that in some fashion that would take advantage of folks who have opted into that kind of a communication, but require sort of one-stop shopping for families to submit their information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3603.143s">And</a> then an actual platform for PTOs, there are some PTOs who, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3610.001s">have</a> and manage their own platforms, which is really time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3616.546s">But,</a> and then there are others, and I was talking to members of the community last night in communities where they don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3623.212s">And</a> so it's very, very difficult for them to engage their communities and create community amongst folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3630.998s">So</a> it's, you know, they sort of talk about the same usual set of suspects and it's just sort of a, <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3635.418s">bigger</a> part of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3636.459s">So</a> I just want to put that like bug out into the world so that as you talk with some final site, perhaps they have some options there as well that we could consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3645.251s">And</a> it is five o'clock and I don't want us to go over because I know Member McLaughlin and I both have another meeting to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3651.839s">So</a> is there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3676.135s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3679.557s">Roll</a> call, so Member Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3682.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3683.218s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3684.439s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3685.239s">And</a> Member Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3686.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3686.52s">Thanks,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3687.7s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3689.121s">Meeting</a> is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3689.981s">Have</a> a good night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MArbA-sWqH8&t=3690.441s">All</a> right, bye, have a good night.<h2><a href="../2022-04-27_xAhZWxUOGq4/2022-04-27_xAhZWxUOGq4.html">Rules and Policy Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=559.608s">I</a> think you just need to take retainer out of the sentence for budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=564.093s">No,</a> leave that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=567.457s">Take</a> on the other side of budgeted.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1665.866s">I</a> did want to say that I <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1677.544s">the</a> universal dress code specifically around things that are not permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1681.226s">I</a> think this does a really nice job of getting at the spirit and the intent of the work that we're trying to do around the dress code and does, I think, put some really appropriate boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1697.655s">Because</a> I think we heard, I'll say fears from folks in the last meeting around the notion that <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1707.951s">things</a> students wear to school could make others uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1711.194s">So</a> I think discomfort is a hard thing to sort of get to an objective place, but I do like sort of the framing that you've used to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1725.627s">what</a> do we consider to be objectionable in some way, shape or form? <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1732.152s">So</a> I did really appreciate the framing of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1737.056s">And</a> I agreed with all that you wrote. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1741.959s">I</a> think on the enforcement side, the one question I had around students not being sent out of class, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1753.575s">I</a> think the question is, if we're saying that students can't be sent out of class, how can non-compliant students be expected to become compliant inside of the school day? <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1767.006s">So</a> I was just curious about that component of it and how that might play out in a school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=1775.794s">And</a> I'd love to hear from the administration about that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=2346.548s">The</a> sort of spirit of the preceding sentence, the staff will use reasonable efforts to avoid dress coding students in front of other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=2357.573s">Maybe</a> there's some similar language that can be used in this next paragraph around staff using reasonable efforts to avoid removing students from class. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=2373.678s">unless</a> the attire creates a substantial disruption, just so that there is some flexibility there, because there are reasons that we could certainly brainstorm that would lend it to not being a true disruption, but also being important to address at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAhZWxUOGq4&t=2397.368s">So</a> maybe just something like that would cover it.<h2><a href="../2022-04-11_63m6ohF-DtU/2022-04-11_63m6ohF-DtU.html">4.11.2022 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=118.434s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=160.665s">I</a> did have a question, just that my name was left off of the attendance.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=1544.701s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2579.714s">Member</a> Graham, on the topic of transportation, when we have the budget hearing, will you be talking to us about <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2587.639s">the</a> efforts that we piloted this year to make getting to the high school fee free for students who are outside of two miles and the review that you all were doing to bring that outer threshold in from two miles to something less than two miles.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2680.647s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2685.84s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2868.419s">I</a> was just going to say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2871.24s">I</a> think there is discussion on Beacon Hill about this because the federal legislation has effectively died on the vine. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2879.781s">So</a> I think there is discussion and for folks who are passionate about this, letting your state reps know that this is important to you would be a wonderful reinforcement of priorities here in Medford, for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2897.366s">And</a> then I did have another question and I'm forgetting it now, so I will see if the board members.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2976.843s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2977.903s">Sorry,</a> I remembered my question now. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2980.084s">Before</a> your time, I believe, the sequence of events is foggy because of the pandemic, but before your time, we did pass a resolution asking the administration to review with us on an annual basis the status of all of our revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=2997.945s">And</a> I know that's not part of the mainline budget, but when we talk about food service and another hot topic in the community right now, the afterschool program, those all happen in the revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=3008.716s">I</a> think generally the public doesn't have a huge appreciation for what happens in those revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=3014.021s">And</a> it's literally everything from like lost library book funds to food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=3019.026s">So</a> can we, <a href="https://youtu.be/63m6ohF-DtU&t=3021.636s">find</a> some time before the end of June to do that review of the revolving accounts and community schools is the other really big one that happens.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1463.153s">I</a> have a couple of questions for you from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1468.838s">You</a> mentioned that there were parents involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1472.5s">Could</a> you talk a little bit about how they were involved in the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1476.183s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1616.022s">And</a> can you talk to us a little bit about what the rubric contained, like what were the factors they were looking for in the rubric and <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1623.638s">yes</a> that this prevailed it was it like overwhelming majority was in agreement this way and the reason i ask is because when we started this conversation we talked about ed reports as being sort of a jumping off point and the investigations curriculum does not fare as well in ed reports as bridges does so i'm just curious which what there's no like red stop signs anywhere but i'm just curious <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1649.332s">what</a> the, like how we sort of progress through the logic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1652.738s">I</a> think for people who are really interested in improving the math instruction, that would be helpful to know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1877.304s">Number</a> three, we have overview of summer programming opportunities at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1882.593s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=1882.794s">Suzanne</a> Galussi, assistant superintendent of elementary, and Dr. Peter Cushing, the assistant superintendent of secondary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3319.149s">If</a> I may, I just have one question about the academic skills camp at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3327.933s">When</a> we talk about academic skills, are you talking about things like executive function skills?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3381.257s">And</a> is that program an invitational program or is that like an open to anyone in the district?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3452.766s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I know we have Dr. Cushing spoken about this at the middle school level a couple of times offline and there's a lot of parents out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3461.707s">especially</a> at the middle school level, where as a parent, you just have no visibility to what is happening in the school at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3467.209s">There's</a> no conferences, like you really have to work to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3471.27s">And</a> if your kid is struggling with like the basics of like organization, it's even harder to help them at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3478.632s">So</a> thinking about not just during summer, but in general, how do we do a better job of helping kids get good baseline functional <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3490.536s">executive</a> functioning skills in middle school to sort of position them to be ready for high school, I think would be a huge asset both in summer and in some sort of afterschool something or other and in the curriculum in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3504.086s">But</a> I definitely think there's an opportunity to like weave that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3507.028s">And</a> I think there's a lot of parents out there who, if that was part of the process would be quite interested in figuring out how they can get their kid to engage for that 90 minutes a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3522.503s">Are</a> there any other questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3564.799s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pNsbtNhohgk&t=3567.082s">Item</a> number four report on the superintendent's listening tour in the Medford public schools, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1442.442s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1445.564s">I</a> think to try to answer the two questions I think you posed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1449.406s">One</a> is, there's nothing that jumps out at me immediately, personally, that we would have to add to that list of four, but I agree we could <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1457.705s">find</a> something along the way that we would want to dedicate time for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1462.167s">And</a> then in terms of like four sessions versus two sessions, I am in favor of two sessions over like the extended short four session approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1475.112s">April</a> is the April calendar is already starting to escalate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1479.814s">So</a> I and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1482.519s">I</a> definitely, I hadn't seen those states before, so I just need to look at them and I will let the superintendent know if there's any.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1497.303s">But</a> I do think trying to organize around two nights makes sense for the people who are interested in following the budget from end to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1505.066s">Like</a> I think coming up with like four nights across one month <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=1510.569s">with</a> school vacation right in the middle of it would be hard.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2825.802s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2826.943s">When</a> we talked earlier this year about some of the challenges that we were seeing at the high school, I asked you whether students knew how to access services, and you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2840.95s">it</a> sort of seems like they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2843.171s">So</a> what has changed about that, if anything?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2868.623s">And</a> after that presentation, I actually got some feedback from members of the community about whether group support is really the right kind of support for our teenagers, given that they're teenagers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2889.48s">It's</a> not the first thing that middle schoolers and high schoolers really want to do is sort of expose <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2896.563s">what's</a> challenging them in a group setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2898.323s">So</a> what, like when we think about how we're supporting students, do we have mechanisms in place beyond inviting them to come to groups that may make them feel uncomfortable enough not to engage?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2925.766s">And</a> I think the other question that we had as we were thinking about wanting this information is, is there enough to meet the need? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2935.411s">And</a> all I continue to hear from anybody who works in a school right now is that this is worse than any other year of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2945.918s">This</a> is very hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2947.859s">It's</a> exhausting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2949.32s">Students</a> are really struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2951.581s">So</a> do we have enough to meet the need? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=2954.957s">is</a> my question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3127.885s">Thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3128.926s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3130.466s">Just</a> as you think about the budget and the requests that you're going to make, it's sort of surprising, although maybe it's not in the counseling world, that we have a huge slew of part-timers on our roster. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3145.892s">And</a> if it works, it's fine, but I do question whether <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3152.338s">we're</a> like meeting the needs of the staff or we're meeting the needs of the students by having all these part timers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3156.962s">And</a> I want the budget to reflect what we need to meet the needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3161.965s">And</a> if we can make that also work for staff, that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3165.128s">But</a> we are looking at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3167.169s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3167.47s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3317.075s">Three</a> questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3317.675s">Are</a> there fees at the middle school level?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3331.905s">They're</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3334.487s">And</a> then I think the other thing that sort of stands out to me is like, this is all athletics, but we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3341.718s">other</a> extracurricular activities at the high school level where there are substantial costs associated with the programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3348.199s">I'm</a> thinking of like the band, the marching band and orchestra, all of those programs where the band parents in particular raise oodles of money or they're kind of constantly out there doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3363.422s">So</a> have we considered <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3367.582s">looking</a> at moving to a universal user fee and what would that look like?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3436.453s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3438.254s">And</a> my understanding is we're the only school in the GBL that charges user fees at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3442.357s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3462.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3463.06s">And</a> then my last question is about the distinction between the students who have complete fee waiver <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3472.892s">versus</a> the folks who are in this separate financial hardship bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3479.875s">I</a> think I've sort of philosophical question about like why those two things are separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3487.779s">But</a> then also, is there a process with sufficient oversight to ensure that we are giving out hardship waivers in a consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3498.417s">manner.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3564.471s">Yeah,</a> and I think as we think about this financial hardship category, like this also came up as we talked about the before and after school program in terms of establishing like a mechanism internally to deal with folks who have like interim <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3583.375s">that</a> we can help address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3586.037s">I</a> would just want to make sure that there's some consistency about like how this is evaluated across all the various places where we're issuing hardship waivers across the district so that we don't find ourselves in a situation where the athletic staff is <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3602.012s">applying</a> some amount of judgment that's completely like a different set of variables than would be applied elsewhere.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3621.367s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3622.048s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4761.327s">Susie,</a> the folks on Zoom can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4764.59s">Can</a> you talk into the microphone? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4768.993s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4773.036s">Or</a> you can right at the desk there if you want.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4843.819s">Would</a> it be possible to simply put a link to the document on the website so that way the document can continue to be the one place you maintain and the people who want to see can go to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4859.49s">It's</a> the same way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=4861.191s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5706.951s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5936.915s">So</a> as I was looking at this, it felt like sort of two things were trying to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5944.141s">One</a> is we were trying to be responsive to the questions that I think we're all hearing from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5948.505s">Like</a> I got a question last week about the <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5951.785s">The</a> feature on the website that allows you to look at like how scores are tracking towards various colleges and whether that implies or means or doesn't mean that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5962.895s">score</a> these scores would be reported to colleges, I think there's a lot of questions in the parent community about what's going on, and then there were a couple of questions specifically for for five. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5974.981s">maybe</a> just four and five or maybe five a um that were really more about the implementation that would pertain to us and I just wondered if it would be even better to have to ask the administration to do like a recorded zoom of some kind for the community so that there's something lasting that can be posted that can live past the immediate questions that we have this year that can help <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6004.632s">parents</a> come in next year, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6007.833s">versus</a> like having them come and present at a meeting that is attended roughly like this one, where there aren't that many folks involved and people may or may not want to weed through a whole meeting to try to get to the to the piece that they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6021.817s">But</a> then also, questions four and five <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6026.212s">In</a> particular, were to me more about the implementation and things that this committee would be like more uniquely interested in talking about in terms of like, how is this going, how is it aligning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6037.249s">And</a> I think the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6041.628s">it</a> seems missing a really important element, which is we should be receiving aggregated information at the school committee every time this test is handed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6051.952s">And</a> we haven't received any data about what's happening at a district wide level, essentially, to know are our students where we expect them to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6061.897s">Is</a> there growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6063.297s">Is</a> it sufficient growth, et cetera, which I think are the questions that this group is particularly interested in answering. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6068.239s">So</a> I guess I would just, <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6070.757s">have</a> a couple of questions for the folks who put this forward about whether those possibilities are interesting, agreeable, and what thoughts you all have on those things as you put this together.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6179.369s">I</a> guess I was just suggesting that the vast majority of these questions are really questions that I've heard from members of the community that parents would have an interest in in a continuing way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6194.059s">And</a> rather than asking the administration to prepare a report to us, which is fine, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6203.408s">Maybe</a> it could be more useful if it was instead an information session available and geared towards parents, because I think it's going to have a slightly different level of information if that audience is catered to appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6216.432s">And</a> it seems like we could get what we need from that, and parents could be better served in that way, versus having a report here amongst a really thin audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6232.76s">know,</a> then that getting lost in the shuffle of school committee meeting recordings, where something about MAP could be on the website, parents could look at it from year to year, it could evolve over time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6258.822s">I</a> think there are still questions that are school committee worthy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6262.184s">I'm</a> just suggesting that there are two different masters we're trying to you know, achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6269.907s">We're</a> trying to get to two completely different audiences and trying to use one presentation to do that may or may not be as effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6279.852s">So,</a> I think we certainly would, I would certainly be interested in a presentation that <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6287.227s">talks</a> about like, how is this matching teacher perception and number four? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6290.71s">And</a> like, are they, are the map results being analyzed and used for purposes other than to inform classroom instruction? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6297.234s">And</a> if so, what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6299.256s">And</a> then, you know, again, the school committee reporting, I'm fine with taking data, knowing that it's the first year and that it's a pandemic and it's all those things, but I still want to see the data of how our schools are performing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6314.55s">which</a> I think is perfectly appropriate for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6316.772s">It</a> just feels like there's two different things happening in here, and maybe there are two different ways to deliver that information so that they get to the audiences that they need.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6336.524s">I</a> was just looking for some feedback, that's all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6362.685s">I</a> feel like one, two, three, five, B, six, seven, and eight are all questions that in my mind would be of interest to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=6373.134s">where</a> that information could be delivered to families versus the stuff about truly the implementation that's time limited, it's time sensitive, really does belong here.<h2><a href="../2022-03-09_0fOl57ml-A4/2022-03-09_0fOl57ml-A4.html">COW Meeting to Review and Revise SC Rules Document</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=717.343s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=717.623s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=723.508s">So</a> I think we've been elected to do a job, and I don't think the public particularly elected us to do an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=730.313s">And</a> I think there's a general expectation that we'll come and do the job, whatever it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=736.098s">And</a> having said that, I'm also not a proponent of meeting very, very late into the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=742.122s">It's</a> the reason why I voted against not starting a meeting until 6.30 p.m., because as I've been tracking, literally, since we took that vote, we never get to new business before seven o'clock, really before 7.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=757.928s">So</a> we have a solid hour of things we have to accomplish easily, sometimes more, that happen before the kinds of items that the public would be wanting to weigh in on <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=772.572s">And</a> it's the reason why I think 6.30 is late to start, given that we're all concerned about the administration and the demands we're placing on them in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=783.614s">They</a> are full-time employees, they're not elected officials, but they're sort of stuck with us for the duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=791.595s">So</a> I would be a proponent of starting the meeting at six and saying that the end time of the meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=802.008s">would</a> be 1030. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=803.248s">I</a> feel like that gives us a bigger, better window to actually accomplish our business without having to go to weekly meetings, bringing in the outside a little bit from 11 o'clock, and really not compromising the public's ability to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=818.532s">And</a> I would welcome my fellow committee members' thoughts on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1363.72s">I</a> am sensitive to the fact that balancing all of these competing priorities is really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1371.463s">I</a> just go back to thinking about the job we have been elected to do, and sometimes that job is going to be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1379.046s">I</a> think it has to, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1380.449s">You</a> know, there have to be some guardrails that help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1384.18s">be</a> efficient and brief and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1387.863s">So</a> I do think starting at six, I don't think that erodes the public's ability to participate because like I said, we don't get to those agenda items until much, much later in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1398.31s">Our</a> meetings are recorded and can be watched at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1401.452s">So</a> I feel like that does mitigate some of that six o'clock start time concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1405.455s">I</a> think if we could all agree on like a six to 10 <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1411.266s">time</a> frame, I think that would actually be a nice compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1415.208s">And,</a> you know, continuing to work to not be meeting at 10pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1420.731s">But,</a> you know, Kathy, my suggestion would be six to 10, so that we're not fighting by a vote of two thirds about whether to continue a meeting, which could quickly become about avoiding agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1435.963s">and</a> disappointing the public who showed up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1437.945s">So</a> I would like to see us think about the consequences of this in real time, playing out, needing two thirds of a vote to continue at times when we have a room full of people who came to speak is not going to be pleasant. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1458.52s">So</a> I would rather our outside times <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1461.463s">be</a> perceived as reasonable by everybody and never be construed that this committee is trying not to work hard on behalf of the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1471.152s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1661.511s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1735.256s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1738.879s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1784.903s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1790.426s">I</a> believe that at the last meeting we put number 67 on the table and I would like to make a motion to take it off the table so we can discuss.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1834.109s">Mayor,</a> I would make a motion to approve that as written.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2137.902s">Yeah,</a> just to clarify, you want a hyperlink to the General Roberts Rules of Order website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2145.165s">Is</a> that what you're asking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2147.086s">Because</a> this specific detail is not available on the website because they want you to buy the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2154.449s">I</a> think that was member Rousseau's point.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2945.887s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2948.416s">My</a> understanding of this motion is not that the council would have to do this if they had a harmless question, but when they take the time to talk about something on the floor and take a vote on something that pertains to schools, or like, we're gonna ask the school committee something, or we're gonna ask the superintendent something, when they've taken the time in their meeting to weigh in in a majority way, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2978.366s">On</a> something I do believe that should come through the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2982.312s">I</a> don't think we have a process today, which is why it doesn't and i'm glad that it really hasn't become an issue, but I just want to point out where we're headed towards some very. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2996.2s">interesting</a> discussions as we talk about the high school complex, as we talk about ARPA funds, as we talk about funding for our schools, as we talk about all the things that we know are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3012.367s">And</a> I am a proponent of having process that is not onerous, but establishes good habits in times when it's easy to have good habits. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3024.817s">If</a> this comes to blows about the high school, that is not going to be the time for us to be establishing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3033.923s">So</a> I am a proponent of having a way for this to happen in a consistent and rational manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3041.688s">And</a> the last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of pushback from the administration, rightfully so, when we ask for things because there is not enough capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3052.275s">to</a> do whatever the thing is that we might be asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3056.018s">And</a> I think it's reasonable to think that some of these things from the council could over time take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3062.843s">And</a> if they're gonna take time, this body needs to decide whether the thing the council voted on on Tuesday night is more or less important than the thing that is in front of us the following Monday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3074.793s">So</a> from a prioritization perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3079.289s">I</a> think it's really important for us to have process around this and a structure that allows us as a body to consider all the things we have to consider, which in fairness, the council couldn't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3090.772s">Like</a> the council has no idea and shouldn't be expected to know about all the things that we contend with in terms of all the very real resource contention we have in our own district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3103.675s">So</a> expecting them to be able to weigh that when they make <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3107.45s">you</a> know, when they take the time to have a vote, I think is unreasonable and putting this in place would allow us to have a good open line of communication and to do so not at the expense of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3119.903s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3677.209s">I</a> just want to sort of reframe the reason we're talking about having rules, and it has nothing to do with a response particularly to something happening or it's no implication of anything in this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3691.185s">it's</a> instead our collective desire to say we want to have rules so that we can operate effectively and avoid issues in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3699.47s">So</a> I just don't want the narrative of this discussion to be somebody thinks we have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3705.673s">Like</a> sometimes that's how a rule gets created, but the whole point of this document being somewhat disconnected from any particular controversy or controversial issue <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3716.259s">is</a> so that when those controversial issues come up, we can operate against something consistent that we've all agreed on when we're not in the middle of a controversy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3725.727s">Having</a> said that, Cathy, I have no idea what your proposal is in terms of the amendment, so I'm not clear what you're asking us to vote on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4065.102s">I'd</a> be happy to take a roll call on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4171.095s">So</a> as it relates to the beginning part of this, I think what might make sense is to amend the language to say that the council, generically, will pass, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4188.362s">information</a> about requests passed by the council to the mayor and the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4195.905s">If</a> the request can be answered with information that is publicly available, the superintendent will do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4206.01s">If</a> the request requires additional effort on behalf of the district or administration, it'll be placed on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4216.087s">If</a> it's a matter of public record, to me, that is not what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4219.892s">If</a> there's a report that exists that's already in the public domain, then we're not talking about that coming to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4229.466s">ahead</a> of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4230.226s">I</a> think what we're saying is if you're going to expend energy, effort, time, money, creating something to respond to an inquiry, those are the things that we want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4238.708s">At</a> least that is how I am interpreting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4240.849s">It's</a> not to say we're going to gatekeep publicly available information. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4245.61s">That</a> would just be a giant waste of time that nobody has.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4262.071s">I</a> think if it's publicly available information, I think that's the answer, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4303.569s">Can</a> you say it again?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4394.653s">And</a> member Kreatz, perhaps we could say if it can be answered with publicly available information and that just sort of provides that end cap to the conversation we were just having.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4661.548s">Okay,</a> I'm gonna re-add this piece.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4706.947s">As</a> amended by me, Member Kreatz?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4710.728s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5961.702s">Make</a> a motion that we add a sentence that says the superintendent will ensure that there is an appointed custodian of records at all times.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3671.625s">So</a> my only question was whether you need a vote of approval from us to expend the ESSER funds.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4635.293s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4635.993s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Cushman. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4636.934s">Yep,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4637.954s">Do</a> either of these grants need our approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4641.135s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4641.315s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4641.435s">I</a> just wanted to make sure.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4666.806s">And</a> then just one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4668.107s">When</a> will middle school families get their map assessment scores?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6811.146s">I</a> would be in favor of shutting down the vouchers if you can tell us that you're confident that you can put a more equitable system in place before the start of the next school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6972.079s">And</a> the idea behind the surround care paraprofessional that you're seeking our approval to bargain about, I assume, is that we're creating a pool of workers who, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6987.165s">can</a> provide support during part of the school day, but then explicitly for aftercare, and they would be part of the paraprofessionals union, which is not something our afterschool staff are part of today, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7005.277s">Okay,</a> but like the folks who work after school, just after school, they are not part of the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7012.242s">So</a> we would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7014.175s">You</a> know, creating it in addition to I'm assuming that part of the process here is to bargain around things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7022.464s">health</a> benefits, sick leave, all the things that are part of the paras contract would be- Not for all the afterschool staff though. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7030.126s">But</a> for these folks, these surround care paras.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7123.645s">Your</a> report doesn't talk about all the people on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7128.148s">So</a> what I think, as you mentioned, the work that we did last year with the intention to create a more appealing rate of pay in an effort to expand seats did not exactly pan out because of what is happening, not just in Medford Public Schools, but literally everywhere in terms of the worker shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7154.683s">So</a> that didn't pan out in terms of expansion of seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7157.745s">And</a> there's probably, I imagine if anyone looked at the agenda on the first day back from vacation, there's probably a lot of people really interested to know, are we expanding seats? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7168.73s">Can</a> we do it for real this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7170.47s">Because</a> they are still without the options that would be a better fit for their financial situation, their schedule, their families, and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7181.399s">So</a> how do we crack that nut? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7185.382s">And</a> do we think this is going to actually create space in the programs where there is a wait list?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7230.354s">And</a> how will that impact the infamous upcoming lottery, which people are waiting with bated breath on? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7240.313s">in</a> terms of like, that's gonna happen before we know that we have staff to expand the program, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7318.364s">I</a> think I've mentioned to you in the past is this notion that like once you're on the list like that's your spot forever like there's like if you're, you know, low down on the list like basically hang it up for the next six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7333.736s">Is</a> there, can you do some thinking around how to create a better system for the families who are on the wait list, who?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7393.222s">Yeah,</a> I think I'm sensitive to the fact that there's lots of folks who move into the district and they're like, forget about it they don't have a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7402.605s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7403.346s">And</a> then there's also people whose circumstances change from, you know, over the course of six years and again like they just <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7410.873s">it's</a> like not even an option for them to even win the lottery, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7416.674s">And</a> I think, you know, as I've talked to people, what I've tried to impress upon people is that the answer to all this like lottery mumbo jumbo is actually to have enough seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7427.757s">But</a> I just don't expect us to be able to get there in one year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7555.169s">For</a> as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7558.372s">For</a> as long as <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7560.253s">because</a> space is not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7561.673s">Like</a> we would solve the space problem if we were not held back by staffing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7571.055s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8849.752s">So</a> I actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8852.716s">talk</a> to some students and I want to make sure that there are bathrooms in the building that are available, because what I hear from students is that those are the quote nice bathrooms and they are never open when students want to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8867.505s">So,</a> and that could just be a timing issue of when these students happen to have science, but all students have science. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8873.89s">So</a> I think we need to make sure there are bathrooms available for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8877.733s">I</a> talked to students who I know to be very conscientious and they say, you know, I don't go to the bathroom in certain classes because I know that the bathrooms near my classroom are really closed almost all the time, but it's not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8890.543s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8893.993s">I</a> think we just really need to think about how we like crack this nut and the and the thing that I think makes me the most irritated about this is that at the beginning of my term we had this discussion, the principal of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8908.187s">stood</a> at the podium, he told us that he would make sure that every student has a schedule, and there was not one single student that I talked to who said they knew what the schedule was.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8922.278s">Of</a> where to find a bathroom, yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8943.149s">Yeah,</a> I would like to stop talking about whether the bathrooms are open or not because I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8948.698s">conversation</a> we should be having is whether the bathrooms are suitable or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8952.983s">And</a> I look forward to that discussion as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8992.404s">Yeah,</a> the, the students that I talked to definitely said the problem is worse at lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8997.346s">So</a> hopefully that change will will help. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=9002.408s">And</a> then I, there was a student who also told me that <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=9007.044s">she</a> was headed to a bathroom that was open and she was kicked out because the bathroom was going to be closed and she was sent off in search of another bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=9013.729s">So</a> I just, if there's students actively trying to use the bathroom, I would just ask that we hold off on closing the bathroom for five minutes it takes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=9024.598s">It</a> seems really reasonable.<h2><a href="../2022-02-07_95e_A3W3mNI/2022-02-07_95e_A3W3mNI.html">2.7.2022 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=295.242s">While</a> we haven't finished going through the rules, I do think there are some meaningful things happening in the rules document that will make it easier and more transparent to track the things that we are passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=309.389s">So</a> the new numbering system, some of the changes to the way the agenda is being presented, some of the many reasons why I'm in favor of having rules that are documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=324.116s">And</a> I do think, you know, those things are important and would ask the superintendent that if the dates don't work, that you just kindly let us know and that we can figure out a better path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=339.672s">But</a> I am also in support of making sure that there is compliance with the motions passed on the floor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=602.088s">I</a> think one of the things about the numbering system that I really am looking forward to is, in fact, that anything that is undisposed of remains on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=614.995s">I</a> don't actually care how long it gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=617.377s">I</a> think it's very easy to keep track of what is undisposed of at City Council because they sit on the agenda until they are disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=627.522s">So</a> I am in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=629.383s">It</a> brings a level of transparency to the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=631.983s">It</a> makes it top of mind, and it doesn't rely on individual members remembering what it is that they're supposed to be tracking themselves for seeing things all the way to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=646.067s">Things</a> move really fast, and I would be a proponent of all of that stuff remaining on the agenda until it's disposed of.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2436.057s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2439.458s">On</a> the report that you provided, can you tell us what the difference between a detention and a one-hour detention and a two-hour detention and a three-hour detention is? <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2450.163s">I</a> was with you until the last one, two, three, and then just detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2456.126s">What</a> does that mean?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2526.183s">And</a> what is a level one suspension versus an out of school suspension versus an in-school suspension?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2612.335s">And</a> I think the other thing that I'm interested in is understanding like if we are in the midst of a pilot at the Andrews, why are there more suspensions happening there than in any of the other schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2628.64s">So</a> it doesn't, something isn't working.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2679.328s">Okay,</a> and then, do I recall correctly that this also is a subject for a future rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting, because I think you know it was my expectation that before this pot the change the policy went into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2696.719s">that</a> you all were going to come back to us with a set of recommendations and just clarification so that we all knew what to expect and that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2706.549s">So</a> I think we still need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2707.971s">And</a> I just want to make sure that is in fact on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2711.595s">Member</a> Ruseau, is that part of the queue of rules, policy and equity meetings?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2747.868s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2748.648s">So</a> just for the sake of clarity, I'd like to make a motion that the rules, policy and equity subcommittee conduct a follow up meeting to have that discussion around what the restorative justice piloting looks like, what kind of outcomes we can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2766.775s">any</a> clarifications that need to be made to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2770.258s">And</a> I think as importantly, what resources we need to authorize in the upcoming budget that will allow you all to execute the policy that we passed for implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2785.17s">Second,</a> we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2786.531s">We</a> can't do that alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2787.752s">So</a> we need you all to tell us what you need.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2843.033s">Yeah</a> and I would totally anticipate that to be the case and if there are changes that we need to think about from a policy perspective to allow for that ramp then we should do that so we can talk about that at the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=2860.166s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3055.621s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3055.981s">Mayor,</a> member Graham, can I just ask a quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3060.405s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3061.646s">The</a> $15,000 for contracted services for survey tools, that is not meant to supplant the resolution about the climate and culture survey, is it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3074.516s">Perfect,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3417.881s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3418.822s">I</a> wondered if we might make a friendly amendment asking that we inquire what family's preferences are, because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3429.692s">all</a> families are the same in terms of what their level of interest is and I would hate to sort of meet the need that some members of our community are really asking for quite consistently and then sort of make it worse for other families who are just sort of happy with the way things are for their own reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3449.266s">So</a> I know we don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3452.008s">tons</a> of out of district students, and it seems reasonable to amend this, to just ask what their preferences are on an annual basis so that we can honor those. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3463.114s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3642.018s">We</a> have a paid policy service through MASC where all of our policies live. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3649.586s">I</a> don't know if the superintendent knows, there is a link on our website, is there not? <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3656.535s">Okay,</a> so are you, I'm just seeking some clarification, are you asking to duplicate the information that is in the link or are we just wanting to make sure the link is easy to find?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3775.986s">Member</a> Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3918.202s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3918.923s">So</a> what I was saying earlier is that I was wondering if it made sense to take this up a little bit more specifically in our rules, in our rules meeting, because this does seem like a rule more than it is a policy, despite it being in our policy book right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3937.908s">I</a> also think Mass General Law has something very specific to say about orientation and does place the requirement of orientation for school committee members on the MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3948.736s">So</a> I wanna make sure that nothing that we write says that that doesn't exist because I think Mass General Law is clear on where that sits. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3957.183s">I</a> also think there's other components that would be really valuable that I certainly didn't receive any like formal training on around parliamentary procedure and they're really interesting and expensive online options that we might want to pursue and offer to new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=3975.527s">So</a> I just think there's a lot of good stuff here that belongs in our rules book and perhaps we should move this to that meeting so that we can go through those details and make sure that we're consistent with the law, MASC, et cetera.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=4068.993s">I</a> guess my take is we should not sunset this policy, which we can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=4075.693s">really</a> make a change to tonight wholesale anyway, because of our policies prevent that, but, um, we shouldn't do it until we have a rule in place that sort of governs that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=4085.061s">And</a> then we would take the policy through a process of, um, being what's the word repealed. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=4093.147s">So,</a> but I, I don't think it's worth repealing it when the rules haven't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/95e_A3W3mNI&t=4098.872s">And</a> I think all of that needs to be stepped out once we get through the rules document.<h2><a href="../2022-02-03_Csi-YZOcLIg/2022-02-03_Csi-YZOcLIg.html">COW To Review SC Rules Document</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=595.656s">Member</a> Graham and then member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=601.391s">Thank</a> you, so I think anytime you make a change like this you first have to agree on like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=608.659s">What</a> the new thing will be, and then you have to go back and true up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=614.606s">You</a> know where else you might have documentation so from my perspective rules are things that govern this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=621.894s">Policies</a> are things that the superintendent must carry out as she runs the district so to me this document is about how we will operate as a school committee of which the superintendent is not a member of the school committee policies are policies that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=640.39s">the</a> superintendent is expected to carry out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=641.951s">So</a> frankly, we've never had a rules document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=645.052s">So</a> we threw rules in our policies, which was the incorrect step in my opinion, way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=650.314s">So</a> I think the first thing we need to do is talk about these rules as they are presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=656.976s">And</a> then if we agree that this is the right set of rules, then somebody needs to go through the policies and put motions on the floor to remove the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=669.346s">But</a> I don't think it's even worth talking about removing a policy if we haven't agreed what a new policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=675.228s">So</a> I would propose we go through this document, we agree on how we believe that this body should operate, and then there needs to be an effort to go back to the policy manual and identify those places where there's conflict and they get simply removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=696.797s">I</a> would like to see us move through this document without delay, because I do think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=702.823s">Clearly,</a> we've been mishmashing these things together and causing confusion for a really long time, so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=825.465s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=827.639s">I</a> would recommend that we talk about that as it applies to a specific rule instead of hypothetically, because hypothetically speaking, we could run around this circle all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=840.126s">And</a> I think if we have a rule and there is a policy that's in conflict, we should talk about it and we should identify what to do about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=848.171s">But</a> I think we should just, I think we just need to start at the top and work our way through this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=854.115s">And</a> if there are those conflicts, we just need to identify them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=857.17s">as</a> they come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=858.472s">And</a> if this is not perfect, it's fine because we can change a rule at any point in time going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=865.18s">This</a> is not like something we need to sign in blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=869.425s">So</a> I think we should do our level best to get through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=875.103s">do</a> our level best to clean up the policies because frankly, no one's done that in like 20, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=879.726s">So</a> all the efforts are welcome because I think they all create a better function. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=888.171s">And</a> if we find something in a week, we just need to deal with it in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=891.913s">And</a> I think it's all gonna be okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1323.033s">I</a> am in favor of having a meeting in the month of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1328.396s">I</a> think it's really completely reasonable to expect a body that is responsible for the schools in our district to meet before the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1339.523s">So</a> it doesn't have to be a long meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1341.724s">I</a> like that it could be remote to the extent that that remains an option, but I am in favor of an August meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1735.996s">If</a> I'm correct, <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1737.91s">Even</a> if we voted to approve this document tonight, they would not be adopted until this also goes to the floor for a regular meeting so my suggestion would just be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1749.81s">that</a> not happen until we also put on our agenda, whatever the next agenda is that we can put it on, the things that need to be struck from the policy handbook, like policy BE, like motion to rescind policy BE, and then it can have a week of waiting and be adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1768.473s">I</a> think it is literally as simple as that and we should not make it more complicated.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=265.523s">a</a> substantive change from what the policy used to be, or the policy was just sort of silent on how and when and why do subcommittees meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=273.465s">So</a> this says that subcommittees meet when business has been passed to them by the committee, which is consistent with typical legislative action. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=285.168s">And</a> then other than that, I may have made some changes to like chairperson instead of chairman and those kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=294.553s">The</a> cross references to other policies exist already and are part of the policy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=300.158s">And</a> I didn't make any changes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=305.182s">So</a> the two substantive changes are just striking the names of those committees from the policy and clarifying how things can be discussed in subcommittee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=327.04s">Yes,</a> it looks like it should say subcommittees will. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=334.506s">And</a> I think it's important to note that the policy says that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=338.769s">That</a> is not an addition or a change to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=344.915s">I</a> know there were comments about that being confusing or like what that meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=349.477s">I</a> just want to point out that that is our policy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=352.979s">So</a> it is confusing, but it shouldn't preclude making the other changes that are listed here.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=413.888s">In</a> number three, I don't know who does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=416.571s">It</a> is part of our policy today.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1917.718s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1918.018s">And</a> through the chair to member Kreatz, I think that's exactly how it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1921.4s">And</a> I think the benefit of <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1924.999s">doing</a> it this way is that in the example of this sign, I think we're going to talk tonight about the fact that we're at a real crossroads with the Medford High building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1938.131s">And</a> I mean, honestly, the community has been talking about that for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1942.275s">And</a> I do think without a plan, there's always this question of, is it worth spending this money right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1950.001s">And</a> I think on the one hand, I generally feel like it is worth spending the money right now to do the things that make the students there right now have a better educational experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1961.369s">And</a> maybe that's a sign, but we also don't have an endless supply of money and <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1968.178s">we</a> don't get to make decisions about all the things that we think that they should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1971.721s">Sometimes</a> there are choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1973.583s">And</a> if that came before this committee, we could have had a dialogue about it and provided some instruction or some like guidance to the subcommittee so that then the discussion could be productive and not sort of have the potential to like increase the level of expectation about what we're going to accomplish with this sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1996.629s">only</a> to have it come back here and for people to say, Oh no, that's too, like, that's way more than I think we should spend on a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2003.415s">So</a> I think the benefit of that is like this community, this committee gets to have some dialogue before we send you off to spend your time and your energy and John McLaughlin off to spend his time, his energy and the superintendent and all the people who go to the meetings and like <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2020.26s">setting</a> expectations or implying to the community that we're going to do something if we actually never intended to do that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2027.094s">So</a> I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2029.228s">Having</a> that collaboration discussion here is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2033.31s">And</a> I would say to the CPAC, I always want to hear what the CPAC has to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2038.393s">I</a> enjoy when they come and present annually to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2042.355s">And</a> I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a committee like that to have a meeting on an annual basis to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2052.76s">what</a> the CPAC's goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2054.181s">I</a> think it should tie to the significant presentation and all the effort they put in here, but the timing of that is certainly up to the chair of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2063.205s">But</a> I do wanna hear from the CPAC before we go off and spin up something in subcommittee that maybe doesn't have the support here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2073.989s">So</a> I think A, this committee really does wanna hear from folks like the CPAC and the DELAC and all the other community groups, and B, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2082.312s">you</a> know, I want to see us understand that we have the option. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2086.154s">We</a> would always have the option to put a resolution on to say, please go meet with the CPAC and ask them what their goals are for the year and what they want to see or what their problems of, you know, what are the problems that they think are most pressing? <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2096.899s">I</a> think that's perfect work for subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2099.841s">I</a> just don't think it should happen without this committee having eyes on it first.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3130.463s">So</a> I think to Member Kreatz's point, we should add to number three, a sentence that says subcommittees may meet at the beginning of each school year to conduct one meeting where a listening session with members of the community occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3153.771s">And</a> then I would make a motion to approve this as amended.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3239.418s">I,</a> I am not in favor of that amendment to the motion that I have on the floor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3343.406s">Mayor,</a> the agenda does say that we're discussing the structure and function, so I think it's reasonable for us to talk about the structure of the assignments.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3376.6s">It's</a> my understanding that the way that <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3378.628s">that</a> the subcommittee works today is there are actually two subcommittees really happening in one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3384.211s">One</a> is special education and one is behavioral health. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3387.773s">And</a> they're two different topics that do sometimes bring different folks to the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3394.556s">And</a> I am gonna make an assumption that really just special education should be struck from the second one, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3406.07s">The</a> first one is pupil services, which obviously includes special education, and the second is behavioral health. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3410.913s">And</a> then there are two, and then they can deal with whatever topics are appropriate for their own areas.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3441.916s">So</a> could we just remove pupil services as a subcommittee?<h2><a href="../2022-01-24_DnBk5C8-dFs/2022-01-24_DnBk5C8-dFs.html">1.24.2022 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.363s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.803s">Um,</a> I had a couple of questions as, as I was looking through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1198.905s">So</a> when you say this, the scope of this initial piece is HR, can you give us a sense of what that means to you in terms of the things and systems and types of procedures that you are going to be looking at in this phase?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1288.701s">Sort</a> of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1290.381s">So</a> I think the question maybe is for Dr. Edward-Vincent, how has HR been defined here in Medford Public Schools for this equity audit to be completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1300.794s">Like</a> what is the definition we're working against?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1472.262s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1473.423s">That</a> helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1474.124s">And</a> I guess the other question I had is when you say we, who do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1479.428s">And</a> was the racial equity task force involved in the like scope selection here, or is this something that the administration has decided?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1528.339s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1529.08s">And</a> can you just tell us how long you expect this work to take in this first phase?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1586.977s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1587.457s">Very</a> sorry for your loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1588.638s">Thanks</a> for the presentation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2945.503s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2946.564s">So</a> in mid February, when we shift our contact tracing efforts, I just want to make sure what I think you mean is really what you mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2955.329s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2957.395s">Parents</a> should really at after that point not expect to get a call saying their child was a close contact of somebody who tested positive in full testing and therefore has to stay home because they are unvaccinated or. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2973.254s">they</a> get a call saying your child was a close contact and they're vaccinated to watch for symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2977.776s">So</a> what we're saying is that communication that's happening right now will stop for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2984.88s">And</a> instead, students vaccinated and unvaccinated will have access to at-home tests so that if they see symptoms, they can test right there on the spot and know whether their child is positive or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3001.269s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3127.394s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3128.874s">And</a> then I think the other question that I had, and maybe this is a question for, can you provide this to us in some fashion in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3138.299s">So</a> my understanding is, in general and here in Medford, people that we have excluded from school because they are close contacts really fairly rarely have ultimately tested positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3154.234s">for</a> COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3154.914s">So</a> that's one piece of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3158.195s">I</a> would just like somebody to be able to validate or say yes, that I don't even need like precise numbers, but that yes, that's generally what we're finding and it's holding through this surge. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3169.417s">I</a> think that would be really helpful for people to know.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3236.227s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3236.487s">And</a> I, the reason that I say that is because I think, you know, families are sort of in this constant assessment of risk mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3247.289s">And</a> every time there's a change in the program that sort of brings <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3251.647s">the</a> sort of need to like reassess how I'm assessing risk personally to the surface again, to say, you know, am I comfortable? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3261.791s">Am</a> I uncomfortable? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3263.292s">Does</a> this create unnecessary, you know, does this create an intolerable amount of risk for my family because I have somebody who's very ill at home or whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3270.514s">So</a> just, you know, any data points or messages of clarification that you could share about that would, I think would be helpful to some. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3279.058s">And</a> I think to others, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3281.131s">as</a> you mentioned, if they have been that person, it's not going to matter that much to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3284.554s">But</a> I think for those folks who are really, um, concerned as this, as this shifting happens, I do want to try to address their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3295.142s">And</a> I think the other piece of data that I, um, is like gets harder and harder to parse every single day is this like overwhelming feeling that, you know, all of these people who are vaccinated, who have COVID and, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3308.705s">I</a> don't think that's at, like, I think in the aggregate, the numbers are still quite substantially like indicating that vaccines are, they work and they're effective and all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3322.574s">So</a> I would be interested to know what data, if any, we have on breakthrough infections in our student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3331.68s">And</a> I don't know, like, again, I don't need you to answer it today, but just, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3337.772s">something</a> about those two questions, I think, would be very helpful for people to understand.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3406.678s">And</a> then I also wondered if you could, or if you had any information about the media reports that we're seeing about the legislature taking votes to send improved quality masks for students or DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3423.564s">There's</a> been various <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3428.038s">publications,</a> you know, down the, down the chain of politics around what is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3434.102s">And</a> I just am curious, like, are there masks coming for kids or do we not know?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=4607.162s">Sorry,</a> I just had a relatively quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=4610.345s">When</a> we approved the strategic plan last spring, I think one of the things we talked about was that there was a lot of discussion about our mission and vision statement in the various listening sessions that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=4622.794s">And</a> we did put it on the agenda for this year to actually revisit those statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=4628.138s">So</a> I was curious when we plan to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7109.91s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7113.993s">There</a> have been instances in the past where the administration has sort of sought our <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7120.467s">input,</a> and we've been able to individually provide that input on whatever topic it was to you, and then you've had the ability to then see sort of across the spectrum of everybody's priorities, what are we all saying, and then come back to us with <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7141.237s">a</a> presentation or a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7142.878s">And</a> it seems to me like that's really what we need to accomplish here is we all individually need to be able to tell you what is important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7152.383s">And</a> then honestly, there's going to be lots of overlap, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7157.285s">Across</a> the committee in various ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7160.907s">And</a> then you need to come and present a budget to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7163.408s">So</a> I sort of am a fan of the notion that you would collect that input from us individually, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7172.242s">and</a> then you would present to us on night and maybe we'd like cancel the second school committee meeting in March and instead we do budget night and you come to us and you say on the you know at the what would normally be the second school committee meeting here here is our set of priorities here is what the budget looks like and then as committee members <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7194.763s">if</a> I've said these are my 10 things that I want to see in the budget, you've covered eight of them, I don't have to talk about eight of the 10 things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7203.952s">And</a> I do want to, I do want to hear the cohesive message from the superintendent about where the district is going, because I think the other thing that has happened, that happens in those committee of the wholes, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7219.681s">is</a> people react to the information they're being given, which may or may not actually be material to formulating, like, what do you think about the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7230.766s">And</a> I do think that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7232.067s">I</a> think it's a point, like, I think a lot of people view those meetings as a point to learn a lot about the organization, which can be valuable, but I think it can be just as valuable for <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7244.153s">the</a> those those department heads to really think about the narratives that they're providing us instead of like rinse repeating them every year because they look exactly the same every year but instead to say we've got this opportunity put your narratives together so that they can be rolled up um <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7262.172s">and</a> we start with a night where you tell us what you think the priorities are, and then we figure out from that night what has to happen next. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7271.455s">Do</a> we need a deep dive into something or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7275.657s">So</a> that would be my suggestion of what the process could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7279.938s">You</a> are independently soliciting input from us between now and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7283.44s">You</a> are putting together your vision of what this budget needs to look like to meet the goals and objectives that <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7290.412s">you</a> have and that we have indicated to you and then you come back and present it and then we take from there like where the you know where there is you know a discrepancy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7974.86s">I</a> would, on the topic of transparency, I would implore the administration to stop rinse repeating the narratives that come to us in the budget and really think thoughtfully about like the questions that we ask again and again, every single year, like, why are there two gym teachers at the Missittuck and not at any other elementary school? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8000.103s">If</a> there's a rational answer for that, that we can articulate and define, I think it would serve us all because we forget what that answer is when it gets verbally delivered to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8010.358s">Or</a> why do we dole out? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8016.302s">office</a> supply budgets as though there's the same number of kids in every school when there's a hundred less kids in one elementary school than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8024.244s">So</a> there are questions that we ask that draw out those conversations that we ask every year, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8032.347s">And</a> it's a missed opportunity for the documentation to tell a story, not just to us, but more importantly to the community who may or may not want to sit through many, many hours of meetings that <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8046.581s">We</a> are interested in telling a story about how we spend our money because I think it's critically important and it lends itself to the confidence that the community has that we're spending money thoughtfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8057.705s">So</a> there is an opportunity there and maybe it doesn't look as pretty as the municipal budget does this year, but the quality of the information can improve with the collective force of the organization deciding that's important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9909.313s">So</a> at the last meeting, I think there's two, there's two different parts of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9914.056s">One</a> is there's an email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9916.999s">people</a> can write to us at that still exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9921.241s">What</a> is different now is that that just will auto forward to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9924.962s">So</a> we all get to see what is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9927.904s">Okay,</a> that is different than <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9932.345s">what</a> we did in the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9934.046s">So</a> that's not, that part is sort of new, which we did in the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9937.689s">The</a> other thing we did in last week's meeting was say, we are no longer going to read all of those things out at school committees, because instead we're sending it to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9949.238s">We</a> all can ask those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9951.62s">So</a> all this is doing is truing up the policy with the vote that we took last week, which was to say, if you would like to speak at school committee meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9961.502s">You</a> can continue to do so in person and you can continue to do so on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9966.683s">Separately,</a> you can write and all of us will get your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9970.704s">We</a> may choose to ask those questions or whatever it is in the meeting, or we may reach out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9977.525s">But</a> if you want to participate in the meetings, you're not emailing us a laundry list of questions anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9987.827s">You</a> are either coming in person or coming on Zoom to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9991.401s">the</a> email address continuing to be operational is important because then we all six can see, seven, can see what is coming into that email box and figure out how we each individually want to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10004.692s">That</a> is what we did last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10005.893s">And</a> all this is doing is changing our policy to reflect that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10375.147s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10376.008s">Motion</a> to approve with the amendment that for the remainder of the school year, we will add a note that says, please note your email to the Medford School Committee email address has been automatically forwarded to all six members of the committee and will not be read, seven, sorry, and will not be read into the record as has been past practice.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11221.025s">Can</a> we do Thursday the third on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11224.407s">So</a> we can actually look at the document?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11232.069s">Yes,</a> yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11848.221s">I</a> think the first step in the process is for the member to lay out what the request is, which this does, and for us to take a vote that we agree that this is something worthy of spending time on, which I think is what we would do if we voted on this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11865.052s">And</a> then if the superintendent has any amendments to offer now or needs to come back to us at another point in time, that's the next step in the process, but it cannot happen until we take this vote, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12386.322s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12387.883s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12389.464s">So</a> this is written to align with our policy, which BDF is our policy around standing up <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12398.902s">advisory</a> committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12400.082s">And</a> so what that policy says, if you remember from the Missittuck renewing, is that this committee will decide the scope, the charge, the body, and how the body is selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12412.807s">So</a> that is work we will have to do between now and April 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12417.688s">in</a> order for them to be able to reconvene. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12419.709s">So</a> to be able to convene for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12421.71s">So</a> that work is on us according to our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12426.192s">All</a> this is saying is that we will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12429.213s">And</a> so the question of like, how will it be formed is a question for us when we meet in a committee of the whole to form that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12439.197s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12501.376s">Member</a> Graham, so will the committee decide that no? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12510.163s">That</a> ideally would not be the purpose of the committee because we need <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12514.793s">the</a> experts and the people with money at MSBA to do that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12520.738s">So</a> the goal is to make sure that we do not miss the window of the MSBA statement of interest application process and allow that work that the superintendent would do under this directive to help us inform the scope <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12537.027s">of</a> those next steps for the flagship committee to undertake. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12540.708s">And</a> that should help us, because if you remember back when we were talking about this originally, there was no scope yet written. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12548.79s">So</a> we picked a bunch of people, but we didn't tell them what the scope of their work was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12552.811s">And</a> everyone had a different idea of what they were going to do when they came to the first meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12557.452s">So</a> we need to do a good job of deciding what that scope is for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12562.718s">when</a> we formed the committee, but the goal is to let the MSBA process inform us and lead that in a productive direction rather than to have a committee that doesn't have a clear charge or has a charge that's in the worst case in conflict with what we need to do to stay on the MSBA timeline and engage with them as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12587.342s">So</a> all of that, that's sort of why the timing is MSBA first and then flagship committee second, so that we can have a better idea and understanding of the scope when we get together to form that committee.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_HmBWgU9QDwQ/2025-06-26_HmBWgU9QDwQ.html">Community Development Board 01-13-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=2449.723s">Yeah,</a> I just had a question on the road widening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=2451.745s">What</a> if a development is proposing <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=2455.387s">to</a> widen the road for whatever needs to happen for their development, was the intent of this section to also say, like, if that was to be approved, then here are standards that we want to make sure are incorporated? <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=2470.55s">It's</a> a different perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=2528.686s">Right,</a> just take out the widening and just say road intersection travels and traffic signal modification.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5722.097s">Yeah,</a> no, I didn't have any concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5723.737s">I</a> was just trying to figure out, like, how does this tie to leveraging these opportunities to get back mitigation or not mitigation, but some real benefits to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5738.8s">And</a> I'm not familiar with PDDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5741.521s">Like,</a> I just sort of was trying to relate it to plan development areas that I'm more familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5749.308s">in</a> Boston, which is actually those are very more prescriptive and they have very specific process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5756.271s">But</a> there's, there's like elements of like, if you come in with a proposal, and you want to get, you know, something larger or something, or it's a specific use, you know, the city would like to get, you know, a park out of it, or, you know, some community space. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5778.186s">or</a> something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5779.086s">So</a> I just wasn't sure like where, how does that get resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=5783.208s">Is</a> that just within the whole process of a potential developer coming in and saying, you know, here's my plan and then it's just a series of negotiations?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6234.167s">Just</a> one more clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6235.748s">So</a> the section that talks about small plan developments has a square footage, but up above, it's sort of like an open, it's open in terms of the size of these PDDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6252.053s">Like</a> how do you determine that if you're keeping it open in terms of what the size could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6261.241s">Like</a> there's no minimum size it says above. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6264.504s">Am</a> I reading these out of context?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6275.833s">But</a> up above, if you could scroll up, whoever has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6280.895s">where</a> it talks about the PD district does not have any minimum, okay, so that's a lot size, no minimum lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6288.982s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6292.626s">And</a> then down here is just, what's that, scores footage?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6322.756s">Well,</a> it just seems a little disjointed to me, but I'm probably not understanding because I'm not a land use attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6328.777s">But</a> usually like the square footage of a building ties to the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6335.059s">So</a> then you figure out like your density and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6339.289s">And</a> there's then a whole bunch of planning and decisions around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6343.312s">So</a> it just seems a little confusing to me, but that doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6505.408s">Where</a> did I tag that to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6510.232s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6515.395s">Oh,</a> yeah, I was just trying to make some sense of like the whole financial analysis section, which is going to suggest that there's like some impact and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6525.78s">Is</a> that impact? <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6530.243s">Can</a> that impact be dealt with by linkage? <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6534.565s">Or</a> is I didn't see any. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6538.487s">Where</a> that it addressed, like, getting money for housing and jobs within the city, you know, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6545.06s">It's</a> particularly like housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6547.181s">If</a> big commercial developments, you know are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6553.225s">Is</a> there a way to get linkage to go into, like an affordable housing fund or something so it's just, just a question I've seen linkage and other cities for housing and jobs and just wondering if that's something that would <a href="https://youtu.be/HmBWgU9QDwQ&t=6572.495s">be</a> considered here in Medford or it's dealt with in a different way.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6234.167s">Just</a> one more clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6235.748s">So</a> the section that talks about small plan developments has a square footage, but up above, it's sort of like an open, it's open in terms of the size of these PDDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6252.053s">Like</a> how do you determine that if you're keeping it open in terms of what the size could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6261.241s">Like</a> there's no minimum size it says above. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6264.504s">Am</a> I reading these out of context?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6275.833s">But</a> up above, if you could scroll up, whoever has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6280.895s">where</a> it talks about the PD district does not have any minimum, okay, so that's a lot size, no minimum lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6288.982s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6292.626s">And</a> then down here is just, what's that, scores footage?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6322.756s">Well,</a> it just seems a little disjointed to me, but I'm probably not understanding because I'm not a land use attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6328.777s">But</a> usually like the square footage of a building ties to the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6335.059s">So</a> then you figure out like your density and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6339.289s">And</a> there's then a whole bunch of planning and decisions around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6343.312s">So</a> it just seems a little confusing to me, but that doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6505.408s">Where</a> did I tag that to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6510.232s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6515.395s">Oh,</a> yeah, I was just trying to make some sense of like the whole financial analysis section, which is going to suggest that there's like some impact and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6525.78s">Is</a> that impact? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6530.243s">Can</a> that impact be dealt with by linkage? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6534.565s">Or</a> is I didn't see any. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6538.487s">Where</a> that it addressed, like, getting money for housing and jobs within the city, you know, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6545.06s">It's</a> particularly like housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6547.181s">If</a> big commercial developments, you know are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6553.225s">Is</a> there a way to get linkage to go into, like an affordable housing fund or something so it's just, just a question I've seen linkage and other cities for housing and jobs and just wondering if that's something that would <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6572.495s">be</a> considered here in Medford or it's dealt with in a different way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=6774.548s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=10971.961s">I</a> got to pick up my kid.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11276.494s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11279.115s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11348.392s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11348.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11349.813s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11350.253s">Have</a> a good night everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11351.353s">Bye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt0EnfVDBk0&t=11352.394s">Thank</a> you everybody.<h2><a href="../2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo/2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - January 10, 2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=248.312s">Jenny</a> Graham.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=267.877s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=276.84s">Mayor.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=279.502s">I'd</a> like to nominate Paul Rousseau for the role of secretary.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=714.803s">So</a> I just wanted to, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=719.984s">I</a> just wanted to say welcome to Sharon. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=723.359s">Thank</a> you for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=724.68s">We're</a> excited to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=725.66s">And</a> you should not hesitate to reach out to any of us if you have questions between now and then.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=773.441s">Mayor,</a> did we lose you? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=776.444s">I</a> see her square, but I don't know if she's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=787.461s">Okay,</a> well, I will do my best to take over while she deals with her technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=797.858s">Are</a> there any other comments under the good of the order?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3715.598s">Sorry,</a> I was on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3717.199s">Has</a> there been any talk amongst the CDC or the DPH about changes to the protocol for vaccinated students, meaning vaccinated students are not required to quarantine today if they are a close contact, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3731.706s">They're</a> only required to quarantine if they test positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3734.907s">Has</a> there been any discussion of a change to that with the <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3741.081s">sort</a> of significant spread happening with Omicron, or has that not been in the medical realm?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3771.38s">So</a> we're not foreseeing a change that would require vaccinated students to do something different than they are doing today.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3819.13s">And</a> are we seeing or is there data available at the state level yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3824.135s">I</a> know there's a lot of talk about breakthrough infections and I know plenty of folks who are fully vaccinated adults who have experienced breakthrough infections. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3833.123s">Is</a> there data about breakthrough infections amongst our school age population yet that is worth discussing just in terms of like the data points that it might provide?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3963.944s">And</a> last week, leading up to the vaccine clinics, I heard and saw a number of people <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3972.773s">commenting</a> about how the system was full and it wasn't at various points in time, but I think the question I have is like, is there a lit, like if a thousand people showed up on Wednesday, do you have a thousand doses to dish out or is there an upper limit? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=3989.724s">Like,</a> I just want as many people to go to those clinics as possible because the way for your child to go to school every day is for them to get fully vaccinated, which does take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4002.052s">the</a> sooner you start, the sooner you can sort of be in that clear space.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4233.266s">And</a> Mayor, I just had one more request. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4237.01s">When</a> we communicate about this change that's upcoming to the guidance, I think we need to be really abundantly clear about what an in school exposure is and what it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4248.541s">So</a> I'm, I'm assuming that if your child is exposed <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4253.117s">through</a> youth sports in Medford that that does not qualify as an in school exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4258.262s">I</a> don't know what that means for like school sponsored athletics, but I just want us to be really like upfront and clear about which exposures count because my. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4271.963s">My</a> commentary from folks in other districts are that there's like really very few people getting COVID from school, which means there's very few people doing test and stay, but it doesn't mean that kids are not exposed elsewhere, but they will not qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4288.056s">They</a> will still have to quarantine if they are exposed elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4292.219s">So</a> I just want to make sure that all of those <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4295.236s">like</a> car bots are really clear to people so that, you know, if and when their child is exposed that it's clear what that means based on like where that exposure came from.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4806.297s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4807.819s">I</a> think the mayor may be having some technical challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4811.982s">I</a> think my question is really around those parents who are actively inquiring about the results of the first assessment being told that they can't see them until the second assessment is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4825.519s">And</a> at the middle school level, I think that is a huge struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4831.226s">There</a> are no parent teacher conferences built into the academic curriculum for middle school families. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4837.153s">And</a> right now, there's lots of families who are <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4840.438s">disproportionately</a> involved in their child's education with kids being out on quarantine and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4846.28s">And</a> I'm just struggling with the wisdom of telling parents that they have to wait until February to understand sort of where their kids are at baseline, if the school knows this information.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4933.613s">I</a> think the other question I had, we had on the list of approved reports that the school committee passed a year ago or so, we had routine aggregated reports for the screener tools being used at the early literacy level, and I haven't seen them yet, but I wanna make sure that this committee is getting results each and every time these tests are administered so that we can understand <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4960.632s">at</a> baseline where folks are, what the growth opportunities are, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4964.974s">I</a> know map is a new tool, but I've been on the committee for two years now and I've never seen an aggregated report that's been produced out of a screener. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4973.238s">So</a> I think that was approved by this committee in the last year and a half or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4979.441s">And</a> I would like to see those reports be presented to us in a more systemic fashion going forward so that we can have some understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4989.369s">you</a> know, the, where our students are at, because we actually are responsible for academic success and we have zero tools really to know that right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5050.882s">Yeah,</a> and I I've heard very good things about the quality of the data that can be provided to us, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5058.084s">I</a> think my final question is this withholding of information from parents happening this year because it's the first outing will not happen next year during the first test. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5067.987s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=5095.11s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6672.469s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6673.229s">I</a> think we've talked in past years about the before and after school program being a considerable challenge for families on a whole number of fronts, but one of the biggest of which is access to the program, because there's just simply not enough of it to go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6692.235s">And</a> I think last year when we talked about the rate increase, which was, I believe, tied to <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6700.987s">the</a> increases associated with the voucher program, we indicated at that time that we wanted to see the rate increases be more commiserate with making sure that the program could be expanded and could take into account the costs of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=6715.82s">And</a> I know all of this happens, kindergarten registration just opened, and I wanna make sure we're in a position to set these rates sooner rather than later so that registration can open for the program.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7080.094s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7082.195s">As</a> we were thinking, as I was thinking about subcommittees as we go forward, one of the things that struck me as awkward about the way that our subcommittees are handled today is that they tend to have a lot of different topics, so sort of all lumped in together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7100.695s">And</a> I know that I would personally like to see the committees be a little bit more sort of finite and clear, but that would, I think likely mean as we think about committees for this term, more committees than we have today, which I know is sort of undesirable for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7118.73s">And</a> the changes, and I sent you all a document that actually outlines the changes in track mode so that you can see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7126.917s">but</a> a couple of the, I think the significant changes was just to strike the name of the committees from the policy and just say that they are subject to the organization of the committee at the beginning of the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7139.485s">And</a> then number three being, I think the significant change, which is that the subcommittees really should only be meeting if they are carrying out business that's been sent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7151.387s">by</a> the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7152.707s">And</a> I know when I started, there was some conversation about how that's traditionally done, but also that there isn't a rule written down anywhere to the rules conversation earlier that says that that is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7166.411s">And</a> I do think if we are going to move to a model that where there's more finite subcommittees, I think it would be really important for us to make sure that the committee as a whole is voting to send things to subcommittees so that <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7178.795s">the</a> subcommittees are spending time on things that have this sort of conceptual and general support of the entire committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7185.08s">And</a> then I think there's just a couple of other changes around language of chair versus chairperson and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7191.185s">But</a> those were the two big changes that I am proposing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7608.195s">Mayor</a> can I, could I respond to that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7614.325s">So</a> I think in that case I think actually that's a really good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7618.027s">So</a> in that case, what you would be doing is putting an agenda, a resolution on our standing agenda saying the building and ground subcommittee is be resolved that they will hold a meeting that discusses bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7632.293s">at</a> our various properties and we would all say yes or no to that, and that would be your signal, assuming it's a yes, that would be your signal to then go ahead and schedule your meeting as you see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7643.503s">I</a> think that also would be a clear directive that being held off because of an election or <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7650.109s">something's</a> people being too busy, like all of those reasons why meetings get held off go away, because the committee has then said, this is something we collectively want to put our energy behind, we want to hear from a subcommittee, we want you to go off and do this work, go off and do this work and come back and report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7671.246s">That</a> is how it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7672.646s">So</a> you would just put it on this agenda, we would vote on it, we'd send it to your subcommittee and then you'd be free to meet like you always have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7679.211s">I</a> think the challenge is when we all have items that we think we should be meeting about that may or may not have the support of the whole committee, that requires a lot of time from the administration and their time is money because we pay them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7696.561s">And</a> when they're in our subcommittee meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7699.423s">potentially</a> talking about things that don't have the support of the entire committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7703.984s">We're</a> spending their time and more importantly, taking them away from things that do have the support of the entire committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7709.005s">So</a> that's the goal there is just to firm up our rules of operation around how do things get to subcommittee so that the community who tunes into these meetings, but maybe not the larger set of, you know, hundreds of subcommittee meetings across the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7726.175s">can</a> anticipate when something is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7728.217s">I</a> know there's been plenty of times that had I known what was on the building and ground subcommittee agenda I would have probably attended because I was surprised to hear that things like boilers and things in like big ticket items frankly are being discussed in subcommittee that haven't been discussed here so <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7744.654s">I</a> think it's just a better way to say this is what the priority of the committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7749.458s">There's</a> agreement to talk about this or to take some sort of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7754.723s">And</a> then that also gives clarity to the administration what we're asking them to work on and what we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7760.788s">So</a> that is the goal of number three.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7922.594s">So,</a> I mean, I guess member cuts in that case, if you had four items, you could put a resolution that contains the four items. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7929.238s">And</a> then if the committee for some reason felt like item number three was not something they could, you know, there could be a motion to sever that out of your resolution and it could be voted on separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7938.743s">But</a> I think the bigger concern is to make sure that if you are going to go and ask the administration to prepare <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7949.249s">a</a> presentation and an agenda and all those other things that this committee agrees that those four items are things that A, should be talked about at all and B, should be talked about in that subcommittee versus maybe there's something we would say, gee, I really think that should be something for a regular school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7966.142s">So</a> yeah, I think, you know, if they were really different items or they came up over time, you could have many different resolutions, but I wouldn't see any reason to preclude you from also just having one resolution that says here's the, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7978.612s">you</a> know, here's the things I want to schedule a meeting about. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7980.433s">I</a> think both ways work as long as this voting body says, yes, we agree that that is worth spending our time on.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=2186.576s">So</a> today is the eighth regular meeting of the Medford School Committee, Monday, December 20th, 2021, 6.30, to be held here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3200.725s">Are</a> we considering having school day oriented vaccination clinics, particularly at the younger levels where kids are not able to navigate themselves around wherever it is that they need to go?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3418.206s">Glucy,</a> just a couple of questions, both on the breakdown of the schools and the asterisk at the bottom of the kindergarten enrollment breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3427.409s">So</a> the asterisk says an additional 11 kindergarten students are assigned to specialized classroom <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3432.375s">classrooms</a> district-wide based on their IEP needs, which looks like it changes the number from 357 to 368. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3440.48s">So</a> I'm wondering, are they not included in the total of the September or December enrollment in each of the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3449.045s">Like</a> why are they segregated out in this section?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3486.354s">And</a> then, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3487.295s">And</a> then in the breakdown of the schools that has the numbers per classroom breakdown, that just seems different than what you're saying around the five and the two.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3510.111s">Yes,</a> currently there are no kindergarten students enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3513.615s">Right,</a> so they're not on that number, but I mean on this on this on this breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3517.342s">Do</a> you have this right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3518.484s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3519.426s">So</a> on the breakdown for that sheet for grade five, is there a language based classroom included in this grade five?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3536.992s">Like</a> I didn't ask for the district wide specific breakdown, including all programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3542.136s">I</a> just wanted her to focus on the kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3544.297s">I</a> know you have all of the classrooms here, but yeah, I can run another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3549.0s">Yeah,</a> that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3550.041s">Thank</a> you, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3550.742s">Because</a> it doesn't, yeah, it wasn't inclusive of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3553.585s">So</a> I want to make sure that everyone's included on this breakdown for the classroom so that we can better understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3558.03s">And</a> then also, I know in the, in the NISITUC, you have the programmatic elements or somebody has the programmatic elements in parenthetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3567.48s">I'm</a> assuming NC for that four is newcomer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3570.976s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3571.336s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3572.297s">TLP</a> is Therapeutic Learning Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3574.158s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3660.199s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3661.119s">There</a> are some on the other schools though that are one and two superintendents, so that's what I'm just asking, just that way if we can be <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3668.442s">However</a> you guys want to do it if it's just consistent across the schools that's what would be most helpful for me to see and that we're obviously that we're being inclusive and then I didn't see that so the only EL breakdown is the newcomer for fourth grade from Miss attack right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3694.475s">And</a> that's listed by the teacher's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3696.056s">So</a> when I run the next report, I'll make sure that I have the. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3700.398s">just</a> helps give a picture of across this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3702.799s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3801.117s">Some</a> students, many of these families that are coming in are also indicating on the transition forms that English is not the language spoken at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3809.601s">So</a> that requires Mr. Teixeira's staff to do an assessment, a language assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3816.244s">If</a> the child is also coming in with any sort of special education services or any health related issues, it depends on how long. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3823.668s">It</a> also depends on if the parent is current and up with all of the requirements in terms of documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=3831.891s">So</a> it could be as quick as just a few days or as long as a week or two.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=5616.534s">So</a> I'm going to hand it over to our colleague member Graham for this Massachusetts State Senate official citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=5626.583s">So</a> President Spoka, Clerk Hurley, and Senator Jalen have sent along the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Senate official citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=5637.809s">Be</a> it known that the Massachusetts Senate hereby extends its congratulations to Paulette Vander Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=5644.332s">In</a> recognition of your 32 years of outstanding and dedicated service to the Medford School Committee, and be it further known that the Massachusetts Senate extends its best wishes for continued success, that this citation be duly signed by the President of the Senate and attested to in a copy that are transmitted to the Clerk of the Senate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6113.692s">I</a> forgot my own remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6115.453s">So</a> I two years ago when I was out campaigning I knocked on a woman's door. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6130.482s">And</a> we had a like 20 minute long conversation at her door. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6134.605s">And</a> I think she said that her kids went to school with Paulette's kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6139.008s">And</a> she said, do you know Paulette? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6141.289s">And</a> I said, why, yes, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6143.611s">We</a> had worked on the superintendent search committee together that ultimately hired you, superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6149.394s">Good</a> job, good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6153.759s">And</a> also, we had worked on a number of things together when I was a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6159.143s">And</a> this woman said, well, you know, before Paulette, parents weren't members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6165.688s">And</a> I said, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6167.99s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6168.67s">And</a> I didn't know, but I was like, and she said, but Paulette is the one that changed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6172.974s">Paulette</a> is the reason why there are parents on the school committee today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6176.056s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZ9m9T3NFVU&t=6304.729s">On</a> behalf of the administration, the entire Medford School, public school community, we have the honor of presenting this final gift, which has an inscription here.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6528.112s">Well,</a> can I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6529.232s">Does</a> it make sense if as a board, we sort of narrow down the list of what we feel <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6538.532s">as</a> a board are the most critical components and then hone in on those because some are just whatever, but some are pretty material. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6547.215s">And</a> so which ones as a board do we feel are the most material that need to, that deeper dive and set a process for that within a reasonable timeframe and for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6560.96s">I</a> just, I wasn't at the last meeting personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6565.971s">I</a> didn't, I don't have the benefit of those discussions just sort of reading the notes after, so I don't have a lot of context of the discussion, but, you know, a lot of things around housing and I'd like to take a closer look at, or the things that David has raised, I'd like to take a closer look at, but I think all of us probably have <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6591.055s">things</a> that are more important to us, but if we maybe just sort of narrow it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6595.138s">I</a> don't know if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6596.319s">I'm</a> just trying to get to a place where we can decide like these are the most material things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6779.802s">Before</a> we had divided and conquered, we paired up and said, you two people look at these sections that you may be more interested in or <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6793.227s">align</a> with our experience and, you know, take a look at those, develop your comments on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=6798.652s">So</a> I don't know if that's a way to do it where, you know, we can just, everybody takes certain sections and says, and just focuses on those, gets their comments in before the 5th, and then planning can compile all that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7284.556s">Well,</a> so for instance, you don't necessarily have to do the definition of family is just wrong, because I could see this could personally that could personally impact me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7294.761s">To</a> be honest, I have family that's not blood or married, and we live together as a family.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7832.104s">No,</a> I mean, I share the same interest in the sections that people have noted to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7839.147s">And</a> I think I'd really like to look at the special permit section again, and the residential section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7848.38s">in</a> more detail.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7911.692s">Well,</a> it should come with increased benefits to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7914.453s">I</a> mean, I think that's what really needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7918.675s">If</a> developers have the flexibility to get increased FAR or other uses, then <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7929.445s">that's</a> gonna be like the trade-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=7931.145s">So</a> I think it's really taking a look at that and making sure that it's balanced.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=8008.973s">I</a> hate the language the way that it's written now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=8014.316s">But</a> you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=8015.576s">I</a> think it's better to have <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=8017.758s">present</a> an alternative language, then just say, take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=8022.462s">Might</a> get, might have a little more legs with a proposal for editing.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=6779.802s">Before</a> we had divided and conquered, we paired up and said, you two people look at these sections that you may be more interested in or <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=6793.227s">align</a> with our experience and, you know, take a look at those, develop your comments on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=6798.652s">So</a> I don't know if that's a way to do it where, you know, we can just, everybody takes certain sections and says, and just focuses on those, gets their comments in before the 5th, and then planning can compile all that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7284.556s">Well,</a> so for instance, you don't necessarily have to do the definition of family is just wrong, because I could see this could personally that could personally impact me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7294.761s">To</a> be honest, I have family that's not blood or married, and we live together as a family.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7832.104s">No,</a> I mean, I share the same interest in the sections that people have noted to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7839.147s">And</a> I think I'd really like to look at the special permit section again, and the residential section. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7848.38s">in</a> more detail.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7911.692s">Well,</a> it should come with increased benefits to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7914.453s">I</a> mean, I think that's what really needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7918.675s">If</a> developers have the flexibility to get increased FAR or other uses, then <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7929.445s">that's</a> gonna be like the trade-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=7931.145s">So</a> I think it's really taking a look at that and making sure that it's balanced.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=8008.973s">I</a> hate the language the way that it's written now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=8014.316s">But</a> you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=8015.576s">I</a> think it's better to have <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=8017.758s">present</a> an alternative language, then just say, take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=8022.462s">Might</a> get, might have a little more legs with a proposal for editing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=10721.435s">Thanks,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR69NaHZbkw&t=10722.015s">Have</a> a good night.<h2><a href="../2021-12-06_znVC7Rz2lFI/2021-12-06_znVC7Rz2lFI.html">12.06.2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6293.141s">Can</a> you just clarify for me how many school Councilors, how many adjustment Councilors, and how many school psychologists are at the high school right now?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6315.379s">And</a> how does that compare to what we would expect to see in a high school of our size?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6397.868s">So</a> I think the other question I have is, is it clear to students and families how to engage with these supports at school?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6428.525s">And</a> how do we make sure that families who are experiencing crisis of some kind, big or small, <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6439.656s">can</a> come to us with those concerns and get help. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6446.121s">And</a> I say that because I've heard from people over the last couple of days who feel like they are reaching out to try to get help. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6455.189s">And</a> there's a lot of sympathy for what's going on for them, but <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6462.443s">saying</a> to people, we're here if you need us, tell us what you need is often not sufficient for somebody who's going through something they've never experienced before. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6471.067s">So</a> that just really struck a chord with me that if parents are reaching out because they don't know what to do, we have to find a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6482.132s">And</a> I'm not saying necessarily that the school has to provide the thing that fills the gap, but parents by and large are not trained Councilors and <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6491.837s">there's</a> a real opportunity for us as a district to help them understand what to do, where to go, who to reach out to, how school can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6501.123s">And</a> I feel like we're not getting that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6504.306s">And</a> I feel like, you know, family members, community members who are struggling with whatever they may be struggling with feel sort of lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6514.193s">And</a> I think that's sort of a bigger <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6516.906s">There's</a> a problem in our culture right like when people have problems, particularly that are that rise to the level of crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6525.389s">There's,</a> there's a lot of folks who don't want to reach out for help because they're, they're concerned about what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6532.091s">I</a> think what I've been hearing is that there are some folks out there who want the help and feel like they're not getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6539.014s">And</a> then there are some folks who don't feel like they have a level of trust or connection to our school system to think that we could provide help. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6550.98s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6552.08s">that</a> to me is like just another symptom of some of the systemic things that are broken that we need to fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6559.346s">And</a> we really need to think about how do we actually have a good relationship with families? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6566.291s">And</a> I think we've done a lot in the last couple of years to try to move there, but we still have such a long way to go that I want to encourage you and others <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6577.259s">Whether</a> it's at budget time or if it's something that you need more urgently and it can't wait till next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6584.061s">If</a> there are supports and resources that you need to start to create that kind of relationship with families, we want to hear about it because I speak for myself, I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6597.425s">We</a> need school and families to be on the same page and I don't feel like we are right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6625.18s">And</a> I think the other thing I wanted to mention that really both of our students alluded to was <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6633.422s">that</a> in the midst of our students saying to us, something is wrong here, that the overwhelming thing that they felt was that they faced like potential retaliation or potential consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6651.168s">And</a> so to the conversation around trust, certainly we need to be an organization that has <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6661.536s">clear</a> consequences when the rules are broken that fit the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6668.298s">But</a> the fact that our students trying to do something to make their school environment better came here to tell us that the first thing they felt was like they were gonna be retaliated against in some way is really disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6683.824s">And</a> I don't know what we need to do to fix that, but I think it's critically important that <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6690.066s">we</a> create students for the right now and for the future who are willing to make their environments better. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6697.572s">And</a> they can't do that if they're afraid of retaliation in school, which is supposed to be a safe place to learn how to do these things effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6707.66s">So</a> I'd like to hear a little bit more about what we're doing to fix that problem as well, because it's really, really, <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6721.155s">disheartening</a> and sad that our students felt like they, of all the comments, both of them at the top of your comments talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6730.903s">So</a> that means that really sticks out to our students and we need that not to be the first thing they want to tell us when they come here to address some issue that they're experiencing in school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9823.104s">Motion</a> to approve?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10527.906s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10529.646s">Yeah,</a> I can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10532.267s">So,</a> you know, as we have been navigating through all of what's been going on in the last week, I've had parents reach out to me and say things like, this is exactly what it felt like when I was a student before the race riots. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10548.251s">And</a> I've had parents reach out and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10553.433s">what</a> has changed since the gun magazine incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10559.618s">And</a> it strikes me that, you know, one of the reasons why I think we need this outside party to be involved in this conversation is because the things that require fixing here are very systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10572.348s">And</a> what ends up happening is we see something happen and the sort of problem bubbles to the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10583.393s">take</a> care of it for the moment, but we've never fundamentally changed the system underneath it that's fundamentally broken that needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10591.278s">And</a> I am really interested in taking a very systemically oriented approach here to solving this problem and really setting us with the help of experts on the right path <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10608.147s">um</a> that I see that as complementary to what you outlined earlier tonight and I'm not saying that our like our past handling has to do with with anybody in particular you at all anybody in particular it's just that as an as a community we've we've not done this well in terms of fixing systems that contribute <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10633.661s">to</a> climate and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10635.301s">And</a> so my interest in all of this is to say, if we are going to fix systemically what is wrong, we really don't have that expertise in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10647.764s">And</a> frankly, it's work beyond the scope of what we could reasonably expect our current staff to do, given all that else that they have to do in their regular day job. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10657.486s">So</a> when I say past handling, there are parallels to what we've seen in the last week, to what we have seen before at various points in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10668.052s">And</a> that doesn't get better without a lot of hard work and systemic change. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10671.855s">So</a> that is what I meant by the past handling comment, if that helps.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11161.722s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to clarify that we can get a survey for for a tiny bit of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11170.049s">But</a> what I am looking for from a scope perspective is more than just somebody to come in and administer a survey and give us the aggregated data and the work that it will take for them to digest that data <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11183.8s">and</a> talk to us, because I think they won't be able to give us quality recommendations without talking to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11190.962s">And</a> to give us recommendations that are actionable is why I felt strongly that we needed to have the room for the scope to play out the way that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11202.845s">Because</a> if we are going to make systemic change, it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11208.607s">There's</a> a reason we haven't done it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11214.877s">it</a> is more complicated than anybody wants it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11218.498s">So</a> I think we really need to impress upon the bidders of the scope that we aren't just looking for a survey, but we're looking for a deep dive of sorts so that we have an action plan that we can execute on when they're done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11365.77s">Actually,</a> Mayor, can we just say middle school? <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11369.013s">Because</a> I think a lot has changed in a very substantive way at middle school since that report has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11377.079s">We</a> have a lottery process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11379.34s">We</a> have two new building leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11382.923s">We</a> are trying to integrate those schools in a way that no one ever did before. <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11387.927s">So</a> I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11390.198s">If</a> we just say middle school, that gives us the flexibility to acknowledge that we have two, and a lot of things have changed since that last report.<h2><a href="../2021-11-15_Hr7vlJwC1Vw/2021-11-15_Hr7vlJwC1Vw.html">11.15.2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6509.083s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6510.644s">I</a> think last week we also talked about revising the ongoing process of capital planning, and we talked about doing that in January, February, pre-budget time, which I still think is a good time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6526.325s">And</a> I think we need to start to be exceedingly clear about when we're putting band-aids on things and when we're fixing things systemically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6533.667s">So</a> if we say we fix something three times, we put three band-aids on, we did not fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6538.569s">And</a> I think it's misleading and problematic when we tell the community we spent money and fix something, and then we have to tell them we need more money because we actually, turns out we didn't fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6548.692s">It</a> calls to question <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6550.352s">the</a> competence of us as a district, which I think is hugely problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6554.994s">I</a> think there's lots of cases where things that are unforeseen happen and band-aids are the actual only thing you can do in the moment so that you can continue to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6563.859s">But</a> as a committee, we need to get serious about all the things that require money in this district, roofs among them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6574.425s">We</a> have a whole bunch of buildings with end-of-life roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6579.227s">The</a> community is going to be shocked when we have roof problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6583.251s">If</a> we don't start to tell folks proactively what our plan is to fix the roofs and replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6589.538s">So</a> I think, you know, I know all of this costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6593.002s">I</a> know that's wildly unpopular to discuss, but I think our kids deserve to go to school and buildings that don't have roof problems that don't have leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6601.965s">and</a> that we are committed to the amount of preventative maintenance that allows us to make the most out of the life of our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6611.27s">And</a> when that life is over, we need to be in a position to take care of it before it's five years past the end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6620.134s">So</a> that we are not faced with situations like we frankly are right now across a myriad of issues where we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6627.792s">things</a> that need to be replaced and haven't been so to me like it's we can't keep saying we fix things if we put band-aids on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6638.274s">We</a> have to do capital planning in a serious way and in a thoughtful way so that we can contemplate the real cost of things and then we can communicate that through the budget process, through the capital improvement process, to the mayor, to the community, and to all the other people who are gonna ask to support us financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6660.264s">So</a> it's past time for us to do this and we need to start expeditiously.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7076.547s">So</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7077.888s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7079.637s">There</a> is no reason that the committee is prohibiting you all from hiring the best candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7086.985s">And</a> if that's not happening, that's a process issue that can be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7090.849s">And</a> you actually don't need our permission to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7093.832s">So</a> I hope that you will because having competitive hiring process is <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7099.008s">more</a> important than it's ever been in the right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7103.31s">So</a> I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7106.812s">Two</a> years ago, when we kicked off the budget process, we had a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7110.414s">And</a> one of the things we did in that committee of the whole was talk about what should the process look like and be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7116.598s">And</a> I'm not personally wed to the way that we handle our budget meetings or historically have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7125.56s">I</a> think that if we want to have a discussion about how we want that public process to work and where and when it happens, what I would suggest is that we have a committee of the whole that is dedicated to that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7141.893s">We</a> all agree on what that's going to look like so that when you <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7145.316s">give</a> us documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7146.857s">It</a> meets sort of what we were expecting it to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7149.398s">And</a> we can talk about a reasonable schedule that does not include having five meetings in the month of May to jam this in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7159.384s">And</a> maybe it does or doesn't include 25 or 30 administrators coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7164.928s">So</a> I think there's a whole bunch of opportunity for better process than we have today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=7171.271s">And</a> I am open to that discussion in January.<h2><a href="../2021-11-08_Sog9mTxuN90/2021-11-08_Sog9mTxuN90.html">COW Meeting:  MCAS Results</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1290.637s">I</a> actually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1292.439s">So,</a> you know, one of the things that I noticed particularly when you're talking about the student growth percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1298.584s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1299.144s">Is</a> how significantly different grade seven and eight were than really what looked pretty consistent across the rest of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1309.052s">Um</a> so, I was just curious if you had dug into like why those two grades so significantly <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1318.024s">outperformed</a> the state average versus like everyone else who didn't, but just sort of hovered underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1325.526s">So</a> I was just curious if there's something interesting going on there that you can share.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2040.574s">Through</a> the chair, Member McLaughlin, starting on page eight, the MCAS data listed there on the left column does talk about our participation percentage, which is obviously like it's broken down by school in these charts and by grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2059.645s">So</a> it's not aggregated, but I think overall the story is 97% participation across the state and our participation was less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2073.46s">which</a> varied grade to grade and school to school, but overall less. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2078.226s">And</a> I think my question is just, is that an oddity for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2085.035s">Do</a> we typically like run well below state average or is it just like
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2096.763s">Okay,</a> so that's where all that data is but it is at the grade and and building level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2105.247s">on</a> those charts in case you were looking for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2107.708s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=2108.708s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3056.611s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3058.672s">What</a> year did we fully implement FOSS?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3066.729s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3068.791s">And</a> you made a comment about how we did something different by providing all classrooms kits.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3086.665s">Okay,</a> can we make sure that continues to be the case even when the pandemic is over?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3090.789s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3093.305s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3094.166s">Um,</a> I was, I was actually honestly a little surprised that the, there was not like more lift in the fifth grade MCAS scores because we have FOSS in place and it's been there for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3107.295s">So,</a> um, I'm hoping that you all are looking at what supports <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3113.283s">perhaps</a> teachers need in terms of professional development to really allow that curriculum to shine, because I think it's a pretty fabulous curriculum overall, as we reviewed it many years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3126.052s">And</a> I think it has enormous potential for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3130.054s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can, so, I mean, everywhere else, we sort of stayed the same relative to the state or made a slight improvement at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3140.882s">It</a> was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3143.633s">we</a> closed the gap a bit, but at the elementary school, we went in the opposite direction, which isn't what I would have expected to see with the implementation of like a real cohesive curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3154.302s">So</a> just hoping we can take a look at that and figure out if there's something else going on that we need to address so that at budget time, you can bring that to us and we can take care of it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=3165.651s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=4982.494s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=4982.834s">Can</a> I just ask one quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=4986.455s">For</a> next year, is it possible that the department heads can get together and come up with a way that they're all going to display the same data so that when we're looking at charts between <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=4999.857s">English</a> and math and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=5001.778s">They</a> don't all look different even though the I mean, the data's all there but just as you're traveling across documents, it's very difficult to retrain how you're looking at the charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=5014.087s">Um</a> and it it seems to be like a standardization would make it easier for the department heads and for all for anybody who's looking at the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=5022.572s">So,</a> if we could just think about that next year so that the reports are a little more consistent one <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=5027.743s">one</a> subject matter to the next, that would be very helpful.<h2><a href="../2021-11-08_koyFP0ugilA/2021-11-08_koyFP0ugilA.html">Regular School Committee Meeting November 8, 2021</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=574.644s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2478.681s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2479.141s">And</a> I, I guess I would say the other variable that I heard at the conference was from districts that have very high vaccination rates, where then it is tenable to do things that we cannot do here because our vaccination rates just do not support that even at the upper levels where vaccines have been available for some amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2501.731s">So</a> if you have <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2504.065s">90%</a> of your kids who just get to the stay part of test and stay, you don't have to test them so that they can stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2512.57s">They</a> just get to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2514.992s">We</a> are not approaching 90% anytime soon that I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2520.615s">I'm</a> very hopeful and thankful that you all have moved faster than my child's pediatrician's office in not only setting up a clinic, but <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2529.141s">getting</a> shots in arms this week, so thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2534.705s">I</a> did have a question about once kids are in this like in-between phase where they've received one but not a second vaccination dose, are they stay or are they quarantine if they are identified as close contact?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2560.689s">Okay,</a> I just wanted to be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2563.95s">And</a> then I guess the other question that I had for you all is, I've been watching the changes to protocols that you've been rolling out, and you can observe in the data that they are working everywhere but the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2577.576s">So</a> I'm not seeing the same tick in the data when protocol changes are happening <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2586.711s">in</a> that building, and I'm just wondering why they are not working there in the same way that they are in other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2594.134s">And</a> I would like some information, I think, for parents who are especially frustrated there, parents who are sharing that the things we are saying are happening are not actually happening in the classroom that they are hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2606.579s">So</a> I'm just really confused as to what <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2609.347s">is</a> going on so uniquely in that building that is causing us to have to keep kids out of school in that building because that to me, it's about the kids being stuck at home without their peers, without their teachers, with their parents, you know, potentially, you know, these same kids could <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2629.868s">could</a> face that in the next five weeks again?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2742.512s">Yeah,</a> I would agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2743.472s">I</a> mean, I ask my own kids on a daily basis, how was school? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2747.994s">What</a> was going on in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2750.035s">And</a> at some point, they can tell you, this is the thing that's happening in my classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2757.637s">And</a> often they don't say anything with any particular regard to whether it was the same or not the same as some rule that they don't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2766.52s">But</a> my concern is when I hear about parents <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2771.415s">who</a> are hearing from their students that they're doing things that sort of explicitly different than what we've outlined for the community that erodes the trust that I think we really need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2784.423s">And</a> I just wanna make sure we're not knowingly doing things that keep kids out of school and erode trust in the work that we're doing because I know that you all are working around the clock to keep kids safe <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2799.606s">to</a> deal with the like, you know, all we heard about at the school committee conference was how dysregulated everybody is parents, you know, adults in the community, kids who have never felt dysregulation before in a significant way. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2812.735s">And</a> they're like, everyone is feeling this level of dysregulation and we can't fix that if the kids can't come to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2818.819s">So</a> I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make sure that those, that that can start to happen so that we can see that recovery <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2828.088s">start</a> to take hold, especially as vaccine rates rise.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4257.594s">Can</a> maybe we all talk about our comments before we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4263.398s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4263.718s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4264.939s">Mr.</a> Rousseau, did you have anything else?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4270.502s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4272.389s">So</a> I had a couple of things and I think, overall, they all speak to what my desire to have the outcomes listed the observable or measurable in some way so. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4288.052s">And</a> I think it's especially difficult when we talk about the school committee evaluating you, which is what this is for, about things that we really are not supposed to know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4299.655s">So</a> for example, how you evaluate your teachers is not, or what evaluations you issue to your teachers, like beyond what is in the contract, by law, we're really not supposed to be involved in those day-to-day operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4312.933s">However,</a> like those two things, you know, evaluating you is very connected to how you operate the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4321.177s">So</a> I think it would be helpful if we, if you just thought a little bit about the outcomes to make them a little bit more, I don't want to say tactical because I don't think it's a tactical thing, but a little bit more, <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4339.103s">like</a> actionable so that we can understand what those things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4343.465s">So</a> I can give you a couple of examples that jumped out at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4347.007s">When</a> we say improved SEL practices under the district improvement goal, <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4352.218s">To</a> me, when you say you're gonna improve something, you know what it is today, and then you see some change for the better in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4361.302s">And</a> if I were having to evaluate you on whether these practices improved, I don't know how to do that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4370.646s">But</a> I think you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4371.547s">I</a> just think it needs to be made more clear when we talk about outcomes, what you mean by that, so that we all can be evaluating you fairly when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4381.67s">A</a> couple of other places where I thought there was opportunity for that targeted feedback for teachers to improve practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4388.556s">I</a> think feedback is critically important to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4392.599s">And</a> the question becomes, how do we know you've provided feedback? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4398.024s">And</a> how do we all know that the feedback was <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4402.947s">like</a> internalized and put back into practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4406.569s">So</a> I don't, you know, again, I don't have an answer and I don't think you need to answer tonight how we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4411.291s">But</a> I think that's an important part of this conversation so that we can know then when it comes time to do your evaluation, this is what we said that would look like and it happened and we could see that and therefore this is how we feel about that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4427.138s">The</a> other place where I thought on the district improvement goal, two other suggestions that I had was with all of this map assessment happening, it's my impression that you will come back to us at multiple points in the year and tell us about the data at a subgroup level and that we sort of naturally would expect to see over the course of a school year that change over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4453.97s">So</a> the results change over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4456.424s">I</a> think that's a really actionable way for us to say, yes, we expected to see an improvement from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, and we were able to see it in the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4466.967s">I</a> don't know what that data looks like because we've never seen it before, but I think you do and your staff does. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4472.409s">So</a> if you can just think about like, what would that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4474.829s">What</a> would that thing be that would help us say that this investment <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4480.396s">in</a> map is helping us drive student you know drive the student outcomes in the overall district improvement, I think would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4487.283s">The</a> other thing that came to my mind as I listened. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4490.926s">on</a> this particular topic was a few years back, you provided a list of all the assessments being done across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4499.13s">And</a> it was a huge list. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4501.291s">I</a> remember just feeling sort of overwhelmed at the number of assessments in addition to MCAS that are happening across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4508.594s">Now</a> we've added MAP in a really intensive way for many, many grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4514.056s">A</a> rationalization of our overall assessment protocol would be a really actionable way to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4520.939s">we</a> have improved our practice here in the district around how we assess because I and I think you know one of the things that was striking about the MCAS presentation we just had was when you have a curriculum that works for you maybe you get to do less maybe you get the luxury of having to do less assessment to figure out where are you then then you did when you had a curriculum that didn't work for you so how do we take advantage of all of that and how do we really think about <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4550.71s">what</a> assessment is necessary in order to help give teachers the data that they need to do their work in the classroom without being a district that just does a different assessment flavor of the week constantly across time. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4566.676s">So</a> those are a couple of suggestions I had on the district improvement side. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4571.397s">On</a> the early literacy side, I think again, same kinds of comments, like what, when we talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4579.497s">analysis</a> of literacy outcome? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4581.359s">Are</a> we, you know, are we talking about some sort of like, percent of like progress that we've made? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4587.143s">Or</a> like, what is it that will help us understand that we're made that we are achieving the goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4594.129s">And</a> then the, you know, I think one of the things that's always been like, one of the more awesome things in my mind that that you all are doing now that did not used to happen in the district is the learning walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4605.699s">But</a> I don't think beyond <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4607.839s">knowing</a> that learning walks are happening or being able to attend one here or there, that we have the full appreciation for like the work you are doing to evaluate during the learning walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4618.661s">And</a> if there was a way for you to describe that, like, you know, I did learning walks at the beginning of the year and the end of the year, and this is what I saw that was different. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4628.383s">Those</a> would all be things that to me would make this outcome section much easier to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4635.905s">So</a> those are just my thoughts, but I think it's going to take you some time to figure out how to shift that around, which is why I wanted to wait.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4937.76s">Yes,</a> member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4939.761s">Yeah,</a> I think when I think that's really fair given that it's a new tool so what I would suggest that the outcome is twofold then to me in my mind, it is that we are going to spend this year creating a baseline, and that we would expect to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4959.0s">a</a> reasonable improvement in student performance from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, knowing that we don't know what that number can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4968.422s">And</a> we're also still in the middle of a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4971.523s">So</a> to say, like, I'm personally fine with there not being a number associated with it, but an overall expectation that we are going to see progress, I think is important to write down on paper so that we all know that that's what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4985.706s">And</a> again, totally fine with <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4989.648s">explicitly</a> stating that part of what we're doing this year is creating an actual baseline that we can then use as we go forward because that's a really important implementation step and if we skip that, we'll always be in this like, did we move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5004.92s">Did</a> we not? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5005.52s">Which</a> number are we operating against? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5008.242s">And</a> so I would like to avoid that if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5011.245s">So</a> doing those two things in terms of outcomes, I think makes it much more actionable for us to evaluate you at the end of the year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5036.969s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5037.33s">Is</a> that agreeable? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5038.27s">Motion</a> to table?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5040.611s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5515.076s">A</a> few years back now, the committee went through this process <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5521.065s">that</a> was the first time I had seen them do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5524.186s">It</a> actually predated me. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5525.387s">So</a> it's definitely a few years back that they outlined like over the course of five years, what were the projects and when did they think that they would happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5536.011s">And</a> what was the estimated cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5539.992s">And</a> then that document, I think the intention was that we might look at it on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5545.914s">And</a> we really haven't since. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5548.432s">for</a> lots of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5549.294s">So</a> I would like to see us do that again, maybe in January.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5597.025s">Yeah,</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5597.906s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5599.325s">From</a> a timing perspective, I would like to see us do this early enough in the year that it predates budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5608.253s">For</a> many reasons what you know, especially right now there's all these different funding sources in play that are not normally in play. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5618.041s">through</a> whether it's ARP or ESSER and they all have rules but I think it's also critically important for the mayor to have that information at her fingertips as she thinks about how the budget will support schools this year and all of the other priorities she has to balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5635.949s">So,</a> I just wanna make sure in this particular regard when we talk about capital funds, we're ahead of the budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5643.672s">I</a> wanna see us do the budget much sooner than we ever have before. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5648.019s">as</a> well. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5648.419s">But</a> I think in this regard, I think having that plan and committing to that on an annual basis will get us out of the habit of having to do the emergency things that we find ourselves doing because we have not, I think to the residents point earlier tonight, have not maintained our buildings the way they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5667.632s">So</a> this is to me a step in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5670.033s">The</a> other step being appropriating enough money to the maintenance budget that we can actually do those things proactively instead of <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5676.467s">costing</a> more money to react to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5678.168s">So</a> I would like to see us do this in January because then that clearly gets us out of the way of the budget season, I think.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6238.991s">I</a> would actually like to offer a friendly amendment that <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6245.235s">this</a> be referred to the communication engagement and strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6249.158s">I'm</a> a little taken aback to be honest with you that as the chair of the committee I didn't even know that this work started much less completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6257.805s">I'm</a> also shocked that they talked to parents because I don't ever remember hearing or seeing any <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6264.07s">thing</a> about how families might get involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6266.771s">And</a> I don't I think there's just still I have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6271.012s">I</a> think it's important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6272.893s">We</a> have a subcommittee for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6274.333s">So</a> I'd like to see us move this to the subcommittee where we can have a more in depth discussion about how this fits in with our strategic plan, among other things.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6440.612s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6441.333s">Is</a> there a deadline that we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6444.961s">respond</a> to Desi to participate this year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6712.941s">So</a> I guess maybe procedurally we need to lay this on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6718.302s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6718.903s">But</a> I think the more important thing is that there's too much to do and it also is past time for us to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6728.985s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6731.19s">The</a> pandemic made it plainly clear that we lack structures to communicate effectively in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6741.075s">And</a> I think we made a lot of progress, but those structures didn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6748.558s">So</a> we were like building the plane, flying the plane, repairing the plane, and trying to do it all perfectly, which is just like not even reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6758.062s">So</a> to remember McLaughlin's point, <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6761.305s">we</a> were in a worse position than we could have been had we had these structures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6766.128s">So</a> I think it's important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6768.91s">I</a> think it should go to the communication subcommittee rather than to be tabled so that we can have a more in-depth discussion about the time commitment, what our objectives are, do they line up, how does it match? <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6781.837s">So</a> I think we can do all of that and we can schedule a meeting next week to do it, which I'm fine with, to have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6791.143s">and</a> in the meanwhile, like we can get a an answer from Desi about like what the timeline is that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6797.127s">So,</a> I don't, I don't think we need to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6798.808s">I</a> think we just need to send it to the communication subcommittee and I'll get something scheduled.<h2><a href="../2021-10-05_hCz5uniVUiI/2021-10-05_hCz5uniVUiI.html">October 4, 2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2725.05s">I</a> actually maybe it's more of a statement, I would like to make sure that the principles are aware that we are expecting them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2732.893s">get</a> their numbers up from a participation perspective and asking, I'd like to ask that all the principals figure out what they need to do to reach their building communities and make that happen so that we are not seeing participation numbers this low. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2747.665s">I</a> feel like you can almost understand the kindergarten families coming in, not being used to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2753.99s">feeling</a> like they're a little bit lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2756.031s">And</a> we talked about that last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2757.872s">So</a> I assume some additional outreach is happening there, but every other student in Medford Public Schools has been through this rodeo for an entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2765.475s">So</a> I would, for the most part, with the exception of our remote students, but these percentages, they're not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2776.38s">And</a> I wanna make sure that the next time we see this report, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2780.062s">We</a> feel much much better like we did last year about the number of students participating because that is the only way we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2787.942s">rely</a> on our testing program to keep all of our students safe, to keep our staff safe, and to sort of make our way through this year without additional in-school spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2798.271s">So</a> I really think we need to focus on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2803.095s">There</a> are buildings whose numbers are exactly where I would sort of expect them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2807.879s">And</a> if they have tips and tricks, I would encourage others to reach out to those principals and find out what they're doing that's making <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2815.26s">making</a> them so successful, but I really do want to see these numbers back to where they were by the by the end of October, at a minimum, I mean it's been you know it's already been over a month that we've been in school, so I think we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2827.157s">We</a> need to focus on this as a community because it's the only way through this that I can see until such time as our vaccination rates go up dramatically and we're not seeing that happen yet either. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2840.948s">So</a> we really do need the principals to rise to the challenge here and make it happen.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5283.615s">Thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5285.516s">I</a> don't know if my question is necessarily for you or if it's for the administration, but I wanted to understand what... <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5292.933s">measures</a> and 360 evaluation is going to happen as this process rolls out so that we are sure that the administrators we're tasking to do this work are doing it with fidelity and they are doing it with the integrity that's intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5309.021s">So</a> how do we plan to evaluate our evaluators essentially through this process?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6018.643s">One</a> thing we may want to consider is to make a motion to ask the rules subcommittee to explicitly review that policy and create some guidance around the school committee email account specifically, because I think, you know, in this case like <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6036.838s">You</a> know, in my opinion that was a harmless question and I would like us to be able to answer it but that is in the eye of the beholder someone else may not find that harmless question at all, and may disagree but I think ultimately we've opened up this channel for people to communicate with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6053.097s">through</a> this email box, which frankly may or may not be the best way to get the answers to the questions that people send there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6060.9s">Like</a> there may be more effective ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6063.241s">So</a> I do think having some standards around what we do with stuff that comes to that box is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6073.626s">And</a> perhaps there are some rules and some guidelines that we can put in place to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6077.788s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that the role of <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6083.087s">the</a> school committee email box, which was like never a thing before COVID but is now be considered by the rules policy and equity subcommittee, and our public participation policies be amended accordingly, based on that review and any recommendation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6958.252s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6958.832s">So,</a> as you noted, the RFP process that we've been talking about is getting underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6968.279s">It</a> was delayed, and we are looking at ways to expedite that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6974.963s">However,</a> the playground needs to be able to be used tomorrow and the next day and the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=6981.107s">My</a> hope is that the committee will join me in asking for us to do an audit, a safety inspection of the playground right now so that we can identify anything that is critical and find a way to remediate it right now while we keep our eye on the RFP that needs to go out so that we can select a design vendor <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7002.662s">who</a> can engage the community about what that space really could or should be in a way that is, I think, more economical than the current design allows for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7012.724s">That</a> surface, I think for the public, when we went after grants for resurfacing all of the playgrounds at the elementary schools, that surface was like five times the cost of each other elementary school individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7029.487s">And</a> it's because it is such a large area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7033.534s">We</a> also have the good fortune of some local experts in playground design, who have been participating in the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7042.085s">and</a> really encouraging us to think about sort of the bigger picture, right, around accessibility and interest among students. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7051.347s">How</a> do you make a playground like that interesting for both elementary school and middle school students? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7055.248s">And</a> that's sort of why this design study was inserted into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7059.569s">So</a> unfortunately it was inserted into the process and then COVID took us in a, you know, obviously a very different direction, but I think the design study will, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7070.112s">pay</a> off in spades for the community and really produce something wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7076.494s">As</a> we go forward, but that doesn't mean that in the meantime, we can be okay with standing water and holes that somebody is going to sort of twist an ankle on or worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7086.598s">So</a> the safety inspection, I think, will allow us to do both things at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7091.662s">One</a> is make sure that playground is as safe as it can be while we acknowledge that it is at the end of its life and sort of move forward expeditiously on this RFP so that we can get that process moving.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7134.372s">Yeah,</a> and that will be part of the design study that happens is really grappling with that space, which does sit right next to the river, which is in a floodplain, as we talk about climate change going forward and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7149.726s">So</a> whoever is ultimately selected for the design study will have <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7155.13s">Really</a> a comprehensive order to look at the realities of the site, look at best practice and playground design which frankly, none of our other elementary schools are a best practice of playground design in 2021 they were when they were built many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7170.708s">but</a> we have an opportunity here to do something different and really bring that space, especially being sort of in the middle of the city where it is to a different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7182.157s">But</a> they also will have to grapple with climate change and what is going on in the ground and the drainage and all the other things that are the realities of that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7190.084s">So,</a> and we've also asked, we also will be asking that in that organization to <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7197.211s">significantly</a> engage the community so that the school community itself can be part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7203.974s">So</a> lots to come.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7218.406s">But</a> I think once it's presented, we can also make sure that the PTO gets a copy of the report so that it can be distributed amongst the families at the McGlynn as well, which I think would be really reasonable for us to be able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7235.072s">So</a> I would think that's a really easy thing for us to do to make sure that you all have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7241.315s">But</a> I don't know if there are other updates about the RFP timeline, Superintendent, or <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=7247.718s">And</a> if not, we can maybe talk about that at our next meeting so that we can keep track of that as well.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_Qaq6dcp8mcM/2025-06-26_Qaq6dcp8mcM.html">Community Development Board 09-22-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=229.379s">This</a> is Christy Dowd, I second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=235.723s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=237.304s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2915.197s">Hi,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2917.277s">So</a> I think just sort of extending a little bit of what Claes was saying, what I noticed is really the change in the base, and I think what's being lost in this new design is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2931.32s">pedestrian</a> activation at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2933.523s">I</a> understand that, you know, the amenity space has reduced in size with the overall reduction of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2940.071s">And</a> now it's more focused on the corner where it had extended up further on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2946.558s">And</a> now it appears to be <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2948.721s">being</a> replaced with just a mesh cover of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2953.662s">So</a> I just raise that as something that I think that makes it that base of the building now looks like it's a rear of the building and Boston Ave is a pretty important street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2968.467s">And</a> so if there's some consideration on how you treat that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2973.03s">Aesthetically,</a> as you advance this design, I would highly recommend that you look at that closer because it does look now like it's a back of building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2983.476s">And</a> I'm having a hard time understanding where the primary entrance of the building is in the updated plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2989.4s">It</a> was very clear in the last ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=2991.982s">Is</a> that the same entrance next to the amenity space?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=3283.288s">Yeah,</a> this is Christy got the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=3285.409s">That's</a> why I asked about the building main building entry because in the last <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=3290.736s">iteration,</a> it was very clear that there was a main entry right there with an awning, which made that portion of the facade, you know, look look more pedestrian friendly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10889.157s">May</a> I just make a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10890.437s">I</a> think it is in the public's interest that we approve more housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10895.019s">I</a> understand there are concerns and confliction with the size and the scale of what exists today, but we are moving forward to establish a new precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10909.464s">And</a> I think that they have done a tremendous job taking into account all of the comments that we provided <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10917.645s">at</a> the preliminary meeting to try to make it as compatible as possible to what exists there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10925.747s">But</a> we do have to recognize that this is a new path forward for this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10936.39s">So</a> I'm not as conflicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10943.292s">completely</a> in support of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qaq6dcp8mcM&t=10945.453s">And</a> I think we just have to think of, we still have to think forward and not so much of only what exists there today.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3546.556s">I</a> think my question was just whether the Board of Health had stats that they could provide us for the 12 plus population across the city, which is obviously bigger than our school population, but I am interested in what our 12 plus population looks like right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3562.306s">And</a> I don't know if the Board of Health has or can report on those numbers for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6183.676s">So,</a> just a confusion around what parents do when there is an issue and an overwhelming feeling that parents have been told over the years, I'm not saying by any of you that it's not our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6195.17s">So,</a> and to call the bus company and I just want to make sure that as we think about how we're directing families to communicate these issues like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6204.1s">I</a> don't personally see sending a bunch of individual parents to the bus company in a one-off fashion as really a way to systemically solve any problems, but I just wanted to raise that to your attention so that we could perhaps get some communication out from the principals about what to do if these things happen and make sure that the principals are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6225.791s">So</a> I just would ask that you all think about how to do that so that parents <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6230.893s">even</a> if they have in the past absolutely been told it's not our problem, that you all can set a better message for the community of consistency in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6241.359s">Dr.</a> Cushing?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6410.625s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6412.959s">I</a> do want to say I don't want any of the comments that we've been making about transportation to be construed as that certainly I don't think it has been a rocky transition to school I was actually so surprised when I did the tour last week with you how <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6430.649s">Much</a> of a very normal school day building, I entered into times three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6437.613s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6439.954s">I</a> do think I saw there was a district somewhere offering parents money to drive their own kid to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6447.578s">I</a> do not endorse that process, because I happen to be driving by Medford High School this morning and I thought to myself, do any students get to Medford High School on time because the backup, really in both directions was just stunning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6462.432s">So</a> less cars would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6464.533s">And</a> to that end, the other thing I was hoping that we could think about as we talk and work with Transfinder is whether, what the impact would be of changing that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6480.122s">two</a> mile radius to a mile and a half or one mile, what that would do for us as a community, what it would cost, what that impact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6491.168s">There</a> was, I had a discussion with some parents who in my mind, you know, I live near the high school, in my mind, they're way more than two miles away from me because it would <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6500.833s">take</a> me 20 minutes to get to their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6502.834s">And</a> in fact, they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6505.095s">In</a> fact, they're well within the two mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6507.877s">And</a> they are students who are either having to pay for bus passes or get transportation to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6515.561s">And</a> it just struck me especially this morning as I happened to be sitting at that stoplight and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6520.263s">every</a> stoplight between my house and Winthrop circle that these are all families, trying to get their kids to school they're all late at this point they're all very late, through no fault of probably their own because even I was sort of shocked at how long it took me to get out of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6537.105s">To</a> go where I was going this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6538.366s">So</a> if we can think about what that impact would be of bringing the radius in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6543.651s">I</a> think that could be really a productive conversation for us to have as a community for students for attendance for timeliness. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6553.62s">for</a> public transportation and all the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6555.862s">So</a> if we can think about that as Transfinder does their work, so we know strategically what our goals are and what our options are so that we can have a good productive conversation at budget time, rather than doing what we did with the bus contract last time, which was issue the same RFP we had always issued, say yes and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6575.2s">I</a> think that would be a meaningful step in the right direction.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6837.527s">I</a> will also be attending this year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7008.378s">I</a> went, somebody brought this to my attention I was like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7013.74s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7014.26s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7014.58s">There's</a> no left-handed desks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7016.101s">Even</a> we had left-handed desks when I was a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7019.122s">I</a> will also say that I hated left-handed desks as a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7021.943s">They</a> didn't particularly work for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7025.184s">Left-handed</a> folks tend to learn how to write in really creative ways because right-handed people teach us to write. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7033.006s">So</a> left-handed desks are great if you write with a hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7036.287s">In</a> your hand, if you don't write with a hook in your hand, you end up like this and your elbow is sort of wiggling all around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7042.39s">So</a> what I would say is, if we're going to purchase desks to meet this mandate please can we purchase desks that don't <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7050.787s">require</a> a handedness because those desks also don't work for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7054.629s">I</a> assume that right-handed desks also don't work for all right-handed people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7058.351s">I</a> just know that as a lefty my whole life, I always struggled with the resources provided to me in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7066.035s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_XbHZqgd1CkA/2025-06-26_XbHZqgd1CkA.html">Community Development Board 08-11-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7589.617s">Um,</a> yeah, so that's sort of leading to my second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7593.762s">Like</a> what is the give back to the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7596.646s">Um,</a> you know, just that I think there's an opportunity to do something better than a Starbucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7603.081s">at</a> the ground floor space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7605.902s">And</a> if that's commercial space, is there consideration for another gesture of give back to the neighborhood that promotes some sort of educational opportunity at the ground floor, something that promotes equity inclusion within that neighborhood or a neighborhood retailer? <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7628.613s">That's</a> just my concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7632.535s">I</a> think across greater Boston, you're seeing a lot of these life sciences buildings going up, and there is a huge focus on the ground floor commercial space to give back to the community in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7647.541s">And</a> my last comment is, I understand the phasing, but it does concern me that <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7654.335s">with</a> this being speculative, the garage being built first and having some sort of commitment to ensure that that's the building itself gets built, like then there's just not a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7667.32s">And</a> we've got a lot of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7668.38s">So</a> I don't know if there's any response to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7675.143s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=7675.703s">That's</a> all I have.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=13648.806s">And</a> this is Chrissy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=13650.347s">Do</a> you mind if I just make one more point just in terms of the, thank you, in terms of the commercial space on the ground floor when it comes to the neighborhood, I would encourage you to have more conversations with the abutters and the neighbors and make sure that it's something that people also want there and they, you know, would like to have in the neighborhood.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=13792.587s">Anyone</a> want to second the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=13795.146s">This</a> is Kristi Dowd, I'll second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15782.854s">Sorry,</a> I'm just reading the summary again.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15895.746s">So</a> I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15896.706s">I</a> mean, what's the burden to the developer for giving National Grid the easement? <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15903.645s">You</a> know a burden on now the property and does it lower the value does it impact the owners of the parcels now I mean I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15914.659s">I</a> get it there's some logistics around it but I guess if. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15918.984s">I'm</a> just trying to sway myself one way or another by just gathering a little more facts like if it's not a safety issue and it's more of an aesthetic and I understand the board approved it before to be underground, you know, that's one thing but if it's not a safety issue to have it overhead. <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15935.332s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=15940.105s">Does,</a> does the developer just not want to take the time to do it because you know we're sort of like at this home stretch or is it a burden and impact to the, to the value of the land to provide national grid with an easement.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jBTv0vMcUC8&t=16925.737s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=931.534s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=933.635s">To</a> that point, Dr. Edward Benson, I just want to also point out that as a leader, you acquire a staff, and then you have to sort of assess the staff as they are and think about how to move forward as the organization shifts and evolves. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=951.18s">And</a> I think one of the things that you've done remarkably well is bring the right people onto the bus with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=957.942s">I've</a> been so impressed with the work that you've done as you've hired new folks into the district to really be a compliment to the team and the strengths that already exist, and really to find those folks who are as invested in moving Medford forward as you are so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=976.589s">decision</a> making is often one of the most complex things you do as a leader and one of the most impactful but I think you are doing an exceptional job as you decide and recommend us who those folks are and make hiring decisions really all throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=995.849s">So</a> I want to say thank you for that and certainly you know as you <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1000.278s">review</a> somebody, it's very, it's sort of counterintuitive to reflect the work of others into somebody's review, but that is often something that, you know, you look at leaders as the sort of sum of the parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1014.603s">And,</a> you know, when I think about the strategic plan and even just the dramatic shift in the strategic plan in one short year, it's really been very remarkable to watch you all work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1026.487s">So</a> thank you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3347.969s">Does</a> the motion include both the budget recommendation as outlined and the ESSER funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3356.672s">Are</a> we taking one vote on both?<h2><a href="../2021-06-14_JcaRW85lvs0/2021-06-14_JcaRW85lvs0.html">Committee of the Whole Meeting - Superintendent's Evaluation</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=714.465s">Thank</a> you for all your hard work, it's pretty interesting to reflect back over less than 12 months and think about how much has been accomplished not just pandemic oriented but really well beyond the pandemic, and how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=733.677s">Notable</a> change, there is a foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=736.639s">So</a> when I think about the presentations we received from your, your leadership team and the <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=746.81s">commentary</a> and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=748.552s">It's</a> notable that things are moving forward and changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=751.797s">And</a> so that's way more than you can ask for in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=755.982s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=757.344s">And</a> then I did have a question about procedurally for the school committee in terms of how we <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=765.775s">will</a> formalize our feedback to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=769.538s">I</a> think member Rousseau offered to collect all that feedback earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=774.042s">And</a> I just wanted to establish what that timeline would be since this is our last scheduled meeting so that we can make sure that we complete this this year and get to go into next year sort of as it's intended instead of as we have been forced to do for these last couple of years.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1041.808s">I</a> thought that voice votes are not allowed until tomorrow under the <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1046.223s">emergency</a> provisions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1170.007s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1171.108s">Member</a> Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1172.609s">So</a> I guess two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1173.83s">One</a> is just looking for clarification about whether <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1180.163s">whether</a> meetings must be held in person at that time, because that obviously changes scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1189.985s">And</a> then my other question is, the city council can approve or decline the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1198.846s">They</a> can't change the amount, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1216.83s">So</a> we could meet in anticipation that nothing will change next week in a special meeting and then call a separate meeting if it becomes necessary after they vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1230.676s">Is</a> that another potential option?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12482.014s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12482.967s">I</a> also wanted to thank the Advisory Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12485.728s">I</a> think anytime you sign on for a volunteer gig, it always is more than we promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12494.771s">And</a> this is no exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12496.652s">I</a> know that members of the Advisory Committee worked hard in meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12500.853s">I</a> watched them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12502.554s">I</a> know they worked hard outside of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12504.535s">And</a> I know they worked hard to find a way forward, even though they, at times, intensely disagree with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12511.944s">I</a> think that is the true spirit of public discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12515.285s">And</a> I appreciate and thank you all for your actions and for the grace that you and compassion that you showed as you put this together and came before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12527.208s">I</a> will say one of the things that has been the most striking to me throughout this process is the letter that we received from a good number of the teachers at the Columbus School, citing their favor to Missituk, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12540.86s">And,</a> you know, one of the things that they talked about was in fact moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12546.204s">I</a> think the letter may have acknowledged that there were some number of teachers, which I think is really reasonable to expect that didn't want to change the name at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12555.371s">And</a> as educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12557.119s">And</a> as the folks, the adults in the room that we expect to take care of and protect the students who go to school there, I really appreciated their thoughtfulness and the way that they sat back and reflected beyond sort of what they might have individually thought and said, what is the best thing for our school community? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12578.795s">And</a> what do we think is the best thing for the children who go here? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12581.557s">So</a> I am in favor of Missituk.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12641.709s">I</a> do believe that before, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12645.461s">we</a> are done voting, we have to make a motion for a name and then vote for that name. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12652.904s">So,</a> you know, we can straw poll, I think that's great and fine, but at some point, I think we will have to take an actual vote to rename the school to something specific, just to make sure that we are adhering to the rules of order.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12678.646s">Missituk.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12765.604s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13561.979s">Mayor,</a> actually, I think one of the things we spent a fair bit of time talking about was sort of this contention of like, how do we strike a balance between not asking our administrators to be here at midnight and <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13574.83s">respecting</a> the valuable role the public plays in providing input so one of the things that we did in the redesign of the agenda was move all of the school committee business to the front of the agenda so that that part of the agenda can start earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13592.084s">We</a> can continue to do executive session ahead of time if necessary we can do all of that business with a commitment to the public <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13599.029s">that</a> we won't begin public comment or any new business resolutions from the school committee until 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13607.033s">So</a> that way we don't have to wait to start a meeting until 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13610.975s">We</a> can get moving with the things on our agenda that we must do as a committee by law and statute like approve the minutes, approve the bills, all of those things <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13620.495s">receive</a> the report of the superintendent, but that also we acknowledge and respect the fact that turning out at a meeting at five o'clock is not easy for some people and having an option for them to be able to participate with us starting at seven is much more palatable and traditional. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13638.294s">we</a> sort of bifurcated the agenda, uh, intentionally so that, you know, we could end up in a situation where all of our business is done at six 30, and then we just will recess till seven for the public to know that on, you know, religiously, we will not start before 7pm, um, and trying to sort of respect all of those things in balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13660.207s">So</a> I think that's, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13662.737s">work</a> that we did really thoughtfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13664.278s">We</a> had nice input from the public on that, and I really do think it's worth a try, particularly as we make all of these transitions in our meetings going forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13929.754s">I</a> came up in a subcommittee meeting and we actually talked about the city of Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13934.236s">So</a> Cambridge does not start school earlier than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13938.158s">I</a> believe that they don't observe the Lunar New Year as a no school day, but the other two are observed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13946.282s">days</a> off from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13948.484s">And</a> on the whole, they don't really appear to get out any later than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13954.269s">And</a> I think really, if you look at like next year, I think none of these three days actually fall on a Monday to Friday in a calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13963.677s">And</a> they're not like observances, like we observe <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13968.58s">Like</a> we observe Christmas on a day that's not a weekend if Christmas falls on a Saturday, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13974.967s">So</a> that is not what the proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13977.609s">The</a> proposal is to observe these religious holidays, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13980.759s">that</a> are really meaningful to a portion of our community on the days in which they observe them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13986.163s">If</a> they happen to fall Monday to Friday during our 180 day school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13991.306s">I</a> believe next year, one of them is on a Saturday, one of them is in July and one of them is on April vacation or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13999.391s">So,</a> and as member Ruseau said, there's not a year for about five years before there's really <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14007.456s">any</a> significant sort of shifting of the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14010.698s">And</a> I think, you know, when I thought about this, I want my kids out of school as soon as possible this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14018.402s">And</a> usually I'm sort of there every year myself, but I also tried to think about like, what would happen if somebody tried to take away Christmas from my kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14029.867s">And</a> that is how we, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14032.748s">observe</a> or don't observe holidays for another portion of our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14035.891s">I</a> think that's important to note. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14038.813s">I</a> also think you know when we talk about how hot the schools are we have to deal with that problem because that problem exists it's real and it's not going away in 2 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14051.465s">give</a> or take is really not going to change very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14055.267s">As</a> I thought about how do we compromise about this, I thought it would be wildly unpalatable for the community to talk about taking away holidays that already are on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14067.955s">Instead</a> of that, I thought it might make sense to try this, not next year, but starting the following year to respect the community's <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14077.93s">in</a> our population that really go without right now when it comes to observance of their holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14085.211s">And</a> I think like anything, we can try it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14089.052s">We</a> can figure out what works about it and what doesn't, and we can revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14093.353s">It's</a> not set in stone, but there are other communities doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14098.194s">We</a> are not alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14101.374s">And</a> I would be happy to be on the leading edge of this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14133.321s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14458.632s">And</a> I think there were members of the Muslim community in particular who expressed that during the meeting that, you know, the folks who came to the meeting were so appreciative of our consideration that, you know, they acknowledged like this does at some point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14476.501s">At</a> some point we will break the calendar and we will have to figure out what we do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14480.403s">And</a> they, you know, they just were so willing to have that conversation and be part of the dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14489.278s">you</a> know, frankly, and in a way that's much more gracious than really we deserve because we've not observed their holidays for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14497.641s">So</a> it was nice to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14499.741s">Um,</a> and I think when the time comes for that to discussion to happen, um, we'll want to have it with the right stakeholders in the room, um, and come up with the right answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14511.905s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14512.225s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16251.184s">Through</a> the chair I think the point of this is to provide some flexibility and some consistency at the same time so the public is particularly interested we're introducing new resolutions where we are deliberating debating and setting policy and all of that would certainly be happening consistently 7 o'clock or later. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16274.254s">The</a> things that are moving up front are the <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16278.206s">the</a> things that we do and approve and the public rarely participates although they're welcome to everything is recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16288.014s">And</a> I just feel like this is worth a try. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16292.437s">I</a> think we have to also acknowledge that the administrators are right here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16299.863s">There</a> are employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16302.205s">It's</a> an employee's market right now and <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16305.091s">we</a> need to be respectful of their time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16308.934s">And</a> so to me, this is a nice compromise between the public who may want to join us on a given night and the administrators who are required to join us every single night. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16323.446s">And</a> I think we should try it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16325.068s">So</a> I make a motion to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16660.129s">Subcommittee</a> said the meeting can start at different times based on what's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16665.97s">If</a> there's one thing on the agenda, maybe it starts at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16668.51s">If</a> there's 12 things on the agenda, maybe it starts at 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16671.251s">If</a> we have executive session, maybe it starts at 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16675.132s">With</a> the goal being we're not introducing new business or talking about resolutions until 7 o'clock when people can be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16682.093s">But</a> the start time of the meeting can shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16685.353s">It's</a> the whole reason why we pushed all of this stuff to the front of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16690.006s">so</a> that we are covering those things that generally have much less participation, that have to get done to the front so that we can both hear from the community at 7 and start the meeting early so that we can get out of here before midnight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16995.396s">Motion</a> to approve?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17003.14s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=54.861s">Hi,</a> everyone.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=230.013s">I</a> think you read this first and then do attendance.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=630.063s">I</a> see Dr. Cushing has his hand in the air, so I'll have to defer to him.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=657.207s">And</a> Dr. Cushing, we currently scheduled for seven, is that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=930.622s">And</a> remember, so I would like to hear if there's anyone who has joined us who has thoughts about these particular holidays.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1215.124s">Yeah,</a> so I was actually trying to look at the calendar as we were talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1220.066s">And</a> for example, for the 2022-2023 school year, these holidays all occur in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1223.347s">The</a> Lunar New Year is on a Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1234.518s">one</a> of the holidays is I believe on 4-21. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1238.339s">But</a> I, hold on a second, did I do that wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1247.223s">On</a> 4-21, which if I am like eyeballing that correctly would fall within April vacation often. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1256.746s">So</a> that's right around that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1258.346s">And</a> then the final one is on <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1260.08s">Wednesday,</a> June 28th, which could actually sort of be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1264.363s">So</a> I think, you know, one thing we could consider is adding these holidays and, you know, amending the policy to say that, you know, when the superintendent presents the calendar in November of every year, we need to look with, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1286.313s">know,</a> we need to look at the impact of the full schedule and determine whether we have a contention issue with snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1296.12s">And</a> I think the other sort of thing that I'm thinking about is wanting to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1305.883s">know</a> if there are other districts out there that are using holidays like this in a flexible manner for staff where we might be able to provide time for students in a unilateral way but provide <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1323.842s">flexible</a> professional development for staff with the thought that like the same staff member is likely not going to observe Good Friday and Yom Kippur, for example, or Good Friday and Rosh Hashanah, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1340.328s">So</a> there might be, you know, there just might be some other creative options, which I don't think we can necessarily like get to the bottom of in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1349.012s">And</a> they obviously have like <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1351.157s">impacts</a> across our ecosystem, but maybe there are other creative ways to think about some of that stuff if we can get some feedback from the group that's here and perhaps from our colleagues on Monday night around the directional way we might go and <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1376.798s">present</a> some questions to the administration to sort of come back to us with in September, because again, we're not enacting this, this set of changes would not take effect for an entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1386.768s">So</a> we could, you know, talk about draft changes and what the challenges are, what the opportunities are with those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1399.792s">in</a> terms of recognizing holidays that are really important to members of our community and then pose a series of questions to the administration for a little bit of like digging and research on their end around some other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1411.457s">That's</a> something that I've been thinking about as we've been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1416.779s">And</a> I just, I think the other thing that's like really top of mind for me at the moment is <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1424.105s">just</a> how hot it's been in this last week, and that's not going to be getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1429.59s">So</a> as we are adding holidays, we are making decisions to extend the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1436.036s">And</a> in an extreme weather year, we could be right up to the end of June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1443.423s">And</a> so maybe that is worthy of discussion in its own right to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1448.989s">We</a> didn't talk about or revisit any of the things that we have always done, and maybe we could or we should as a part of this discussion in a larger way at the beginning of the next school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1703.839s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you to Horia as well for pointing us to Cambridge Public Schools because they might be a useful model for us to talk to as well about how they <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1716.28s">are</a> managing all of this inside of their calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1719.162s">So</a> thank you for pointing us in the right direction instead of having us sort of have to cast a wide net of our school committee colleagues across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1728.067s">So</a> we can check in with them for sure.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2139.833s">And</a> Horia, I think one of the things that is definitely true starting next year is that <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2149.012s">there</a> will be no testing allowed on your holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2153.054s">So</a> hopefully this year being the mess that it has been for lots of reasons, was an anomaly and that at minimum next year, we will have clear guidance about tests and projects and homework in place while we figure out how to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2173.404s">be</a> equally respectful of all of the religious holidays that the folks in Medford celebrate, you know, whoever they might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2183.452s">So</a> even if this is sort of tricky and complicated and maybe gonna take some time, I feel better that we have put some things in place to make some significant <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2198.29s">clarifying</a> moves for next year, but even though we may just need to keep working at this for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2207.554s">So</a> I hope that there's a way for us as we go into next year and the superintendent continues her communications that when the holidays come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2221.183s">that</a> are sort of in this block mode where there is school, but there are restrictions on what can happen in school that we can find a good proactive way to reach families in their native language so that they know what is expected or not expected and what choices and options they have, as you point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2246.393s">So</a> I think that will be really important next year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2308.862s">I</a> think the only thing we need to add is the minimum of 180 school days and 185 scheduled days, just so it's clear that we have to schedule 185 days.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2538.752s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2543.576s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2789.527s">Yeah,</a> I was just thinking that it might actually be helpful to call that a third thing, which is, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2799.188s">like</a> presentation from the public so that when we're talking on the agenda, when we're talking about presentation from the public, we are only covering that if there is a presentation that has followed this procedure, it has gone to the superintendent and is noted on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2815.923s">Otherwise,</a> there's nothing in that section and we're moving on and there can be no, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2820.987s">confusion</a> between somebody who has scheduled time to do a presentation on dyslexia, for example, which was one of our most recent, and somebody who wants to talk about dyslexia, but is not on that section of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2837.235s">So</a> I sort of feel like that should be its own section of the agenda, just to be really clear about what it is, and more importantly, what it is not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2863.563s">No,</a> I think it's fine just the way you have it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3106.751s">No,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3107.391s">I</a> was just shaking my head and agreeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3109.492s">I</a> actually really liked this change and was going to suggest something similar, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3115.376s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3370.367s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3373.261s">I</a> guess, um, you know, one thing we could consider is say to move us towards this goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3377.987s">We</a> acknowledge that all residents have the same rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3382.833s">And</a> and then, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3385.819s">and</a> ask that during public participation, participants remain respectful and constructive or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3397.15s">So</a> it sort of points to like, we're trying to do this and we need your help to maintain that during this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3405.517s">And</a> then, you know, the residency piece like, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3411.578s">comes</a> out like as a stated thing, which I think is fine if, you know, cause I don't think that's the only way that public participation can feel very unwelcoming for some. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3423.485s">So</a> I think if we try to say, we're trying to make this portion of our agenda welcoming and a place where we can, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3436.775s">hear</a> constructively from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3440.077s">I</a> feel like that's really the goal we're trying to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3443.379s">So</a> perhaps that is a way to solve this and be inclusive.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3914.764s">Need</a> a motion to approve?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3920.206s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=3923.748s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4249.729s">I,</a> so I guess I think, you know, certainly the, there has to be enough substance that anybody could understand what we're talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4259.579s">And</a> sometimes that's not the case until a presentation has been delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4265.104s">So</a> certainly I would expect that a presentation or what have you be delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4272.915s">first</a> or a description of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4277.04s">But</a> I do like hearing from the public first. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4283.158s">Because</a> I think it gives the public an opportunity to provide us their thoughts in a constructive way without being influenced by what we have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4291.403s">And</a> to allow us to sort of like reflect on that before we dive in and start asking our questions, which may, you know, sometimes there's probably overlap so <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4303.952s">But</a> I also think when I tend to agree with you that when public comment happens before, during, and after the committee also asking questions, what gets, I think, really confusing is that <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4321.404s">We</a> are not supposed to be addressing the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4323.967s">It</a> is not a conversation, you know, that we're having under Robert's rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4329.352s">So</a> I do think being clear about like, are we taking public comment and then we're talking or vice versa could go a long way to. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4340.203s">frankly</a> making our meetings feel more constructive because I think at times that tension of, I've just said something and I'm expecting you to respond and we're not, that's really not what's supposed to be happening is really dissatisfying for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4355.873s">And</a> this could help, I think this could help if we were certainly clear one way or the other, but I would tend to want to hear from the public before we provide our comments and questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=4702.121s">I</a> did wonder if any members of the public had thoughts about this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6322.356s">In</a> the spirit of not making the public wait till the end to comment, can we hear from Eunice who has had her hand in the air?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6933.949s">So</a> I had a couple of thoughts and sort of simultaneous with all of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6941.111s">We</a> are being asked by the public to meet much, much later than we have been meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6945.772s">And</a> I understand why the public would want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6951.393s">But</a> again, that puts sort of stress and pressure on our employees when the lion's share of the meeting is often being covered by, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6962.314s">the</a> employees of the district and handling all of this mandatory work. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6967.336s">So</a> I feel like I am coming around to the notion that we would start early, we would cover all, we would cover our executive sessions first, which I actually think is prudent, given that those conversations are highly sensitive and having them at 10 or 11 o'clock at night is never <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6991.38s">going</a> to be our best work as the superintendent mentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=6995.344s">We</a> then do all of the superintendent's reports and we make a commitment to the public that the public presentations and new business will not start before 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7008.72s">We</a> then allow public presentations, if there are any, that have been requested in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7015.667s">Then</a> we talk about our new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7017.449s">And</a> before new business, the chair of the school committee, whether that's the mayor or somebody standing in, the vice chair, talks about, for each new business item, we're going to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7033.068s">who</a> has submitted the new business is going to provide their description on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7038.732s">We</a> are gonna ask if there's members of the public that need to speak, then we will deliberate and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7044.857s">And</a> that way we can continue starting our meetings earlier, which I feel like is good for everybody, but that we make a commitment that the public, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7060.554s">participation</a> part in any resolutions being entered by the school committee, which are really like our new business, or really the full of the agenda of the city council will not start until 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7071.163s">And</a> that way we have an option.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7080.751s">I'm</a> referring to presentations of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7083.974s">So</a> number three moves down, and new business comes after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7090.618s">so</a> that we're doing a little, we're sort of trying to satisfy a lot of different interests at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7104.35s">But</a> I think, you know, we have to, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7108.257s">You</a> know, we have to acknowledge that if we, if we allow the superintendent's report to go first, the members of her staff that are there to present on one item then have an option to go home and they might actually be able to get home before seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7126.255s">And</a> that the policy making part of our job, which is really what effectively new business is right and is like most aligned with the city council that starts at seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7137.54s">So</a> that or no earlier than seven, so that the public knows when they can show up and participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7146.463s">I'm</a> making a presumption that people can continue to hear from the superintendent remotely and via Zoom, and that that option will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7156.53s">But</a> I think that could allow us to meet earlier, but be clear about where the public participation component is, and maybe aim at slightly more efficient meetings than we've been able to have in the past.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7196.41s">up</a> above the report of the superintendent because to me, like basically what we had talked about in the last meeting was putting all of our stuff at the back so that we weren't keeping the public all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7206.613s">But</a> what I'm suggesting is the meetings start earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7209.414s">So</a> we push all that stuff back to the front so that seven o'clock becomes like sort of a reasonable time to think that we would be getting to the more public oriented components. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7222.417s">And</a> then, correct, and then new business would come after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7230.302s">So,</a> yeah, so new business would be number six.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7236.826s">And</a> I would put it right above pursuant to the policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7277.485s">And</a> I think there should just be something really clear that says this section of the agenda will not begin before 7 p.m.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7295.177s">And</a> then the consent agenda would also go up to the top.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7325.899s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7720.257s">Can</a> I just do a time check? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7721.898s">I</a> think the superintendent is in the middle of a number of actual district things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7729.62s">So</a> it is almost 10 past six, and I do think this is worth a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7739.222s">I</a> think this is worth a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7740.742s">I</a> think what this does is it lays out two clear paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7743.983s">One,</a> if you wanna say something to us, you can ask the superintendent to put you on the agenda 48 hours in advance or whatever the timeframe is that's listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7754.585s">That's</a> one option. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7756.566s">Or</a> you can be prepared to speak on any of the new business items that are on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7766.041s">those,</a> there are two options, two ways to speak to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7771.405s">One,</a> in the like, I wanna talk about something I wanna talk about, you just have to coordinate that in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7777.95s">And</a> the other, as it relates to something that we're deliberating on in the new business or continued business section, at each, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7787.127s">point</a> in the agenda where we are covering that, the chair will ask, is there anyone in the audience who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7793.889s">And</a> then we can hear from them, we can proceed to deliberate, and then we can vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7798.431s">So</a> I think there are two clear options. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7802.152s">One</a> is in response to an item on the agenda, and one is, I don't wanna respond to an agenda item, I would like to say something else entirely, and that goes through the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7814.377s">We</a> also are able to start our meetings earlier because of the structure and format of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7818.901s">It's</a> now quite clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7822.203s">And</a> the public knows that we are not gonna take up business in terms of policy and new resolutions before 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7830.81s">that</a> they may want to weigh in about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7835.474s">So</a> with that, I make a motion to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7862.873s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=7864.954s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2694.43s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2695.93s">We</a> met on the 25th for about an hour and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2699.411s">And</a> the subject of the meeting was really to go through the draft of the strategic plan, which we all saw last February. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2706.512s">And</a> it has been substantially updated since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2708.973s">So</a> we went through it in quite a bit of detail and I don't want to steal the superintendent's thunder since she will be presenting <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2718.038s">in</a> more detail later on in this meeting, but a couple of things that we did talk about explicitly was really around this being a starting point and important for us to as a committee endorse and sign off on so that we can start to move forward and take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2735.223s">We</a> did also talk about the fact that come the fall, we'll be working on ways to <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2742.323s">bring</a> the community to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2744.384s">So</a> we need to sort of start moving, but we also need to recognize that this is just the start of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2751.566s">It's</a> a living document and a sizable objective for this upcoming school year would be around seeking family, true family and authentic family engagement in the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2764.641s">and</a> specifically in the mission and vision, which we did talk about in our roundtables earlier this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2771.766s">But</a> in the spirit of doing those things well instead of quickly, we were in agreement that those things should happen in the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2781.583s">We</a> also talked about making sure that as we continue through this process that some of the task forces that we've set up, including the racial equity task force, weigh in and provide some specific and explicit feedback about some of the items in the strategic plan and really highlight for us if there are places where they feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2802.769s">the</a> plan as it is stated, or as we set out, should be adjusted based on their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2809.652s">And</a> the superintendent shared some comments about that committee in terms of their work getting started, but being significantly impacted by the pandemic, the ability to meet, the really unusual nature of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2821.956s">And</a> so there's more to come, I think, from them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2825.238s">but</a> we did explicitly ask that they weigh in as it relates to the strategic plan and how their recommendations will fit in. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2835.125s">So,</a> and I don't wanna steal the superintendent center because she'll be presenting later today, but I hope at that time you all will think as highly of the plan as we did in subcommittee and move to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2848.574s">So</a> I think we just need to approve the minutes at the moment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2856.215s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8573.385s">I</a> just want to point out for the listening audience that all of this work was a tremendous amount of effort and it happened <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8581.774s">while</a> we were fixing many years of deferred maintenance, while we were getting kids back to school, while we were building a best in state testing program, while we were keeping kids in school and not sick.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=1930.59s">Not</a> in the 68.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=1931.131s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=1932.572s">And</a> when will we be talking about the capital budget?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=372.889s">And</a> before you start, Dr. Edward-Vinson, I think what you and I talked about is that this would be an opportunity for us to dive back in in a level of detail that hasn't previously been shared with the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=389.353s">And</a> have this group really think about what we're seeing and hearing, as well as what we heard from all the roundtables that this group worked to get off the ground earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=404.106s">I</a> guess that was just a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=406.948s">and</a> just allow us to start to think about the best positioning of this as it goes forward, not just with the school committee, but also the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=418.671s">So</a> I think at the end of this, after our questions, I'd like to make sure we just have a little bit of time to talk about those next steps as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=427.053s">But</a> I think other than that, the floor is yours.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=878.367s">I</a> don't think I can make a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=880.067s">I</a> can only see the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=886.029s">It</a> must be because I'm a host or something.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=3973.775s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4373.634s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4374.915s">Thanks,</a> Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4377.035s">Superintendent,</a> the other sort of thing that struck me as I was listening to all of this, I have some specific questions, which I think are honestly less important. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4391.758s">But</a> one of the things that I think is a huge opportunity to include in this plan is to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4400.379s">how</a> you will include the community as you unfold this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4404.945s">So,</a> you know, we had these, I thought, really great discussions about our mission and vision statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4411.773s">And</a> I think, I'll be honest, I've never liked them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4415.497s">I</a> think somebody 20 years ago wrote them and nobody has thought they were <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4420.664s">important</a> enough to like revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4423.566s">But</a> I think we heard so much great feedback when we asked the community what they thought about our mission and vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4430.472s">And</a> my takeaway from that was, if we try to like do that right now, we will do it badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4438.439s">And</a> so I didn't really want to sort of push to make that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4443.884s">But</a> I would like to see <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4446.806s">us</a> commit as part of our strategic plan to doing that work next year that like we we have this like opinion that we want that this is a like a starting point and that there's a lot of work that has to be done you know that has to be done that the school committee needs to approve but as you were all talking I sort of had in my mind the notion of like some sort of like state of the school district address <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4476.403s">That</a> would provide an update on this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4479.427s">And</a> I, you know, as I was thinking about some of the things that like, you know, I would word differently or that I feel like the like the meanings there, but it's like the, the. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4492.438s">Text</a> is like the message is like the text and the words are like really heavy and they're sort of a mouthful. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4499.381s">Like</a> that sort of finessing to me doesn't need to be done to say, yes, we agree with like where this is going and we need to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4507.944s">But</a> I do think it would pay off in spades to think about collaboration in particular, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4517.788s">to</a> start with this plan and to say, how do we intend to collaborate with the community around us to take this plan through its first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4530.473s">We're</a> going to redo the mission and vision, and we are going to ask for feedback and reactions to <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4540.578s">the</a> words and statements that we use, not to necessarily change the meaning, but to like crisp it up, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4547.004s">And</a> I think if you look at how you draft something, it starts out with like the full thought of what you're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4555.693s">And</a> then the more people look at it, you sort of refine, refine, refine, refine, refine to get to something that's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4561.732s">powerful</a> and compelling and I think there's still opportunity to do that in all the work that you've done without derailing the work that is ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4570.494s">So,</a> I would like to see some explicit commitment to that kind of collaboration with the community over the next year that frankly takes this document from <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4586.932s">Like</a> a requirement of your induction as a superintendent to being like a real grounding source, not just for you and your staff, but for the entire community and the community just hasn't been able to participate in this at all just yet, and that doesn't mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4606.363s">You,</a> you can't get the agreement of the school committee and do the work, you know, begin doing the work but I do think we need to think through some of those things and make them explicit parts of the plan so that it's clear that we're not we're not looking for all of that work to be buttoned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4624.617s">you</a> know, this year in June so that you all can start, but instead to say, like, part of the work ahead of us is to take this document to, like, its next iteration or its next life, whatever that might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4636.962s">So</a> I think there is opportunity, and I think it all fits nicely in the, like, spirit of collaboration and partnership as, you know, as, like, an anticipated outcome of this plan and a set of action steps in its own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4652.609s">So</a> I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4655.407s">maintaining</a> this plan has to be part of the plan and I think like on the academic side I have no questions that that will happen but on the like there being a grounding document that people come back to and say yes this is still our plan for the next five years or six years or whatever I think that's going to take its own kind of commitment and I want to make sure that we're talking about that when we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4679.785s">You</a> know, approving this plan is not because we think it's like the perfect be all end all plan it's because we believe that this is the right direction and part of that direction is really about. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4694.969s">endeavoring</a> to get to version two of the plan, right, as one of many objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4700.353s">So</a> I had a lot of like, I had a lot of thoughts as you all were going through about like verbiage and language and those kinds of things, which, you know, I think I have like one set of opinions about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4713.883s">I</a> think if you talk, if you like had a task force of people, they'd all have opinions about that and sort of out of that would come something. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4720.608s">really</a> amazing, particularly if you engaged a bunch of non-educators in terms of how do we speak in a compelling way to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4731.337s">You</a> might see something slightly different even though the work doesn't change at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4736.541s">I</a> had a lot of thoughts around that and instead of trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4742.168s">talk</a> about like where we could change words like that just seemed like it just seemed like we were like we would only nibble around the edges right now if we got into like a wordsmithing exercise of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4755.074s">So</a> that wasn't like I don't want that to become like the thing that this subcommittee does or even that the school committee at large does because I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4764.295s">like</a> nibbling around those edges is gonna get us sort of any further ahead than what the document as it basically stands has. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4771.677s">But</a> that commitment to that like next step and that version two, I think could be really powerful in many regards. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4780.279s">And</a> certainly be another signal to the community that we actually do value the input and the feedback that parents give, which is a C level change <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4793.843s">for</a> this district, like in the minds of parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=4796.504s">So</a> being able to demonstrate that I think would be hugely powerful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5345.6s">Yeah,</a> so I mean, I think this we as a subcommittee can vote to ask you to present this to the larger school committee at an upcoming meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5354.723s">I</a> would love for it not to be the meeting on the seventh because I think there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5361.105s">really</a> full agenda there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5365.03s">So</a> I guess that leaves the 14th, but we can certainly take that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5370.256s">The</a> only other question that I had that I did want to mention to this group was, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5376.583s">We</a> haven't heard much from the Racial Equity Task Force as a committee yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5383.346s">And</a> I did hear you mention an equity audit in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5386.587s">I</a> don't remember seeing that in the budget particularly or in a called out way. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5391.649s">But</a> I am completely on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5393.81s">But</a> one of the things I would like to ask the Racial Equity Task Force to really explicitly weigh in on is, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5401.373s">When</a> we talk about the PALS curriculum and our collaboration with law enforcement, I would really like to hear from the Racial Equity Task Force about those concepts and their either support or non-support of those activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5421.287s">I</a> think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5423.408s">The</a> police in schools is a very hot topic right now, and has been for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5429.75s">And,</a> you know, frankly for much longer but certainly schools taking active and drastic measure over what they've ever done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5442.405s">to</a> act, especially since the death of George Floyd one year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5450.791s">And</a> I would like to hear from the Racial Equity Task Force about where they are at in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5461.938s">the</a> role of police in our own schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5464.74s">So,</a> and I know that is a hot topic and it will be the source of much conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5471.564s">And</a> I'm not even suggesting that we do that this school year, but I would like to hear from them at some point as they do their work in terms of what explicitly they've considered in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5483.09s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5788.231s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5788.931s">So</a> is there a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5793.846s">bring</a> this to the full school committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5798.067s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5800.088s">All</a> right, motion to bring this report to the full school committee by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5806.389s">So</a> I'll do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5807.909s">Jenny</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5810.89s">Melanie</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5813.131s">And</a> Kathy Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5814.491s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5816.011s">Great,</a> three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5821.793s">Sorry,</a> we're late. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5822.575s">We</a> may have taken some of those minutes we got out early last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5828.125s">Motion</a> to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5833.756s">Member</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5834.758s">Member</a> McLaughlin, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4ew4tBIRXk&t=5836.622s">Member</a> Kreatz, yes.<h2><a href="../2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E/2021-05-24_BrSC8V8no0E.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1919.112s">Motion</a> to approve with amendments for the correct phone numbers for reporting at all levels.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6921.329s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6922.59s">The</a> resolution that the advisory committee passed to bring to us lays out the work that they've done to date and the work that they feel like they need, and they have indicated in their letter that they will be ready at any date of our choosing any time after June 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6939.65s">And</a> so I believe them and take them at their word when they tell us that they know what work it is that they have ahead of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6947.972s">So</a> I feel like June 7th is a really reasonable date given what they have outlined for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8226.07s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8227.731s">You</a> know, I think one of the possible opportunities with this resolution is that we refer to the engagement communications and strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8240.522s">We</a> just heard about the new Harvard superintendent in residence who has apparently like very deep expertise in family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8252.431s">And</a> to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8253.879s">this</a> resolution is all about family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8256.52s">It's</a> all about keeping parents and students on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8262.462s">There</a> are other purposes, but I think, you know, I can't communicate simultaneously with my child's teacher and them. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8271.346s">That's</a> like not as big of a deal in elementary school, but it's a really big deal in middle school when communication to parents drops off completely, it's like a cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8280.669s">So</a> I would like to see this committee endorse the fact that this is a priority in terms of family engagement and acknowledge that it's not without challenges and send it to the subcommittee on family engagement to work through this in a meaningful way, probably at the start of the next school year, given the rest of our calendar.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8641.927s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9476.035s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9477.216s">I</a> was going to suggest that we also ask the rules policy and equity subcommittee to follow the proceedings over the course of the next several weeks and months really to present the school committee of policy on remote participation that's compliant with the law that preserves, I think the increased participation we have seen because of Zoom <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9504.268s">Um,</a> which I think we all agree is a plus and, um, also sort of navigates, you know, lots of rules yet to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9513.175s">So</a> I would like to see us, um, ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9516.537s">The</a> rules, policy and equity subcommittee to take this on and present something back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9521.481s">And</a> it may even take until, you know, September of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9525.004s">But,</a> um, as member Van der Kloot said, there are, there are times and reasons why having remote meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9532.458s">would</a> continue to make sense if it's allowed by law for members. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9537.0s">Certainly</a> I don't wanna lose the participation that we've experienced and the options that affords working parents to be able to join us for these meetings and go back to what we used to see in city hall chambers, which was an audience of two or three at most. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9558.091s">So</a> I would like the rules, policy and equity subcommittee to take that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9562.6s">as</a> it unfolds. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9563.78s">And</a> then I think the other thing that I will say is being a regular watcher of the city council meetings, I don't find them to be easy to watch in the current format. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9574.622s">So</a> I would also be interested in what changes are coming to chambers because I don't find those meetings very easy to watch right now with the way the camera angles are set. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9587.365s">And</a> it's just, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9589.802s">it's</a> a real, and maybe it's just a very stark contrast with the luxuries that you get when you're looking at a Zoom screen and you can see the people speaking quite clearly, and the closed captioning that Zoom affords. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9603.888s">I</a> just wanna make sure we're not losing some of those capabilities as we make this transition, because I think the public has appreciated them.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4482.966s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4488.443s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4490.405s">I</a> really appreciated the attention to professional development that was laid out in the superintendent's recommendations and certainly train the trainer models can be really effective as long as there is a sustainability plan that comes with the train the trainer and it's not a <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4508.951s">an</a> initial startup thing that sort of fizzles out because starting over in a train the trainer plan is very expensive, so I just want to make sure that we have sustainability plans in place to really maximize that investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4523.849s">On</a> the topic of transportation, I would like to make a motion that the budget include or assumes that there will be no cost to transportation for our students effective at the beginning of the 21-22 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4540.505s">And</a> that the administration will bring to us a comprehensive plan that sort of lays out a recommendation around transportation for the district between now and August 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4556.365s">And</a> the reason that I added that at the end is because <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4560.669s">I</a> have heard overwhelmingly from people that kids taking the MBTA bus means that they're often late, and that it's not reliable, and parents are making other arrangements to get their kids to school because they don't feel they can trust the MBTA buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4577.057s">The</a> notion that there are yet other students who really rely on those MBTA bus passes so that they <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4584.36s">can</a> work and can travel on the bus in a different way is not something that I've personally heard, but I don't want to discount the fact that there are community members out there who are in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4595.928s">So</a> I would like for us to revisit transportation and for you all to work with Eastern Bus and the police department and whomever <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4606.714s">and</a> hopefully the community to figure out like what is the best path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4611.355s">I</a> will also say Dr. Cushing that I do remember the conversation about the one versus two mile radius and the like non-enforcement of the radius at the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4624.917s">When</a> Mr. Murphy was talking about kindergarten being an exception, I guess I started to think like if you enforce like that, <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4634.686s">one</a> mile versus two miles or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4637.146s">And</a> yet you still have to pick up kindergartners in a place where you wouldn't before. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4640.347s">Like</a> how do you practically or tactically only pick up kindergartners in that like closer radius? <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4646.208s">So</a> I feel like there's like a lot of conversation around transportation to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4652.009s">But</a> I want unequivocally the budget to reflect that it will not cost students to get themselves to school next year, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4675.726s">Would</a> you like to call the roll or should I ask my other questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">I'm</a> gonna assume that the finance team can figure that out between now and the time the final budget is presented to us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">So</a> the budget will include an assumption that it does not cost money to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4911.62s">And</a> the revised transportation plan and strategy is not something that can reasonably be done before that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4919.621s">So</a> that is what would take until August 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4922.662s">Like</a> the details of, is it that the MBTA passes are just free for everybody or is it the strategy that there is a yellow bus and is the strategy that we're changing <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4934.485s">radius</a> from one mile to two miles, all of that obviously has budget implications as does literally everything that happens in the district after we pass the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4945.43s">But</a> the budget needs to reflect a cost capacity that allows us to not require students to pay to come to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4958.496s">Is</a> that clear, Mr. Murphy?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5184.07s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">No,</a> I mean, if the law contemplates students walking to school, I'm fine with that continuing to be the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5258.646s">I'm</a> not asking for us to bite off that piece of the apple personally, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5267.542s">I</a> am concerned about the people who are in excess of two miles from the school, who have to pay to get to school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5288.911s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5499.15s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5499.531s">I</a> was a little surprised not to see changes or position recommendations in the finance office because it's my sense that <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5512.955s">there's</a> always been too much work to do in that office for the number of staff that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5519.059s">What's</a> that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5523.442s">And</a> so, but there's no ask here to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5525.744s">Why</a> is that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5688.7s">And</a> then my final comment is just to say that I am not in favor of spending <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5696.835s">capital</a> funds on restroom rehab projects or the Karen Theater or the entrance until there is an actual master plan that addresses the long-term needs of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5710.946s">It's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5711.866s">It's</a> like a quarter of a million dollars all in, and it's just, it's not inconsequential when we are talking, <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5720.885s">like</a> 10 power professionals, many, many teachers, staff that we can't fit into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5729.01s">There's</a> a lot of other priorities than to spend without having a clear plan for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5739.548s">have</a> said this before, but the priority of having a clear plan for that building is critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5747.475s">And</a> until that happens, I can't support spending the community's dollars in a way that's going to pigeonhole us or tie our hands when it comes to the greater needs of that building, which are as yet unassessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5764.711s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">I</a> just wanted to say that I agree with member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6977.711s">It's</a> not about being opposed to any of those projects, in fact, and perhaps they all make sense, but the absence of information right now is putting us in a position where we could be making decisions to spend substantial amounts of the city's money in a frivolous way or in a way that makes it more complicated to <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6999.24s">do</a> what needs to be done when we actually talk to experts about what the needs are of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7004.766s">So</a> everyone you talk to has an opinion about what should happen to Medford High School, and I appreciate everybody's input, but there there will be a time and a place for us to consult with experts and outline <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7020.703s">what</a> the experts think needs to happen to the building and that hasn't been done to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7024.907s">So</a> for me I am not opposed to any of these expenditures per se but I am opposed to us deciding that these expenditures are prudent or a good use of taxpayer dollars without experts to tell us that <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7043.283s">that's</a> in fact the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7044.784s">So</a> I do agree that we need to like move along and I think we need to do so with an open mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7050.788s">I</a> remember very distinctly when we walked around the building with the vision committee or the school committee right before the pandemic and I heard from people who had been seated on the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7067.278s">as</a> they talked and shattered in the hallway about what we could or could not possibly consider for the high school because of the science wing or because of the this and because of the that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7080.191s">And</a> I would encourage us all to put our opinions <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7083.394s">aside</a> and really come up with a plan that allows us to understand what the building's needs are so that we can move quickly to start to achieve some of those objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7095.783s">And</a> the final thing I'll say is while we had a conversation about the capital plan, we did not build a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7104.308s">So</a> that $800,000, it's not my impression there's any shortage of projects, including multiple end of life roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7112.454s">like</a> coming up here very quickly that the comprehensive capital plan didn't account for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7120.88s">So</a> I think we have a lot of work to do on our capital plan so that we can be good partners to the rest of city government and help ensure that the needs of our district are met and that we don't run into a situation where we stop maintaining things <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7138.97s">and</a> find ourselves in another like pandemic situation where there's like oodles of work to do to bring buildings back to standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7146.076s">So</a> I'm a complete proponent of us prioritizing that capital plan in a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7153.522s">I'm</a> not a structural engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7154.763s">I</a> don't believe anybody on this committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7156.464s">So</a> I would like us to prioritize that kind of expertise as we talk about plans to spend significant taxpayer dollars, but also, <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7167.132s">I</a> don't believe we have to wait years and years and years for that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7170.755s">I</a> do think the students that go there right now are very important and in fairness to them, and really, frankly, every student that's currently in Medford public schools, the time is now for us to move on this priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7185.587s">my</a> kids likely would not graduate from a high school that looks any different than it does today. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7191.469s">So</a> if we're lucky, the first graders and the kindergartners might have a shot at something different, but only if we act. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7198.61s">So</a> it's incumbent on us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7200.751s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2021-05-18_UyRSZHmpAdI/2021-05-18_UyRSZHmpAdI.html">Budget Hearing:  Academic Programming Continued</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4975.057s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4975.617s">I</a> had some questions about
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4982.103s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4985.625s">I</a> had some questions about the math department to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4990.727s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4990.968s">Khan,</a> based on what you were saying, I think what I heard was that we weren't going to continue down the path of picking a math curriculum, but instead we are gonna go with the Envisions Math 2020 curriculum.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5026.561s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5027.101s">So</a> we are still planning to do a selection for a new program in one year? <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5033.144s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5033.991s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5036.072s">So</a> while we may not be set up to support math coaches, I do have a question about why we're only set up to support interventionists at the middle school and not at the elementary school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5200.527s">So</a> in what year will we expect to see interventionists and math coaches at the elementary school?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5216.593s">And</a> we're not doing either one of them next year in elementary?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5412.94s">The</a> other question I had about math is the number on the slide said 255. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5417.942s">And</a> I can't find a way that these numbers on my paper add to 255. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5422.744s">So</a> what thing that's on my paper doesn't actually fit into the slide that you showed us?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5486.73s">Is</a> the intent that the 255 equals the critical 22 budget priorities, the additional budget priorities worthy of consideration and the COVID mitigation priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5499.354s">Is</a> that the intent?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5509.577s">The</a> one that was presented in this meeting earlier.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5516.05s">They're</a> just, I just want to be crystal clear what we will ultimately vote on at the end of tonight, because it was, in every vote I've ever taken on this topic.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5529.379s">Those</a> three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5530.299s">In</a> every vote I've ever taken on this topic, I have been under the understanding that we are including all four categories, which also includes the long-term priorities, and now I'm being told we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5539.845s">So</a> I just want to be super clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5543.346s">what</a> is in when we say we're voting for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5546.107s">So</a> that if there's something that's not in that we feel like should be in, we can be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5551.328s">So</a> that that doesn't have to wait until June 1st for us to deal with.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5712.156s">Yeah,</a> and I can understand eight being a number that is hard to manage, but zero is also a number that is equally unpalatable for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5723.024s">I</a> mean, we're coming out of, you know, we have a deficient curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5728.048s">Our</a> test scores show that we have a lot of work to do in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5731.178s">We</a> got rid of our coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5733.42s">We</a> had an 18-month pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5736.782s">We</a> have students who are behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5738.663s">We're</a> going to pilot new curricula, but we don't need any more staff to make that successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5743.407s">I'm</a> really struggling with how that is all feasibly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5747.269s">And</a> frankly, when you install new curricula, having the folks who are going to need to coach and lead be at the front of that is always preferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5759.016s">from</a> an expertise perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5760.716s">So</a> I'm not entirely comfortable with going with zero.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=5806.523s">Okay,</a> I have several other questions, Mayor, so I don't know if you want me to keep asking them or if you want me not to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7124.943s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7127.624s">Regarding</a> the instructional technology narrative, I think there is a typo in the number of librarian staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7136.689s">My</a> understanding is the elementary school, there is a half-time librarian for four elementary schools, not a full FTE. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7144.033s">Is</a> that still true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7155.462s">And</a> I also wanted to comment about the fact that there is no plan in the short or long term to increase the level of librarian support, which is to the detriment of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7170.514s">I</a> just, I can't believe that nobody is asking for more librarian support. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7175.478s">There's</a> 2000 elementary school students and we have a half time librarian to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7180.742s">2000</a> elementary school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7182.463s">There's</a> no way that that what that halftime person can can instruct meaningful curriculum at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7191.229s">There's</a> certainly no way she can build it, which is what I understand is supposed to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7196.692s">The</a> paraprofessionals are not the people who are supposed to be taking the those reins. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7202.256s">So</a> I think we have a significant problem and a massive understaffing in that <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7209.083s">space</a> and I'm a little bit surprised to see that once again this year we aren't asking for anything more. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7214.209s">I</a> also wanted to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7224.389s">I</a> am not in support of spending district funds for resources who don't have professional qualifications to do work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7230.836s">So</a> if we are paying people to lead working groups around our website and the quality of the content, I would ask that we spend it on somebody with professional qualifications in that area and not just simply somebody who happens <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7248.226s">have</a> been around the district and happens to be available to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7253.53s">It's</a> an art and a trade unto itself, just like public education is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7259.375s">So</a> I want to see us spend the district's money wisely, and I frankly don't think that's a wise investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7268.75s">I</a> would also say that the district can't, in all fairness, think that they can meet the expectations of the consumer of the website without engaging the consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7280.597s">So</a> again, I'm not sure what the objectives of that working group are. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7284.099s">I</a> know that we passed unanimously a resolution to have a cohesive strategic plan around communication <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7295.134s">and</a> I don't think that we're headed in the right direction at all to get there based on what I heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7303.356s">And</a> then the other comment that I'll make is I am all for a reorganization that allows us to prioritize a family engagement person. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7311.918s">I</a> look forward to seeing the job description so that we can all agree on what the professional qualifications of that role are and <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7320.62s">If</a> that means that in order to fill the role, we need to look outside the organization to find someone with the proper qualifications, professionally speaking, that we should do that and we should not just be looking to shuffle people around to give them new titles if they don't have the professional qualifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7341.509s">So</a> I just want to make sure we take that hiring seriously because it's critically important <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7346.15s">Communication</a> has been a problem in our district since I have been a parent in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7352.212s">And</a> we've taken a lot of measures this year to improve things, but there is still a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7357.394s">And</a> without the right expertise, we are not gonna be able to continue moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7365.165s">And</a> then my last question, actually I have two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7369.146s">It</a> was my understanding that we had to move MCAS at the high school because there was an internet issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7373.327s">So</a> are we, if the capital expenditures that were outlined tonight come to reality, will we not have those problems in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7387.552s">Is</a> this enough?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7487.376s">Yeah,</a> and I guess I have some questions about whether we have the right expertise in-house to make sure that what we're saying is how we should spend capital funds is actually going to get us the results that we need, or if we need some other expertise to help advise about what is the right path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7509.728s">I</a> don't know, do other school districts have <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7513.39s">to</a> shut down MCAS because of a hacker. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7515.872s">I</a> haven't heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7517.854s">It</a> doesn't mean it's not happening everywhere, but I just feel like there's some stone unturned that we need to get to so that we can have a real plan that says this is what <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7531.916s">we</a> need to make this building viable, to make our network viable, to make instruction viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7537.738s">And</a> I'm just not convinced that we are there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7543.26s">So</a> I don't know what that person's expertise would be or how or who it is that we might need, but I think we need some assistance at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7553.424s">Like</a> we've been at this for a year and we still have students who it's not just, <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7558.126s">like</a> that it's hard for them to get online like they're at home learning remotely because they cannot access their their remote teachers so that's that's a fact it is happening um we've been at this for a year and it's it's dramatically improved but it's still just this huge problem and we have to we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7579.508s">fix</a> it completely at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7581.549s">And</a> I would like to see us do that expeditiously because we sort of are already past the window of opportunity there for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7591.036s">And</a> then my final question is, when does the school committee get to know about the capital funds that have been appropriated to the school district?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7903.51s">So</a> I just want to point out that the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee was completely unaware of this working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7912.596s">And</a> I think we've had a lot of discussion in that group about the desire to make the website <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7920.04s">more</a> functional at its minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7923.963s">So</a> I look forward to a discussion with the working team that's been established that doesn't include the school committee or the public so that we can sort of close that gap because the entire key to an effective website is understanding who you're trying to reach and having a path to like get to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7943.877s">And</a> I don't know how you do that without talking to those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7947.358s">And</a> then, you know, as it relates to making sure we have the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7952.941s">technical</a> expertise to grapple with the realities of, you know, sort of all that we still have to do from a network access and security space. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7965.347s">It's</a> my impression that Mr. Arena has been working around the clock for the better part of a year and a half now trying to remediate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7973.871s">And</a> that he, you know, simply, we need to make sure he has the support he needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7978.112s">He's</a> one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7980.98s">And</a> if that means we need somebody to help us put together that cohesive plan to execute or to consult, I am in favor of that spending, because I don't think Mr. Arena can do this by himself.<h2><a href="../2021-05-13__ktinY_FSkU/2021-05-13__ktinY_FSkU.html">Budget Hearing:  Academic Departments</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3150.708s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3159.592s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3162.199s">I</a> thought at the beginning of your conversation about the grant, you said that the reason that we couldn't move faster in replacing the journey's curriculum is because the teachers can't absorb two new curricula at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3173.947s">So</a> effectively math and reading at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3176.769s">But</a> if we get this grant that magically that problem goes away?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3318.213s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3318.914s">Yeah,</a> and as somebody who spends most of my professional life educating adults, it's not about intellectual capacity, but you get out what you put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3330.342s">So</a> I'm completely in support of not drowning our teachers in new content. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3336.706s">I</a> think that's really unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3338.468s">It's</a> not fair to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3340.229s">It's</a> definitely noteworthy in the middle of a pandemic <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3344.532s">recovery</a> and a pretty considerable set of variety that we will see in the classroom come fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3354.539s">I</a> think differentiated learning is going to be harder than it's ever been before because I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3360.343s">the</a> pandemic has not impacted every student in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3363.465s">So</a> I think that all of those complexities, like I still remain concerned about that, but I also remain concerned about all of the kids that we are not serving with our ELA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3377.152s">And</a> I would ask that regardless of whether we get this grant, we do all the creative thinking you plan to do about how to juggle this, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3388.311s">Anyway,</a> and whatever support you need, let's talk about what that support is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3394.154s">We</a> talked about two different ESSER grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3397.435s">There's</a> American Rescue Plan money coming to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3401.736s">The</a> grant funding certainly is a very big deal and it would be welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3408.155s">if</a> there is a way for us to be much more creative about how we accomplish these goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3413.079s">Like,</a> unfortunately, we have a lot of curriculum deficiencies, particularly at the elementary level, and those only built. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3423.568s">So</a> fixing those at the foundation will pay off in spades. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3428.452s">So</a> I would just ask that you all do that creative thinking regardless of whether this grant comes through and figure out how to move faster on behalf of the students.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3513.952s">Yeah,</a> and I would just close by saying, I think all the ways that we're supplementing are an indicator that our program is deficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3523.596s">So</a> I don't care if it's 10 years old, if it's still good, but it's deficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3528.538s">And</a> that's sort of unequivocal at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3532.819s">So</a> I think, to me, that's the big driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3535.54s">The</a> age doesn't bother me if we feel like it's supporting things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3540.562s">When</a> we're bolting all kinds of things onto something, the foundational issue there is what we have isn't working, and we're working really hard to make it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3552.587s">And</a> I would just challenge that if we have to work that hard to like bolt lots of things to it, then it is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3560.069s">And</a> we need to sort of solve that root cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3562.55s">Otherwise,</a> we're going to spend a lot more energy trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3567.027s">sort</a> of make up the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3568.788s">So</a> I just want to make sure that you all know that I am absolutely in support of whatever you need from this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3576.913s">I</a> think it would be a more than appropriate use of funds in any of those categories to figure out how we do this more quickly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6312.891s">The</a> only other question I had about the fine arts budget, and maybe it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6317.335s">I</a> think it's sort of related to the phys ed budget in in some regards, but I would ask that we think about how we determine <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6328.921s">replacement</a> costs of equipment in the same fashion for fine arts as we do in athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6335.563s">And</a> I would say the same of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6337.964s">So</a> I believe that on the athletic side we do as a district subsidize transport for some amount of athletic <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6348.375s">Travel</a> and if we are subsidizing for athletics, we should be subsidizing for the fine arts travel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6355.861s">So</a> whatever that like whatever that that decision making is, I would ask that we apply it consistently across those departments, because I think they speak to like <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6367.527s">what</a> brings joy in learning to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6372.611s">And</a> that may not be to all students, but there are students who uniquely find their home in either of those places, whether it be athletics or fine arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6383.64s">So</a> I would just wanna make sure that we are looking across departments and making sure that we are making concrete and similar choices for both of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6396.711s">Subject</a> areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6398.392s">And</a> I would say, you know, last in last year's budget, we had a conversation around supply like <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6404.835s">office</a> supplies for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6406.916s">And</a> there was just like this flat amount of money being issued to each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6410.977s">And</a> I would say that that doesn't feel super defensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6414.599s">Like</a> when I think about how supplies are consumed, it seems to me that a building with a hundred more students in it needs more supplies than the building with a hundred less students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6424.222s">But</a> yet we've sort of always applied the same number and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6428.604s">All</a> elementary schools are created equal, so there are some places and opportunities like that in the budget where understanding the basis for evaluation of like what constitutes a rational budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6439.736s">makes</a> a lot of sense, this is one of those places for me that you know sort of jumps out at me when we when we when I think about athletics and. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6447.024s">and</a> fine arts, but there are other places in the budget where I think there's similar opportunity for us to say, like, what is the basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6453.267s">And</a> then it becomes not a discussion about, is this enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6457.409s">And</a> does one school have more than the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6460.17s">Because</a> we have something defensible to fall back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6462.351s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6465.272s">Member</a> van der Kloot?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6953.451s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6953.931s">Yes,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6956.263s">I</a> just wanted to make a motion to accept the recommendations outlined tonight in the superintendent's draft recommendations across all the categories to be included in the budget for May 19th.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7179.771s">My</a> question was about, I thought that last year there was some issue about posting requirements in that the budget hearing has to go in the newspaper some amount of time ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7191.696s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7244.35s">And</a> I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7246.084s">I</a> would agree that having that budget hearing and ultimately the vote of what we will send to the mayor's office as our request should not be on the same night as we're like sort of wrapping everything else up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7260.812s">But</a> I actually also wanna say that I don't want that to languish. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7264.974s">Like</a> I think that is an important thing for us to get done in the month of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7268.196s">I</a> don't want to delay because I think in all fairness to the rest of the community that, <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7276.06s">The</a> mayor's going to need that for her consideration, the council is going to want to know what we had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7280.342s">And</a> as you mentioned like all of that has to like fall into place in order for us to then come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7289.666s">deal</a> with whatever appropriation is allotted to Medford Public Schools and make those final decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7295.571s">So</a> I would still wanna see that budget hearing happen in the month of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7300.095s">So</a> I would like to get that on the calendar as quickly as possible.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3406.469s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3408.37s">I</a> had a health services question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3412.231s">Under</a> additional budget priorities worthy of consideration, there's this notion of developing a Medicaid billing team. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3419.694s">And</a> I was just curious what revenue is generated to Medford Public Schools today for Medicaid billing and what we would anticipate being generated to Medford Public Schools were we to invest in additional staff to facilitate that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3529.339s">Yeah,</a> and I am wholly on board with maximizing our revenue, but I would only be in favor of this if the revenue actually comes to Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3543.744s">So</a> if we have to decide how to spend our precious budget dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3550.055s">we</a> can't be spending them to generate revenue that does not return back to the district directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3557.797s">There's</a> also statewide legislation pending that would require that, but in the meantime, I think it's an investment worth making as long as the return is there to offset the cost.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3601.705s">Yeah,</a> insurance billing is a beast unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3605.446s">Exactly,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3607.086s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3608.747s">And</a> then I did have a question for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3610.707s">Schulman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3611.527s">I</a> wondered if you could talk about the factors that go into what a particular building needs, because when I look at the distribution of adjustment Councilors versus school psychologists versus BCBAs, <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3627.539s">I</a> can't correlate how staff are distributed among buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3632.582s">It</a> doesn't match IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3637.344s">It</a> doesn't seem like there is an actual basis for those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3641.466s">So</a> can you describe where we're headed?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3715.457s">So</a> I think you're saying there's a method to the madness and it's okay the way it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3719.941s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3720.802s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3722.524s">And</a> so can we try to find a way to describe why this is? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3728.119s">rational,</a> like it just doesn't look super rational. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3733.883s">And</a> it's really hard to, I think intuitively, I'm sure my colleagues agree with me that there's a widespread acknowledgement that we need additional support at the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3750.494s">I</a> don't think there's an argument about <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3754.197s">The</a> need in a like macro sense, but like to understand like where does where does the need plug in and is it enough, I feel like I don't know how to evaluate that at the moment because. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3766.15s">There</a> doesn't like there's there's no rationale that makes these numbers sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3772.213s">make</a> sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3773.274s">So</a> it's hard to say like if everything's okay right now are we just like incrementally adding to everybody or are we trying to fix a structural deficit somewhere like what what is the goal of the additional staff and is it enough?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3890.479s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3893.7s">And</a> my last question is on the sheet that was provided to us about special education program across the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3903.523s">I</a> noticed that there are zero students listed in gen ed inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3909.485s">And</a> I wondered if that is typical for a district of our size.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3939.725s">at</a> some point to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3941.726s">I</a> don't have a sense for how many students are in co-teaching models. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3947.008s">I</a> don't have a sense for how many students are in inclusion models, nor what the holdbacks are if we're sort of out of alignment with what you would expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3960.553s">I</a> have no sense of how to evaluate that if we don't know what those numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3966.296s">So</a> I think that would be very useful for the committee to understand because, again, if there's a structural, like a staffing deficit that is causing us to not be able to optimize those experiences for students who could benefit from them, I would want to be able to have that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=3986.485s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4827.532s">can</a> I ask a clarifying question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4840.781s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4843.783s">Member</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4844.323s">Stone,</a> through the chair, are you intending to include the COVID mitigation priorities in your motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6864.366s">I</a> just wanted to address what I think we've heard from the administration a couple of times now, which is that <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6873.059s">The</a> structure of our organization leaves a lot to be desired in terms of how it serves children. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6878.742s">And</a> before this school year is over, we'll be reviewing and revisiting the strategic plan that was put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6886.765s">And</a> while I don't expect the strategic plan to hold all the answers to what the specific <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6894.468s">look</a> of the organization should be, because that is not work that can be done in haste. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6902.257s">I</a> will absolutely be expecting the strategic plan to address when we will see <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6907.312s">the</a> recommendations around how the structure of our organization needs to change to reflect the needs of our district right now versus the way we have always organized the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6922.025s">I</a> am not interested in administrative positions because we have always had them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6927.89s">I</a> am interested in administrative positions because we need them to serve kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6933.935s">And</a> so I think that really does mean taking a very hard look at everything from how the departments are set up versus the schools are set up versus who has authority on what. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6948.208s">It</a> includes taking a very hard look at the fact that there are more IEPs at the Brooks School than there are at the McGlynn School, which is a staggering <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6958.057s">surface</a> observation tells me there's something very systemically wrong with how we identify children who need support and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6966.604s">And</a> the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6969.107s">So</a> I think that being fiscally responsible for me means making sure that the organization serves its mission and its purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6979.499s">And</a> I think we are sort of in the middle of the road on that on that matter right now like we we could be doing better and we should do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6989.429s">And</a> as we think about what those things are that we need to do better and be better at. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6995.255s">I</a> do think. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=6997.11s">In</a> the balance that will settle out some of the discomfort around what might happen in three years, because my expectation is that the district looks very, very different than it does to today, three years down the road so unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7012.625s">were</a> a strategic plan in place this conversation would be so much easier right now because we would be looking at what are the things we were going to do in three years and can we advance them into the district sooner, which avoids the the notion of some sort of a fiscal cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7029.698s">we</a> would be looking at what our needs are when we plan to have them and how does that how does that set of priorities and needs change based on the pandemic and because we don't have that plan well in place and known to the community we're sort of in this position where we're trying to like do a lot at the same time which includes rationalizing <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7050.866s">how</a> we spend money that the federal government has bestowed directly upon the district and presumably at some point money that has been bestowed to the city, as well as how do we help kids recover from what has been the most trying year that any adult on the call tonight can <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7073.505s">remember</a> in their history. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7074.866s">Imagine</a> if you were eight, how impactful and meaningful this is in your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7080.588s">As</a> well as, gee, we weren't where we wanted to be before the pandemic hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7086.411s">How</a> do we mush all of that together and come out with something that doesn't require us to just accept how we have always done business? <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7096.495s">I</a> am not afraid to spend money in the right now if it forces us to really be motivated to have those discussions, because those discussions have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7107.164s">They're</a> hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7107.904s">They're</a> uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7110.746s">And</a> if the only thing we do as a byproduct of serving kids right now is force those discussions, we will all be better off for it, and so will the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7124.557s">I</a> would like to move member Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7126.198s">Stone's</a> question if there are no more questions, but I did just want member Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7131.442s">Stone</a> to repeat her motion.<h2><a href="../2021-05-05_l7gva4i3Rmc/2021-05-05_l7gva4i3Rmc.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=791.911s">I</a> don't have a problem with three minutes necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=798.215s">I</a> actually think many people who participate don't speak for three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=806.499s">I</a> think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=811.387s">uphold</a> our rules and have some clear procedures on how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=816.369s">Because</a> the places where our public comment has gone on for many, many, many hours is not because any one person at one time spoke for more than three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=828.434s">It's</a> that the same person spoke many, many times for three minutes and that there were a lot of people who wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=839.311s">given</a> that, like, I don't have a strong opinion about two versus three. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=845.016s">I</a> like, I think there are times where the difference is important and giving somebody three minutes to, like, give us their sort of fully baked thought is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=857.427s">Especially</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=862.42s">if</a> it's something that is evolving as they're listening to the conversation that's unfolding, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=869.663s">So</a> it's not like you're necessarily limiting people who came prepared to talk about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=876.366s">So</a> I don't have a problem with up to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=883.249s">I</a> would hesitate to put in place <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=892.62s">the</a> time limit, because I feel like that's too far gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=900.643s">But</a> I feel really strongly that we need to uphold our rules that we have set. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=904.764s">So</a> when we moved to a two minute comment, that was actually done without the committee's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=911.607s">And</a> I wanna make sure that whatever rules we set, they are adhered to, and that there's just a clear process for that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1350.539s">I</a> didn't have any significant questions or changes to this policy revision in general, but I do think it would be wise for us to explicitly call out that there will be a timekeeper that is managing public participation, whether it be three minutes or five minutes, and that speakers will get a 15-second warning <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1378.923s">when</a> they're approaching their time limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1381.466s">And</a> I do think, you know, obviously that has some implications about how the meetings are run and who does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1387.752s">And</a> that would need to be a role for somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1390.675s">But</a> I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1394.242s">When</a> Lisa has played that timekeeper role for us a couple of times, and I thought it's been very effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1402.205s">And</a> I would like to see us adhere to that as standard practice versus only sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1409.888s">So</a> I would like to see us be much more consistent about that timekeeping process so that <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1418.702s">people</a> know what to expect when they come to a meeting and everyone is clear upfront that there will be that timekeeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1427.145s">And</a> this is how they'll signal that we're out of time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=1767.771s">I</a> don't have any changes or issues with what's been outlined.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2376.083s">I</a> do, I think that makes a lot of sense and provides assurances that we don't end up <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2382.839s">wading</a> into unallowed territory on the floor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2479.614s">Dr.</a> Cushing, can you make Melanie a co-host so she can unmute? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2485.116s">Okay,</a> good.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2794.425s">So,</a> yeah, I just, I guess what I'm thinking about is that the vast majority of people who come to speak at a meeting, whether it's in person or even on zoom, like the majority of people are <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2813.387s">behaving</a> in a manner that allows constructive dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2818.849s">And</a> there are some that don't, but at the same time, I feel like we can't get into the business of saying there can't be more than five people in chambers with a red shirt on. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2833.754s">And</a> so to police <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2836.921s">There</a> can't be more than five people with a red background. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2839.303s">Like</a> I just feel like it's such sticky territory that I would rather maybe keep the faith in our residents because I think they deserve it, that this on the whole can go well. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=2855.136s">And</a> I think if it becomes a recurring issue, we may need to revisit it, but I'd rather not be preemptive about this particular issue.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=3128.185s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=3129.306s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=3134.429s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=4357.588s">Before</a> you continue, I think in a prior meeting, we talked about the committee of the wholes and the special meetings being part of the consent agenda, superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=4368.573s">Um</a> because they because they are attended by the entire group we're really just approving minutes where the report of committees the because they are subcommittees they are not attended by everybody and the the the chair typically provides an update and then the minutes are voted on so I think this was <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=4390.359s">I</a> think the original intent was just simply that this was the subcommittees because there would be like an actual report out and then approving the minutes versus like the committee of the holes are just going to be part of the consent agenda, which is a little bit further down where we are just like in one fell swoop, approving all of that stuff without discussion, because it's just a matter of approving minutes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=5000.622s">I</a> was gonna make a suggestion that the next meetings part become an appendix so that there's no obligation for the chair to be reading off like the list, but instead it's just available as part of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=5017.411s">So</a> I think the condolences could be read, the meeting could be adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=5022.773s">they</a> don't, this list doesn't need to be read out loud, but just simply the fact that it's there, I think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=5030.379s">So</a> I just, you know, when we get to the end of the meeting, whatever time that may be, like reading this list is not gonna be meaningful for anybody as so much as having it on the agenda would be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=5206.727s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=6334.927s">Perhaps</a> at the end of the policy, we can just add a line that says related policies and put a link in there to our bullying policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7gva4i3Rmc&t=6344.512s">And</a> I think that covers us.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3863.563s">I</a> just had some additional questions about the health curriculum, but I would defer if there's questions about P before we cycle back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3873.629s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3878.555s">I</a> don't feel like I totally, and maybe it's just sort of where I've entered this conversation, but I don't feel like I totally understand when you said we tried this and we liked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3889.466s">I</a> don't understand what the methodology was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3892.749s">Did</a> we try two things and we liked this better? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3896.292s">Do</a> you think that there would be a change of that opinion when there are dedicated health professionals, particularly at the middle school level rather than guidance Councilors conducting this training? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3906.577s">I</a> mean, just overall, like there's just nothing stand out about the description of the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3914.06s">And</a> maybe that's just the description, I'm not sure, but I'm just curious, like what is so great about this curriculum that we have in place?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4018.491s">I</a> just. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4019.672s">This</a> the scope and sequence seems so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4023.894s">Slow</a> to me in terms of like when topics are being covered and I. That is just sort of my reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4031.999s">I.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4040.647s">There</a> are fourth grade girls who get their period. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4043.991s">All</a> of these things, like as long as we might want these <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4053.796s">life</a> decisions to be put off as adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4058.698s">We</a> can want that all we want, but it's education's job to prepare students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4065.161s">And</a> I don't have a huge comfort level that we're preparing our students as best we could at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4074.765s">That</a> doesn't mean the curriculum is not capable of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4078.326s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4079.107s">There</a> is still a huge gap for me that I haven't <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4082.628s">been</a> able to reconcile based on this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4085.23s">And</a> I just want to make sure that if there's something that you need to really have us all feel good, and you're the expert, so I care more about what you think than what I think, but I want us to feel like we are being modern in our approach and that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4111.785s">making</a> sure that we are preparing students for the life that they will live, whether we prepare them or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4119.588s">And</a> however we need to do that, if that is this curriculum, that's fabulous news, it's already in house, but if there's something else that is needed, I just want us to identify that as quickly as possible so that we can get it in place.<h2><a href="../2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA/2021-05-03_s_C3Q_KGMQA.html">Budget Meeting:  Elementary and Secondary</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3281.694s">I</a> think my first question is, are we going to talk about high school tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3285.097s">Because</a> I thought we were going through the whole presentation before we fielded questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3334.056s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3336.067s">I</a> think that the main question I had about elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3339.148s">I</a> mean, I think there's plenty of questions to be asked, but when we talk about this restoration of this special. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3345.429s">I</a> understand in concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3350.69s">What</a> you described as the need, but I do not practically understand like what does that mean from a staffing perspective like I don't see a staffing ask associated with supporting this special. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3364.29s">or</a> like, I can't picture in my mind what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3367.892s">So</a> I was just curious, like, is there a budget implication to what is being recommended?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3432.918s">And</a> is that represented in this packet somewhere?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3520.396s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3522.778s">And</a> I think my other question in general is, <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3526.193s">This</a> is informative, but it's not a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3530.655s">Like</a> it's not yet a document that says here's what we're asking for, or is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3538.378s">That</a> was, this was like not, this is just a really different format and I'm fine with the format. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3544.821s">I'm</a> just trying to understand like, is everything on this list going to appear in a budget document on May 19th that we're gonna be asked to
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3795.046s">Yeah,</a> and I would say, you know, just sort of comparing this to past budgets, this budget is more ambitious than any budget I've seen the district put forward before. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3810.078s">And</a> I think in part it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3813.372s">due</a> to sort of our alignment with the best practices and how budgeting should come together at the school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3821.075s">So</a> I do think when I read through this, I was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3826.636s">All</a> these things are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3828.337s">They</a> seem on target with what <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3831.518s">we</a> need to do to restore the cuts that we incurred last year and to start to think about how to address students where they are when they come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3845.093s">So</a> I think overall like there was not a single thing on this list that I said <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3850.199s">we</a> don't need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3852.601s">We</a> could live without that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3854.182s">I</a> frankly think the whole list is a yes, if we're saying what we like or what we think is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3862.689s">And</a> I appreciated the cohesive nature of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3866.252s">I</a> think the other question that I had in my mind is, when I think about the process, I'm sort of anticipating that come May 19th, <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3877.587s">we're</a> going to want to be in a position to send up a budget that is approved by this committee so that the city has adequate time to review and ask their questions and react. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3892.233s">And</a> that there is time for the allocation to come back and for us to react to that number, whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3901.696s">So</a> in terms of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3904.409s">How</a> does this translate into the thing that we will be asked to approve on May 19th? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3910.591s">I</a> think the priorities the superintendent has outlined are on point and do a pretty remarkable job actually of lending sort of moving forward with restoring damage in lots of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3927.375s">So</a> thank you for the hard work and I, <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3934.983s">looking</a> forward to seeing all these numbers come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3937.224s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4347.363s">Can</a> I just make a quick point of information, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4350.498s">of</a> information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4353.643s">Member</a> Kreatz, I just wanted to highlight for you that the four elementary schools intended to submit grant requests to the WIN. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4365.33s">for</a> water filling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4367.092s">I</a> think one for each floor in each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4370.755s">I</a> know that some of the elementary schools were successful, but there was a problem with the application, which was due Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4378.682s">It</a> was shut down on Friday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4382.265s">So</a> I'm not clear that all of the elementary schools got their grant request in. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4387.83s">It</a> was the intent that they would all <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4390.853s">send</a> the same thing and I'm just I'm not sure that they all got in because of the application issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4398.878s">But</a> the intent was to to try to lever that grant funding to provide some support there across all four elementary schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4408.604s">Thank</a> you for providing a question in that point of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4410.986s">I</a> it was a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4413.347s">I</a> was just trying to provide member credit information.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7218.296s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7218.856s">To</a> that end, I just also wanted to make a motion that the COVID mitigation priorities outlined in this <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7229.867s">presentation</a> are prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7232.689s">I</a> think sort of my assumption is that they would align well with ESSER funding, but would defer that to the administration in terms of how best to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7244.216s">But</a> in the end, when I look at what the school year looks like next year, I would like to make a motion that we see these things in real life in our schools <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7259.108s">come</a> September. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7260.049s">So</a> I would like to make a motion that these COVID mitigation priorities also be presented as part of the final budget for review and approval by this committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7283.869s">Sure,</a> the COVID mitigation priorities outlined in the presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7288.178s">will</a> be presented as part of the FY22 spend, whether it's part of the main budget or our plans to spend against our ESSER grant.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7314.887s">Everything</a> that's listed in the COVID mitigation priority buckets is in, we can see it in real life at the beginning of September, which means we, as a committee, will have been presented with a budget that approves the spending of these items.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7537.649s">Yeah,</a> so just like with member Mustone's motion, we would be saying that we are in support of the COVID mitigation priorities outlined here, and <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7553.149s">that</a> you all will advise us about how to put them in the right category in the final budget.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7563.876s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7565.997s">That's</a> the motion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7899.811s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-04-28_4OUqwVVt47Q/2021-04-28_4OUqwVVt47Q.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=15.697s">Paulette,</a> I just sent Paul a message to see if he happens to be available.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2411.939s">I</a> had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2414.48s">Go</a> ahead, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2418.096s">Mr.</a> Seery, I remember when the selection of the K to five curriculum was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2426.6s">It</a> was sort of noted at the time that the engineering STEM part of the curriculum was like not the biggest strength of FOSS and that we would have to supplement the curriculum in some way, shape or form to like kind of cover those bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2444.87s">Have</a> we done that or do we still need to do that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2520.92s">And</a> in terms of like Medford filling the gap that exists, do we think that we will be filling that gap in this upcoming school year or are we some number of years away from addressing that gap?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2566.077s">Okay,</a> so as we think about that overall curriculum catalog that kicked off a lot of these discussions, I think it would just be important for that to land there as a need for FY23 so that as a committee, we can be planning for that need proactively and really not find ourselves in the high school position that science finds itself in needing to replace literally everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2595.258s">So</a> that should go on the, just on the catalog as such so we can plan accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2601.923s">And</a> then you also mentioned about FOSS, that we were being creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2607.006s">Are</a> we being creative to save money or are we being creative because it's in the best interest of the curriculum?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2620.634s">You</a> were talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2624.078s">Oh,</a> some of the consumables.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2809.703s">I</a> have some additional questions, but I will send them to you via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2812.664s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4751.298s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4751.618s">I</a> thought so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4755.34s">Have</a> we asked the students if they prefer Quaver to what has happened in music at the K to five level in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4762.122s">Do</a> we know how students feel about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4764.463s">I</a> would be really interested to know if they prefer this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4886.695s">Yeah,</a> and the reason, Bernadette, the reason I was asking is because when I think about <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4893.245s">The</a> feedback I get in my household about music, I haven't received nearly as many complaints this year as I have in past years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4900.549s">And</a> I'm just gonna be really honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4905.231s">So</a> having said that, like, I just don't know if that's just because in the pandemic, like it just hasn't floated to the top of our conversation or if the students are enjoying it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4916.435s">And,</a> you know, so I just, I do feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4920.077s">From</a> my own personal experience, we have opportunity to engage and pull more students into music at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4929.163s">And</a> as we talk about the pipeline that grows into the middle school band and the high school band, I think there's a lot of opportunity to make sure that the elementary school kids really love it because it should be a topic that they love and look forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4948.313s">So,</a> and I think there, at least in my experience, there's a lot of untapped opportunity there for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4957.939s">And</a> I think the other couple of questions I had around the rental program, like do we have the same rules in place for instrument rentals as we do for athletic user fees? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4975.1s">So</a> if I'm on free and reduced lunch, do I get an instrument rental for free? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4979.943s">Or</a> if I'm on free lunch, do I get instrument rentals for free? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4986.167s">Or</a> is that just an atlas?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5118.782s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5120.583s">I</a> actually have seen a good number of, a good amount of chatter among school committee members across the state who are pursuing, you know, parity between fine arts programs and other student, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5135.835s">extracurricular</a> activities like athletics, which is why that was sort of top of mind for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5141.819s">And</a> just, you know, I just wanted to make sure I understood what our current program looked like right now so that I could think about, you know, how that fits into our overall goals of equity and accessibility and all that stuff.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3521.546s">Okay,</a> I'm glad to hear we're following the law as it's been laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3526.948s">The</a> other comment that I will make for my colleagues is that when I think about the budget and how we move forward, we need to be thinking about the funds that we did not receive last year, and then a modest increase on top of that, which does put us into the neighborhood of A plus B plus C on Mr. Murphy's slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3552.134s">As</a> far as I can tell, that really represents restoring the district from the layoffs, the pink slips, and all the other things that we had to do last year, given the funding issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3570.195s">And</a> I will <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3572.751s">be</a> looking to make sure that we are funding the things that we promised last year, like middle school health and reading specialists and addressing dyslexia in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3583.257s">So</a> I'm hopeful and we've had great conversations on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3586.719s">So</a> I am hopeful that the city is preparing for that, especially with the significant infusion of cash from the federal government coming our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3596.945s">So</a> that is what I will be looking for as we go into the budget meetings and <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3602.203s">I</a> hope that we don't have to pink slip hundreds of teachers again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3609.092s">Oh,</a> and the last thing I'll say is I'm also hopeful that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3613.762s">Um</a> do right by the staff across lots of bargaining units that have helped us navigate through this pandemic as we talk about, um, the negotiation of many collective bargaining agreements and central to those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3632.717s">Of</a> course, and reasonably are cost of living increases, and we as a city need to be prepared to Come to those conversations in good faith.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5033.745s">Thank</a> you, member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5037.683s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to acknowledge that this two-step process that is both a best practice and supported by law and regulation, I think is something that Medford just hasn't done before, which I think is why you're getting all of these questions, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5058.232s">Medford</a> has not operated in this best practice fashion in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5062.654s">And</a> I think it's time that we start doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5065.586s">And</a> that means two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5067.488s">And</a> that provides an outlet and an ability for the school committee to tell the city government what we need to support the students in our charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5080.64s">And</a> it also allows us a way to acknowledge <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5087.727s">whether</a> we're doing everything we can with the hand that we have been given. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5092.709s">Last</a> year, those two things were horribly muddy together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5096.111s">And</a> I think my comments at the time were about trying to make sure that my no vote was not construed as a criticism of making the best of a very bad budget situation and being supportive of the budget overall, which to me were two very different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5111.938s">And</a> so I am completely supportive of this two-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5116.625s">It</a> is a best practice for lots of good reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5119.727s">And</a> I am happy to have you on board to guide us through that best practice process so that we can do better for the students of Medford than we have been able to do in our past budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5134.238s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6462.888s">Thanks</a> for this update. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6465.409s">I</a> think what I would like to see as we talk about the budget for the transportation is what are those options and how would they fit into our budget when the transportation budget is presented to us because <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6483.374s">You</a> know it may be that the MBTA buses are not the most cost-effective way for us to provide free transportation to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6492.96s">My</a> understanding is the MBTA buses are also the reason that sort of hinder us in a regular year from doing late starts and all kinds of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6504.708s">So</a> as we kind of consider <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6509.251s">start</a> times, late starts, snow days, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6513.373s">I</a> think it's a conversation worth having, but I would want to have it in the context of the larger budget so that we can understand what those options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6520.737s">I</a> mean, this option sounds fine, but there may be a better cost-effective option we should pursue, and I want to make sure that we look at all of those.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7201.272s">Number</a> one was on our agenda and approved last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7204.855s">So</a> I think it was just left there in error. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7207.757s">We</a> can move on to number two.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7400.326s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7401.446s">So</a> I actually was asked by a member of the community about which person in the district did a certain thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7412.792s">And</a> it got me sort of wondering about our official job descriptions, which I wasn't able to put my hands on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7420.297s">But</a> I did go and look for our policy because I knew that we had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7423.638s">And</a> it struck me that it was <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7425.809s">very</a> outdated and doesn't reflect what I would consider to be best practice around roles and responsibilities, making sure that we are evolving positions as education changes and shifts as is just typical in any job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7444.997s">And</a> I wanted to put this forward as a recommendation to this policy because it was <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7453.413s">on</a> my mind at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7455.394s">And</a> I think just overall focusing on best practice and hygiene will really benefit the students ultimately, but all of us in the clarity of who is responsible for what, which allows the administration to hold staff accountable to their roles and provides clarity and transparency for the community.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7559.481s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7562.862s">So</a> the only thing by September 1st was a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7567.392s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7568.673s">That</a> was really, and that they be posted to the NPS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7573.838s">I</a> recognize that A, you don't want to be revising everybody's job all at the same time because it becomes an implementation problem if you are in a position of having to make changes at any given time to some number of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7588.792s">So</a> you want to, you don't want to big bang, the changes or the review of every job description in the house at the same time, which is why I provided for like a three year like roll in of the first iteration of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7604.607s">with</a> at least in my head, I would do that so that on an annual basis, there's some number of job descriptions that the committee is revising or saying is okay without it ever being like a process where we're looking at every single one at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7620.41s">So</a> to me, providing a list of the job descriptions that the community pays for as part of the school district should not be, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7634.773s">prohibitive,</a> which I think is the only ask by September of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7640.176s">And</a> then really providing a three-year ramp in to a good cadence of hygiene around how we hold our senior staff accountable makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7654.144s">And</a> I think at that point, you have the ability to do it in manageable chunks and to execute on change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7665.573s">and</a> you never get into a position where job descriptions are widely outdated, staff, and I'm not saying this happens here, but it happens all over the place, say, that's not in my job description and I'm not going to do it and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7680.424s">So</a> making sure that we have good structures in place in terms of policy from this committee so that the administration has our support as those changes are made and there's an expectation that it'd be done frequently, I think is to me pretty important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8108.005s">And</a> Mayor, the nomenclature actually comes from the existing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8112.486s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8113.826s">And</a> I was making an assumption that it was important because it <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8119.554s">seemed</a> like an odd word to me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8121.175s">So</a> if it's not important, I think permanent is fine.<h2><a href="../2021-04-26_4cMMuLS1xd0/2021-04-26_4cMMuLS1xd0.html">COW:  Columbus School Renaming Advisory Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8661.748s">I</a> would also say that the question about availability of supplements is something that is intended to be part of the catalog that is supposed to be coming out of all of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8674.352s">So</a> that it's clear what is available and what is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8677.874s">So</a> that to me, in my mind is definitely part of this work and the catalog that <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8686.436s">we</a> are working towards creating.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9419.548s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10008.664s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10393.112s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17501.769s">So</a> if we, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17504.711s">move</a> forward with it via the hopes to expand to these 60 seats and you find that you have qualified applicants in excess of what you need to expand the program, I'm making an assumption that you would expand the program beyond the 60 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17525.517s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17666.289s">Yeah,</a> and I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17667.81s">I</a> certainly don't think we can be in a position where we overcommit and cannot deliver in a big substantive way, because I think at that point, you would have no choice but to shut down big swaths of the program, which would not be what anybody is looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17687.063s">But</a> I will say that this committee has been told unequivocally by past administrators that space is not an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17694.168s">that</a> constrains us and at the time I didn't particularly believe it although I think the message was it's a it's a constraint that we can overcome with enough lead time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17706.14s">So</a> I guess what I would ask of all of you is if if the hiring becomes the <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17714.855s">If</a> our changes to the wage structures are such that staffing is no longer like the long tent in the pole, and you need something from this committee to allow a more rapid expansion than you're planning on, that you would come back to us and make sure that we prioritize <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17737.855s">taking</a> action on that as as fast as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17742.219s">Because</a> I do think there are a lot of families, you know, there are families on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17746.723s">We're</a> not even talking about the families who don't try to get on the list because they didn't even know they were supposed to be on a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17753.85s">Like</a> we, you know, I think even if we found a seat for every single person on the wait list, we're sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17759.959s">We're</a> only solving the part of the problem that's sort of loud and in our face, but we're not necessarily, I don't think we can say that we have solved the entire problem of afterschool care amongst elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17774.221s">I</a> do think there has to be some evolution here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17776.742s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17797.864s">Yeah,</a> completely agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17799.265s">So,</a> um, I, I would like to make a motion that we adopt the recommendations provided to us that provide wage increases for the afterschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17811.547s">staff</a> and the recommended rate increase for tuition for the after school program.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19085.308s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19087.469s">So</a> I guess I certainly would like to see that meeting happen, but I don't think it's reasonable for it to happen before the end of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19097.495s">And</a> specifically, <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19101.057s">there</a> is a tremendous amount of rebuilding work that has to happen in order to put the staff in place to even enact the the votes that we just took. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19109.821s">It</a> is also budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19111.341s">I</a> haven't heard what our budget numbers are so I have to imagine that will be like a broad scale massive scramble because it is the end we are approaching the middle of April at this point and we haven't you know we we haven't as a committee discussed the budget at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19127.628s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19129.509s">I</a> just I would like to make sure that the administration can make good on the directive the policy directives that we just provided around pay increases and more importantly the hiring that we think it will enable because we need to know sooner rather than later if that doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19151.668s">So</a> we need <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19153.65s">There</a> to be some prioritization of these activities so that we don't find ourselves heading into September without answers to this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19162.334s">And</a> I think we need to give the administration the space to actually act on the policy directives that we've just issued so. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19169.678s">I'm</a> completely on board with having a listening session. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19173.322s">I</a> think Miss Fiddler-Carrie is perfectly capable of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19177.407s">I</a> understand it here in Medford that there is a strong feeling that if you want something done, you must talk to the superintendent and the superintendent alone to get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19188.74s">And</a> I do look forward to a day where that is not the general feeling about how things get done in Medford, because I think the staff is much, much, much more capable than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19199.848s">But</a> in the meantime, if we are insistent that that happens, I think we need to give the administration the space to make sure that this meeting occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19211.015s">perhaps</a> before the start of the next school year so that they can actually do the work we've just asked them to do.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19795.038s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19799.08s">Through</a> the chair to Member McLaughlin, I just want you to know that this was the primary substance of <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19805.935s">the</a> conversation in the strategic planning roundtables for two nights in a row at the elementary school level, which is the group that I led. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19813.898s">So</a> we actually did talk very extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19819.32s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19819.52s">Galussi</a> was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19821.461s">both</a> nights, I believe the superintendent was in and out as she was with all the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19825.144s">So</a> I do want to make sure that you know, because we couldn't all be in all of those groups, that that was happening in our subgroup amongst a bunch of other dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19838.572s">So</a> we have done some of that work already. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19845.961s">But</a> I would definitely encourage the superintendent and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19851.263s">Fidler-Carey</a> and Mr. Murphy to reach out to some of these parents and engage with them further because they may, you know, they just may have perspective that helps solve problems a different way than in school administrators are thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19869.49s">I</a> don't know, maybe half of them want to spend two days a week working in the afterschool program and they create staffing for us that we just don't know about yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19877.514s">So</a> I do want you all to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19882.837s">I</a> just think the logistics of a big meeting may not be the most effective way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19889.46s">So</a> I do want to defer to the superintendent and her team about the most effective way for them to collect this feedback.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=20253.191s">Roll</a> call.<h2><a href="../2021-04-07_1FDL4VUFRG4/2021-04-07_1FDL4VUFRG4.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=384.688s">I</a> think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=386.309s">I</a> think there are probably some things that we can start to change and maybe we endeavor to change what we can accomplish in the next like 25 minutes or so in this meeting and recommend those changes, implement them, see if we like them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=406.357s">see</a> how they're working in practice and then solicit another round of feedback maybe at the beginning of the academic year and do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=416.181s">So</a> I do think we should not talk about this constantly, but instead maybe like twice a year or something between now and the time we just all feel like we're happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=429.187s">But</a> yeah, I agree, whatever we can accomplish <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=433.492s">in</a> this meeting that we feel good about recommending, we should start. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=436.413s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=580.644s">I</a> think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=584.847s">One</a> of the things that we also talked about was around sort of actively asking their opinion or asking for their vote in a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=598.141s">And</a> I feel like that conversation was fairly unresolved and we probably shouldn't try to incorporate that now, but perhaps the other thing that we could do where we, you know, we have a report of the secretary, like maybe there is a holding space for a report of our student representatives that we can put on the agenda and they can, just like the secretary does decline or have something to say, but really like intentionally give them some space on the agenda upfront.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=855.972s">I</a> guess I was just thinking of it as asking the secretary to add them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=860.73s">to</a> the list of the role that she calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=862.651s">Like</a> very simply add two names to the bottom of the list and call them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=870.575s">So</a> I don't think it's, I think it's more like asking the secretary to do it than it is changing the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=876.898s">Like</a> you have to call the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=878.479s">We're</a> just adding two people to the list.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=889.207s">I'm</a> trying to simply say we need to know when our student representatives are in the room, and we can't know that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=898.633s">I</a> never know if they're there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=933.521s">We</a> took the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=933.942s">We</a> called it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1503.147s">I</a> would like to see us move the approval of bills, the transfer of funds, and the minutes for any school committee or committee of the whole meeting to the end of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1514.996s">It's</a> just <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1516.822s">largely</a> paperwork that has to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1519.144s">I</a> would be happy to go to a consent agenda, but that might be too big of a change to enact quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1527.591s">But</a> I think those items in particular aren't items that I feel like the public is coming to listen to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1536.398s">I</a> think the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1538.757s">minutes</a> are different because we don't all attend all the committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1543.058s">So</a> I think it's important to have those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1546.819s">Those</a> subcommittees are not as well attended even by the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1552.62s">So</a> I would want to keep those at the front, but I would be interested in moving the rest to the back of the agenda so that I'm just really sensitive to all the people we make sit and wait for many, many, many hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1567.484s">through</a> stuff that is procedural.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1890.189s">Yeah,</a> and I think, I think, in the description of you know what our policy is and what the rules are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1897.037s">I</a> think we also have a responsibility to <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1901.181s">make</a> sure the public understands the role of public comment in our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1908.503s">We</a> often hear people, particularly when they disagree with us say, you haven't responded to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1915.364s">And</a> that is, I think, sort of one of those places where you see the gap of like, there are times where we cannot respond because we would be in violation of the open meeting law for not having posted a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1931.788s">So</a> I think there are some nuances in terms of like, what is the role of public comment and what is that there should really be no crosstalk right like that's that's not part of public comment under Roberts rules of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1947.462s">I</a> think there's sort of a human expectation that when you ask a question, somebody's going to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1955.331s">I</a> always want to answer questions, but I think we just need to be clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1963.678s">if</a> we're not answering a question, these are the reasons why that might happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1968.502s">So</a> that we can start to, because that's where our meetings go wildly out of control, is when those kinds of situations come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1979.469s">So</a> I think we would all be best served to have a clear set of, identify what our policy is about how long you may speak, how often you may speak in a given meeting or topic or like, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1992.438s">you</a> know, whatever the rules may be, you know, what you can and cannot do as part of your public comment and what, you know, what the committee cannot, can and cannot do in response so that we're just laying down the ground rules each and every time we have public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2012.426s">I</a> think there's also some interesting, I think there's a lot of gyrations in the public discourse about, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2020.926s">whether</a> we must have public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2026.15s">And</a> that's another sort of one of those places where Robert's rules, there's rules about that and the public sort of feels maybe differently about what those rules are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2038.798s">And</a> that's where our policies step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2040.78s">So</a> I just think it's important for us to be clear about what those things are because we need to have less, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2048.39s">um,</a> instances where our public comment sessions go completely off the rails, attack members, get out of control, hear from the same people 10 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2057.634s">We,</a> we have to, we have to rein that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2062.076s">I</a> am still really upset with what has been going on in our meetings and we can't continue to do it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2297.461s">I</a> just want to mention, I'm looking at a couple of agendas now and consent agendas do include warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2304.386s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2317.109s">I</a> am looking at agendas from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2323.731s">Can</a> you share those with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2327.513s">You</a> want me just to send you a link? <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2329.174s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2355.813s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2360.674s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2366.655s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2504.273s">While</a> you do that, can I ask Mr. Murphy a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2506.493s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2510.157s">I</a> have noticed this in a couple places, but I always am a little surprised that employee to student harassment is defined solely in the confines of conditions of participation in programs or the basis for decisions affecting students or grades like <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2529.35s">you</a> can simply harass another human without intending to affect their grade or their ability to get on a sports team. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2536.331s">And</a> that never seems to like be on the list of the definition of employee to student harassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2543.013s">Is</a> there a reason for, is there a legal reason for that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2652.575s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2652.956s">And</a> I guess, like, I've seen this a couple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2655.379s">Like,</a> I think the paperwork that I signed when I onboarded, I was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2658.977s">This</a> feels like really incomplete, but the bullet under student-to-student harassment, such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a student's performance or creating an intimidating or hostile learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2672.504s">Seems</a> like it should also be added under the employee-to-student harassment component.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2828.242s">I</a> don't have any.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2845.98s">Yes</a> member.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2909.355s">Yeah,</a> yep.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2920.443s">And</a> I think the, I don't know if the name of this policy is <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2929.036s">Like</a> I know our attorney recommended this policy to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2934.199s">I</a> think this really speaks to, it seems like it speaks more to student harassment than it does to like, as you mentioned, like employee to employee harassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2949.549s">So</a> I didn't know if the title needed to change or something else.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2975.264s">Just</a> wasn't, if it was, did.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2985.103s">Wasn't</a> sure if it was intended to be limited or like, is the intent to receive that limited to students or the intent on harassment?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3033.403s">Okay,</a> sorry, I was asking whether this policy was specifically governing student harassment or if this is our one and only policy on harassment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3164.05s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3228.633s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3229.113s">So,</a> I mean, I would like to make a motion that we move this forward as amended, but I also would be happy to motion to table it so that we can create a second reading of this policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3276.327s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3326.686s">And</a> while you pull that up, on page one, there is a reference to an assistant superintendent with some question marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3334.512s">And</a> one question I had is, who is this designated Title IX coordinator for Medford?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3707.388s">So</a> motion to table for the next meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3715.432s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=1776.494s">High</a> school.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4333.204s">So</a> we actually had a good conversation about a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4337.949s">So</a> I think, you know, overwhelmingly the participants in our group. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4342.133s">Had</a> a lot of passion at the elementary school level around making the after school programming more available to all those families who need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4351.641s">And</a> actually, I thought one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4353.962s">sort</a> of said that, you know, I'll sort of know we're making progress when, as a working parent, I can send my child to NPS and they can have after-school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4366.268s">That</a> is what, like, being able to access any of this statement means to me, which I thought was really <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4372.372s">compelling.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4373.553s">We</a> did talk a lot about the 21st century comment being really abstract, and we went on to talk about the notion of wanting <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4386.868s">to</a> ensure that we are creating critical thinkers, which is really sort of, I think we're at the beginning of that either success or failure really being very evident in our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4402.552s">So</a> being able to understand what is real, what is not, how to really critically think about the world around you, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4412.015s">When</a> people are being truthful or frankly they're not, which is I think the really scary part of like looking forward for me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4419.022s">And</a> they also we also talked about the fact that the education that we provide itself needs to be drawn from a diverse set of skills and backgrounds and I think that really taps into. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4436.08s">thoughts</a> for me anyway about ensuring that our curricula are up to date and are rigorous and can be accessed by all of our students, but also that they are reflecting our current knowledge and thinking across the world and across the profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4454.29s">So</a> I thought that was all like really, really good commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4458.052s">I</a> thought a couple of other things that came up a couple of times is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4463.775s">There</a> was an overwhelming comment about the plan feeling sort of incomplete at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4471.059s">So</a> just trying to kind of connect the dots of all the components and the one pager and like <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4479.102s">what</a> that really looks like as it comes to life and a lot of questions around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4484.584s">And</a> then I think the other conversation that we had that I thought was really excellent was around how do we measure that we're making progress and in sort of on the like contrasting side of measurement a feeling that just because it can't be quantified doesn't mean it should <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4505.23s">uh</a> not be prioritized so in other words there's a lot of things that are very hard to measure about what we do in public school systems and just because we can't put a number to it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve prioritization so that we really have our work cut out for us as we as we think about <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4526.308s">how</a> to critically evaluate things that are quantifiable and things that are not quantifiable and be able to prioritize across that set of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4538.752s">And</a> then I think the other comment that I heard, which I think is important is, you know, we haven't ever had meetings like this, you know, pre a year ago, and that Zoom has really enabled us in a different way than we were able to take advantage of before. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4556.739s">And,</a> you know, certainly when you talk about the number of working parents, whether they're on the call tonight, or they come to our meetings, that that was a pretty important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4567.345s">And</a> then I think that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4570.968s">I</a> think that those were like the biggest things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4573.31s">Did</a> I miss anything, Mayor?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4639.524s">We</a> actually didn't get that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4640.985s">We</a> ran out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4642.685s">But</a> the thing that immediately sort of came to my mind is this notion of, you know, with MCAS, you can measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4653.788s">You</a> have numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4655.308s">It's</a> really easy to prioritize things that get tied to numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4662.44s">And</a> in contrast, something like the fine arts that don't attach themselves to an MCAS score so directly and like really figuring out how do you weigh the balance of math and fine arts is I think an example that sort of my wheels started turning as we were talking about it.<h2><a href="../2021-03-24_s_2IiM5UIbM/2021-03-24_s_2IiM5UIbM.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting March 24, 2021</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1951.637s">So</a> I had a couple of tactical thoughts and maybe some questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1957.802s">So</a> it strikes me that our student liaison always starts with us pretty late in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1966.809s">So</a> the student does not typically join us until <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1972.424s">November-ish,</a> if I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1976.026s">And</a> I think perhaps we need to think about the timing of that so that we can make sure that you get the joy of a full year of service with us when you come on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1992.595s">So</a> I think that goes back to, we should be holding elections according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=1999.349s">that</a> you know those obviously like mechanically would need to happen very early in the year maybe the prior year I don't know so that you can join us at the beginning of the school year to have that sort of full that kind of full experience because there are things that move from <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2018.731s">Meeting</a> to meeting in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2020.353s">So</a> I think that's sort of one thing that is on my mind is, how do we make sure that you all whoever the representative is is into the fold much sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2029.526s">I</a> also would like to see us when we call the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2036.73s">add</a> you to the role so that we know who's there, we know who to be looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2044.356s">It</a> isn't usually a problem in chambers because there's like nobody there, but when you add Zoom and there's hundreds of people, it can be challenging, but I would want to make sure that we call the role, we log you in as here or not here, no judgment because <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2062.07s">You</a> know you are students first, but whoever is there we know and we can make you a co host so that we can see you on the front of the screen instead of like hunting for your reactions and things like that like when I you know when I am on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2078.017s">I</a> like to see all of my colleagues, I want to see their reactions, just like I would in person and I certainly would want to see yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2086.365s">And</a> I don't, I don't believe there's anything under the law that would preclude us from calling your names in the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2093.051s">Another</a> thought that I had as we were talking is, is there a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2100.441s">call</a> you to vote in a non-binding way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2104.282s">And</a> I think the question and maybe the takeaway for the two of you is, if we were to do that, would you want us to call you first or last? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2116.424s">And</a> I would be perfectly fine if you didn't wanna answer that question right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2123.186s">Because</a> the elected official, the elected members of the school committee by the city of Medford do have to cast the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2130.947s">But</a> when it's a nice vote, it's not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2134.989s">It</a> doesn't matter if you vote first or last, but you may wanna think about some of the more contentious votes that we take and sort of the role and the voice you might wanna play. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2143.853s">And</a> perhaps we can investigate calling you as a part of the role, even though your vote is not a binding factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2154.017s">The</a> other thing that we have had on our agenda on this committee for a while <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2157.918s">is</a> to redesign the agenda itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2163.903s">And</a> perhaps in that the redesign of the agenda, there needs to be a report from our student liaison, just the same way we have a report from our secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2173.67s">And</a> then sort of my final thought as it's been like rattling around in my head is, are students allowed to submit resolutions the same way that voting members of the school committee are under the law? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2187.519s">And</a> if you are allowed to do that, are you aware that you're allowed to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2192.361s">What</a> does that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2193.961s">And</a> what would our rules be around that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=2196.462s">So</a> those are some things that, as I've been listening to the conversation, have been sort of rolling around in my head.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=3645.131s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_2IiM5UIbM&t=3647.132s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-03-22_x6UMczRpx7Y/2021-03-22_x6UMczRpx7Y.html">Committee of the Whole Meeting - CIP</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1633.244s">So</a> I'm looking at the capital plan from back in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1638.227s">In</a> the first year of this capital plan, as it was defined, we were slated to install two new air compressors at the Brooks, five at the Columbus, two at the Roberts, and four at the McGlynn Complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1654.05s">Do</a> we know if those air compressors were installed in 2019 or if they weren't? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1660.891s">They</a> were?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1680.528s">Repaired</a> or replaced, because I think those are two totally different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1686.09s">Right?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1722.916s">And</a> how many air compressors does each building have? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1728.46s">Do</a> we know? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1729.541s">And</a> how many of them are new and how many of them are X years old?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1739.829s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1740.39s">And</a> I guess I'm asking because if we like, <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1743.875s">I</a> guess it stands to reason right if the Columbus needed five new air compressors there's at least five on a given building. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1750.46s">But</a> probably more and we've replaced in some buildings we replaced only two and at the Columbus we replaced five we replaced Fort McGlynn which I would assume has more air compressors so when we and none at the Andrews so. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1765.216s">I</a> think my question is, how many does each building have? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1768.557s">How</a> old are they and how long can we reasonably expect them to last or be repairable? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1773.918s">Are</a> we doing the proper preventive maintenance to allow them to reach their full life? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1778.778s">Or</a> have we ignored them like some of the other issues that we've had in the last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1783.139s">And</a> what does that mean in terms of what we need to plan to spend this year, next year, the year after in terms of capital funds to replace <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1794.109s">air</a> compressors in the buildings that actually have functioning air systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1798.814s">I</a> have information there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1979.876s">Yeah,</a> and I think in past committees, there's been explicit asks for such a detail of the infrastructure and systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1990.173s">I</a> think that would be really useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1993.534s">The</a> other thing that I see on this in 2019 is spending $500,000 to replace the fire alarm ceiling system at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2002.638s">I</a> don't know if that was ever completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2005.319s">Does</a> anybody know?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2027.47s">Are</a> you jumping in to respond to my question or?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2171.666s">Well,</a> I don't want to just hear John talk about numbers and things and how old they might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2176.849s">I</a> want there to be an actual documented inventory <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2182.61s">of</a> the equipment for which we are responsible as the school committee to maintain and replace so that we can have a real capital plan that lays out the real things that are needed for school buildings to work and run. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2197.242s">So</a> I frankly don't think it's enough for John to come and tell us about three air compressors that might need to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2207.375s">I</a> think this warrants and deserves a little bit more attention, and I think if it's gonna take some time to do that, I think all the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2216.037s">But</a> overall, this plan, and I remember the meeting well, we talked about, the committee, I was not on it at the time, talked about, for example, having multiple end of life roofs to contend with, and they were put on this capital plan as placeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2232.12s">Now,</a> I did not see them and the consultants from the city's capital plan confirmed that end-of-life groups were not part of the capital plan as it related to what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2243.645s">So</a> to me, there's a huge gap between what this plan written in 2019, which was a first step and better than the plan that didn't exist on paper before, and a plan on the city side, which is not comprehensive of all that the schools need. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2265.326s">there</a> is a gap there that we have to fill and it's this committee's responsibility to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2269.449s">So</a> I wanna make sure that is prioritized and completed so that there can be no mistake about the things that our schools need to be functioning properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2277.655s">And</a> if that takes a little bit more time, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2283.139s">Frankly,</a> a lot of the things on this list that I'm looking at, I would question significantly because they all revolve around incremental <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2293.385s">spent</a> relatively incremental spend in a building that I don't know that we've determined is viable as an ongoing concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2301.513s">So</a> you know before we're going to spend $900,000 renovating the library we should probably decide if we're going to knock it down at some point soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2309.66s">And</a> so to me that's <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2312.603s">sort</a> of back to the value of the vision committee and understanding what all the options are, but allowing and us all individually being open to the notion that the most expeditious and cost-effective way for us to do right by Medford High School may or may not be the thing that's in our brain as the best option. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2332.009s">And</a> we have to be committed to doing that work before I can really endorse <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2338.511s">you</a> know, any of the spending that's on this list for the high school complex, unless it really has to do with immediate need for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2344.853s">So</a> frankly, internet infrastructure is on my mind is something that is critically important for the high school building and is not going perfectly just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2354.116s">So,</a> but even, you know, discussions of the bathrooms, I have huge reservations spending what could be millions of dollars on bathrooms with no overall plan for that building.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2369.065s">Mr.</a> Murphy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2522.96s">And</a> do you anticipate in order to build that, Mr. Murphy, that you will need funds from the school committee to allow you to work with people with expertise on these various things? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2537.046s">Like,</a> do you need funding to be able to even create that <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2542.647s">that</a> base plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2543.828s">Or</a> is that something that you have the skillset to do in-house?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2631.254s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2632.334s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2632.554s">And</a> I think if that requirement was for the school committee to allocate funds to allow you to seek the expertise that you need in certain areas, I would certainly be amenable to some of the capital funds going to support those efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2649.7s">Because</a> I, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2651.488s">I</a> completely appreciate that John and his team can't be experts in every last thing about a building because it requires so many different expertises. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2661.952s">Like,</a> is the roof too old to survive? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2664.413s">And</a> has the air compressor been properly serviced? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2667.734s">Are</a> two complete, you know, very, very different questions with different expertises required to know how to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2762.791s">And</a> I think establishing that baseline plan is a good way to have a detailed capital planning discussion on an annualized basis that is grounded in the facts and the realities and all the things that change one year to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2776.338s">So</a> just because you didn't think an air compressor was going to give out in August doesn't mean it doesn't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2783.863s">And</a> so you have to <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2785.077s">make</a> those adjustments as they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2786.718s">So</a> I do think that would be inordinately helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2790.639s">I</a> think it would allow us to have a much more robust capital plan on behalf of all of our buildings, as well as start to make some real decisions about what we can and cannot do with the buildings that we have among us.<h2><a href="../2021-03-22_zdRFAfm1Rlg/2021-03-22_zdRFAfm1Rlg.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5024.703s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5025.505s">I</a> just wanna... <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5027.224s">make</a> sure that you are aware, Superintendent, that over the last couple of days, I know I have received reports, other members of the school committee may have as well, that this individualized choice is sort of turning into a peer pressure situation of its own amongst parents, particularly in the remote classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5049.438s">There</a> are <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5050.258s">families</a> out there that are really concerned that want to stay remote and do feel that they are being pressured by other members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5057.983s">So</a> I don't know how you deal with that, but I guess I would just ask that you take special care to ask the families who indicate that they're <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5071.521s">willing</a> or that they want to or that they need to just exactly what is driving their decision so that we can be sure we're doing right by those children and not that their parents feel that they are being pressured <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5090.307s">by</a> anybody, and I don't at all think that the administration is doing this, but it is happening in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5096.112s">I've</a> heard about it on multiple occasions at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5099.114s">And</a> I just wanna be unequivocally clear that it's my position that there's really no circumstance where this is best for kids who choose to stay remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5109.402s">Consistency</a> for them in April is that they get to keep their teacher because they're not making a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5116.367s">if</a> there are children out there who are making a change because that is what they want to do, we've clearly laid out, thank you very much for that, the stipulations of what that change could mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5128.033s">And</a> I would ask that you exhaust every and all options before you would consider changing the teacher in April of even one remote student at the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5140.18s">I</a> just, I can't, I can't, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5144.475s">I</a> can't fathom how we can talk about consistency and then involuntarily change a student's teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5152.458s">Having</a> said that, I appreciate the operational conundrum and dilemma that this causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5159.881s">And</a> if you need to call an emergency meeting because you need funding allocations or something to make something different work, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5166.767s">so</a> that we can preserve consistency and equity for the remote students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5171.96s">I</a> will make myself available any time of the day or night to do so.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8048.732s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8051.354s">How</a> much money is the city of Medford slated to get through the Federal Stimulus Act?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8062.564s">And</a> what is the term that it has to be spent over? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8069.266s">It's</a> several years, is that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8081.708s">And</a> then the ESSER money that will come directly to the schools, what is that amount?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8099.776s">And</a> are they 2025 end date as well, or do we not know?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8118.808s">And</a> I'm sorry, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8119.829s">Did</a> you say when you expected to have that information?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8162.863s">Great,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10465.044s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10682.654s">Mayor,</a> we have somebody with their hand in the air.<h2><a href="../2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w/2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w.html">Committee of the Whole - Columbus School Naming Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3579.963s">member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3583.184s">Just</a> a couple thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3584.845s">I</a> feel like somebody needs to build this as we are talking so that at the end it can be read in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3591.227s">Um</a> and I don't know if Susie is able to do that or prepared to do that in a Google Doc. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3598.689s">If</a> she's not, I'm happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3601.21s">Um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3603.441s">I</a> am fine with the two applications being severed, but I am not on board with any date delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3612.646s">So</a> I do not, I'm not on board with date delays and I would be happy to lend my assistance to create the Google form if that's what it takes to get the forms out the door by Friday.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3729.178s">Yeah,</a> so superintendent I'm fine with Monday, provided that it doesn't change the next date, the next day, it has to stay in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3737.271s">So</a> I'm not I am I am willing to go along for a change that makes the superintendent's life easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3744.842s">but</a> I am not willing to slide the date, slide the date, slide the date, slide the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3749.545s">So</a> I'm just saying that right now, as long as we feel like that's adequate time for people to apply with that shift of the first deadline from Friday to Monday, I am absolutely fine with that, but I am not on board for a slow shift of all of these dates.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3778.559s">Thank</a> you, Debra Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3780.622s">So,</a> Mayor, are you <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3783.001s">do</a> you want me to do this or are you going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3785.443s">I</a> just, we probably can't both do it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6232.034s">So</a> can I just step back and tell you what we have accomplished so far before we go forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6240.377s">I</a> think you should screen share it so we could all just take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6242.658s">I'm</a> happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6243.438s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6244.458s">I</a> just want to point out this is a five-page resolution and we have addressed one paragraph of the five-page resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6251.741s">So</a> cover page one, at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6257.679s">Nope,</a> not even. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6258.74s">We're</a> sort of in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6263.764s">So</a> this started from Paulette's and I will cobble them together as we talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6269.449s">But</a> what we have covered is the application committee, the advisory committee application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6274.833s">I</a> added a bullet here that says the superintendent will create a form no later than Monday, March 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6281.559s">The</a> form will be translated in a manner consistent with all district communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6286.223s">The</a> availability is listed already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6289.164s">I</a> made this update to clarify when we ask, which was already on the form, if you're a member of the Columbus School community, if so, how and when, student, family, staff, and in what year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6306.732s">The</a> demographics information, I added a clause that said will be collected but separated from the main body of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6314.157s">I</a> am not in favor of removing sexual orientation because again, the goal of collecting these demographics is to understand who we are reaching and who we are not reaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6323.784s">And</a> that is a common best practice question that is put in surveys all the time now because <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6333.05s">we</a> want to know that we are reaching all members of our community and they are an important portion of the community.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6402.57s">They</a> are all optional though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6405.112s">You're</a> not obligated to answer any of the demographic questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6759.186s">So</a> Mayor, I put all the timelines in a separate section. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6764.091s">So</a> just because the timelines were sort of commingled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6767.653s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6768.634s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6769.295s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6770.055s">We'll</a> do that separately.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7211.208s">Mayor,</a> I can share my screen for the... Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7216.87s">For</a> this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7219.057s">which</a> is I've titled Application Timelines and Submission Guidelines for Advisory Committee and Name Suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7225.041s">So</a> the application form and suggestion form will be posted and communicated out through usual mechanisms the district uses, including translations to prominent languages on Monday, March 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7237.091s">And</a> again, on Monday, March 22nd, the application and submission period will open Monday, March 15th and close on Friday, April 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7246.698s">at</a> 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7247.839s">A</a> paper version of both applications will be created by the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7251.763s">Residents</a> may request a paper version by contacting the superintendent's office at this phone number.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9195.817s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9201.021s">Can</a> I make a suggestion that we complete a round of public comment, we then close public comment so that we can actually work through this document with the comments of the public in mind, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9216.177s">we</a> can open for a brief, maybe shorter timeline, public comment when the document is completed, so that we can hear from everybody, we can use that information to react and complete the work of this meeting, and then we can take public comment again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9235.625s">But</a> this is disrupt, this back and forth, we're not making our way through this document in a productive way, so I'd like to see us try to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9245.359s">be</a> more productive as we get through this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9248.301s">Is</a> that an amendment to the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9250.763s">If</a> you would like it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9252.764s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9254.525s">Then</a> you have a second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9266.192s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9267.253s">So</a> the motion is to take a round of public comment starting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9273.438s">Everybody</a> gets three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9274.919s">Two</a> minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9275.219s">And</a> then we close public comment and we work through the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9280.243s">When</a> we are done, we can take another round of public comment, but we will not take public comment during the working through of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9290.872s">We</a> are not making forward progress.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11884.142s">I</a> can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11888.325s">Yeah,</a> I would just ask that member Van der Kloot describe her intent and then member Rousseau do the same thing because we need to understand the intent so that we can then understand the details of the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11907.749s">And</a> we have not had an opportunity to talk about this as a group until now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11912.31s">So</a> can we just start with,
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12192.178s">Can</a> we hear from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12193.14s">Kaye</a> before I speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12196.226s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12452.085s">Are</a> you- Member Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12456.77s">As</a> I was sort of listening and trying to reconcile all of these pieces around the Columbus School's participation, I was sort of thinking through a model where we would let Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12470.256s">Kay</a> move through a process within her building and put forward some number of, we can just call them finalists for the moment, to say that the Columbus School is going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12488.411s">work</a> within their building and recommend some number of finalists, like call it four. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12493.072s">And</a> then that the larger advisory committee is, in addition to those four, going to add six more finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12501.474s">So</a> perhaps part of the process is getting from the list of potentially thousands, if we're going down this road of passing everything off to the subcommittee, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12512.02s">maybe</a> their first step is to get to a culled list of finalists before they do the rest of their work, where the finalist list can be published to the community, there can be some excitement about it, but that Miss Kay and the Columbus building could <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12534.685s">seed</a> some number of finalist choices to that to that sort of population. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12540.513s">So</a> that was something I was thinking about, I guess for me, knowing how busy the end of the year is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12549.545s">The</a> school building and the calendar and the schedule sort of operates differently than what I expect the rest of the advisory committee to operate like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12560.036s">And</a> there may be more flexibility for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12562.918s">Kay</a> if we give her the latitude to operate in the confines of the school schedule, which is going to be completely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12572.356s">then</a> how the advisory committee is going to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12575.039s">So</a> I want to make sure that we are not losing the Columbus's participation due to like schedule issues, which I think is a real possibility if we just ask teachers to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12592.194s">participate</a> in the advisory committee, which is just going to operate on a completely different schedule than their use than they operate on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12598.238s">So</a> I feel like it could be a prohibitive amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12602.181s">If</a> you're a teacher, you're going back to school, you're trying to get your vaccine, you're trying to get MCAS off the ground, you're trying to do the end of the year stuff like to ask them also to meet 567 some number of times with an advisory committee that <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12616.91s">is</a> largely going to be made up of people with jobs elsewhere who aren't going to be able to meet at 2.30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and it's going to be nights and weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12628.698s">I</a> think there may be some value, but I will defer to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12631.44s">Kay</a> of putting a structure in place that gives her some autonomy to recommend finalists and makes that a feature of the advisory committee that the very first step is a list of finalists.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12937.318s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure that we don't make it so hard for the Columbus teachers and community to participate in the advisory committee that they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12949.872s">And</a> then we have sort of left that voice out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12953.191s">Yeah,</a> so that I think, Dr. Kaye, if you feel like there will be volunteers and excitement to do this work, I am totally comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12964.161s">I</a> just don't want it ever to be said that this committee did not value the input and thought leadership of the community at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12976.232s">So</a> I just wanna make sure you're comfortable that this will work for you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13163.89s">I</a> think when I read this what I liked about it was that we are like again under the umbrella of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13174.169s">making</a> sure our Columbus school community is involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13177.472s">I</a> do, like, I think we shouldn't shy away from having additional members of the high school on the committee, but I would like to see us ensure that there is a member of the Columbus community that is currently in high school that can participate in this.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13438.94s">Elsewhere</a> in this document, we talk about all the meetings being posted via compliance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13448.001s">there</a> would, if that carries, there would be no concern about that discussion happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13454.383s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14168.333s">Um</a> I do think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14181.027s">totally</a> torpedo this process, because that will be the very definition of not bringing people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14190.072s">So</a> we need to take active measure to ensure that we are putting people on the committee who not only want to do the work, but are committed to moving the school community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14212.366s">I</a> do believe that we need to select people to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14220.873s">I</a> don't think we can leave that to chance because the lottery, literally you can be completely against the name change and submit an application, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14235.859s">But</a> if the lottery produces an entire group of people who are there to oppose the name change, the committee will not be able to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14245.005s">And</a> that is not actually helping us accomplish the work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14249.487s">So</a> I have major hesitations about the lottery, but I don't mind the notion of a small number of people <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14262.601s">being</a> picked by lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14263.742s">I</a> would be fine with three, but I also think the committee needs to each pick two because we have put all of the work of reviewing and vetting names on the committee and it will be a considerable amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14283.454s">So</a> I think the committee should <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14286.457s">I</a> think the school committee should each select two, and I think there should be three additional names pulled via lottery.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14464.722s">And</a> we can just remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14466.243s">It's</a> fine.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14493.43s">Aren't</a> we all capable of looking out for that if that is important to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14499.202s">I</a> am.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14973.656s">Member</a> Graham has had her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14975.217s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14976.157s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14978.818s">I</a> am completely opposed to giving this responsibility to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14983.38s">I</a> think one thing that we have heard <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14987.677s">from</a> everybody, no matter what their perspective on the renaming of the Columbus school is, is that the administration has a very big task ahead of them to get kids back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15000.005s">And</a> this was our decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15003.832s">Six</a> out of the seven of us said yes to this vote in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15008.954s">We</a> need to own the consequences of that decision, and we need to own the completion of the task. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15016.976s">And</a> pushing the dirty work onto the administration because it's uncomfortable is not what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15025.578s">We</a> made a decision <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15027.839s">and</a> it's up to us to carry that decision forward, not to make other people do the work that we don't wanna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15034.545s">So</a> I'm completely opposed and it has nothing to do with trust before anybody goes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15040.009s">It</a> has nothing to do with trusting the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15043.392s">It</a> has nothing to do with trusting the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15045.694s">It</a> has to do with our responsibility and ownership as this school committee for this decision.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15450.23s">Didn't</a> we have a motion that we were going to take public comment, then we were going to finish the document, and then we were going to take public comment again? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15458.317s">Didn't</a> we pass that as a motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17635.768s">The</a> good thing they work all night, those tooth fairies.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17827.079s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17829.282s">We</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17840.256s">The</a> number of people has to be commiserate with, I know, but the number of people has to be commiserate with the work that has to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17848.281s">So</a> we can have a small committee if we are gonna limit the universe of what we're asking them to consider, but we're asking them to do a tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17860.309s">We're</a> not, this is a volunteer committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17863.571s">Like</a> there's just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17866.372s">we</a> need to be respectful of the work that we're asking people to do and make sure that it's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17872.598s">So</a> that is, I would love for us to have a smaller committee, but I don't think that makes any sense if we are gonna dump hundreds and hundreds of suggestions on their lap. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17886.687s">Because</a> I think what I want is for them to vet through these suggestions and remove the Schoolie McSchoolface suggestions and all the other things that are non-contenders off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17900.541s">But</a> I think people are going to put forward names that are not household names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17905.526s">And</a> somebody is going to have to vet through <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17908.929s">that</a> information, it's a lot of work, potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17911.931s">I</a> mean, we just don't know how much work it is, but I think we have to be prepared for the fact it's a lot of work.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18381.351s">If</a> we do up to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18383.273s">And</a> MHS student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18385.234s">Three,</a> Kathy K and MHS student is five. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18388.953s">So</a> I think it's 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18391.474s">This</a> math works out to 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18392.515s">So</a> 5 plus 14 plus 3 is 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18394.176s">Wait,</a> so 5 plus 14 is 19, sorry, plus 3 is 21, plus a chair is 22, and an ex officio.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18419.6s">So</a> let's talk, it's 23 plus an ex-officio.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18429.143s">So</a> 23 voting members and one ex-officio member.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18659.201s">So</a> are we saying that we will collectively select the chair?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18685.757s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18688.579s">I</a> think it would need to be in excess, otherwise you'd have an even number of people.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18719.731s">So</a> are we saying one of the mayor's appointments will serve as the chair?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18784.474s">And</a> I think the other challenge there is the open meeting law requirement and being able to adhere to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18794.09s">because</a> if the advisory committee doesn't adhere to the open meeting law, that will be a problem for this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18805.838s">So</a> we need to take measures to ensure that there is compliance with the open meeting law.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19110.571s">We'll</a> add that in at the end.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19112.632s">Let's</a> see, five, six. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19115.472s">Are</a> there any other changes to one through six here?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19280.524s">Okay,</a> the work of the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19283.705s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19294.878s">at</a> our committee of the whole, we will also put forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19630.653s">I</a> actually loved the suggestion of us narrowing down to two and then asking the students of the Columbus to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19646.721s">I</a> loved that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19650.959s">I</a> think it's could be a really powerful lesson for the students, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19659.406s">So</a> they talk about voting during election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19663.109s">This</a> is a chance for them to vote on something more than like what their favorite cookie is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19668.733s">Like</a> this is a chance for them to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19673.257s">we</a> could be presented with three options and we could collectively narrow to two and then let the school vote later that week.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20077.842s">Mayor?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20079.503s">Can</a> we revise this to say they will hold at least one public hearing or issue one public survey to provide them some options? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20089.571s">I</a> am very sensitive to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20093.499s">a</a> group of volunteers coming forward to do this work and being treated badly because of the work they're trying to do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20851.597s">Member</a> Graham?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20855.731s">The</a> resolution that we passed did say that effective July 1st, the school no longer be named the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20861.737s">So</a> I am amenable to giving the committee at their request time into the end of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20869.084s">And</a> if we're going to extend that, we need to have an answer for what will we call the school between those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20877.051s">I</a> feel like South Medford Elementary School is a fine interim, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20881.371s">name,</a> but I am a hard no on a six-month extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20885.276s">So</a> I'm a no, absolutely not.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21612.009s">Member</a> Grim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21614.577s">I</a> think to Member Mustone's point, the value of identifying what happens in the interim is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21626.961s">If</a> for no other reason than to try to limit the hostile environment that could be created for the advisory work who will be in the thick of doing their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21641.892s">So</a> I feel like it would be fine to just clearly state that if this happens, the school committee will choose a temporary name for the school effective July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21656.023s">I</a> think that we don't, if it were me, I would be happy to make that decision now because if we don't, we are absolutely signing up for another five hour meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21669.671s">which</a> I'm perfectly happy to do but that five-hour meeting is going to happen in front of the advisory committee that is in the middle of doing this work and it's going to create a hostile environment and I would like us to try to avoid making this process hostile for the people volunteering to do this hard work on our behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21690.629s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21691.696s">At</a> minimum, I think we should just clearly state that the school committee will make that decision if it becomes necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21699.7s">Ideally,</a> we would just decide it so that we can move forward, but I am open to either suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21707.825s">I'm</a> just not open to not saying anything in this particular instance, because I think it just sets us up for more churn and we need less churn.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21884.865s">I</a> think we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21886.246s">I</a> think we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21887.487s">There</a> has to be a finite endpoint <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21891.474s">of</a> what this committee is being charged to do and how we will respond if that does not happen.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21908.505s">They</a> come back and they say we're a hung jury, sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21922.299s">I</a> think that is exceedingly reasonable and I don't think it's likely to happen, but here we are at midnight talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21934.406s">trying</a> to form this committee because we have spent the entire evening talking about the thing we decided back in June of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21943.229s">So</a> I don't think we can rule out that it's a possibility, and I want there to be a clear path. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21952.165s">that</a> says what happens in the off chance that that occurs?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22073.9s">I</a> completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22074.84s">I</a> completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22076.16s">But</a> there has to be a clear answer to what if the advisory committee just cannot fulfill the obligations that we've asked them to fulfill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22090.379s">Because</a> what we can't do is start back here in July.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22098.141s">But</a> we have to, I feel like at that point, we have to be talking about names instead of advisory committees and how we will proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22113.224s">Like,</a> I think the how we will proceed question just has to be answered by us tonight.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22323.288s">Page</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22324.749s">So</a> is this what we want?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22478.24s">Oh,</a> so I think we just leave it like this and roll the dice.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22485.086s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22488.328s">Any</a> changes to this section? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22491.651s">Just</a> the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22492.812s">The</a> date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22494.273s">What</a> is wrong with the date? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22496.92s">they're</a> gonna do their work by the 24th, and we're gonna do that by the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22504.468s">It's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22505.649s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22532.84s">Just</a> give me a second to... Okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22597.484s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22598.125s">There's</a> something funny going on with the formatting, so I'm just going to fix it while you talk, Paulette.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22689.406s">And</a> like that, Paulette? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22693.447s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22697.687s">And</a> member Rousseau, was there other stuff in your?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23664.403s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-03-10_ncGsNyIdjFk/2021-03-10_ncGsNyIdjFk.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=539.303s">Yeah,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=540.623s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=542.364s">I</a> was just curious whether the district had a reaction to the draft guidelines and whether the district has submitted a public comment about the guidelines or sort of what your thinking is about what the guidelines are saying versus what you, <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=562.295s">would</a> have expected them to say or would desire them to say?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1274.035s">I</a> think I remember when we were looking at the budget last year, there was an ask from the elementary school principals around Zaner Blosser and an expansion of <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1285.76s">material</a> that my recall is did not get funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1290.946s">Is</a> that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1292.828s">Or</a> I can't I'm trying to like recall off the top of my head the context, but I thought it was like an expansion to grade four, perhaps or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1301.597s">So</a> can you shed any light on that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1419.428s">Paulette?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1420.268s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1420.508s">I</a> think there's a hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1423.569s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1423.789s">Hayes?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3510.565s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3511.025s">I</a> actually have several questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3515.108s">When</a> you were talking about the secondary level, you said something to the effect of not having enough <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3528.268s">resources</a> and I use that term broadly to do what we would have needed to do at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3539.311s">And</a> I don't, I would like to encourage you to be unapologetically clear about what you need from the committee and the city <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3558.238s">in</a> this upcoming budget, don't be unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3565.282s">If</a> you need three teachers, please tell us that you need three teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3570.585s">If</a> you need resources, like I remember distinctly that we hacked away a lot of online resources when we were making budget cuts last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3580.41s">And</a> I remember feeling like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3584.935s">the</a> people telling us they didn't need those things felt pretty uncomfortable because they know they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3589.679s">So</a> I say all of this to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3594.161s">We</a> need you to tell us what you need to make sure that we don't have generations full of children who struggle to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3602.464s">So</a> whatever it is that you need, I wanna encourage you to be completely clear and like unabashedly transparent about what those things are so that we can never come back to you and say, you didn't tell us that you needed something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3623.313s">I</a> want the city to and the school committee to make those prioritization decisions so that it's clear who is who is <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3637.622s">outlining</a> what is needed and who is and isn't able to provide those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3642.027s">So</a> if that's resources at the middle school, if that's an assessment tool, if that's $40,000 for 2,000 kids, that is just not a lot of money in my mind in terms of what <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3655.217s">those</a> tools can do if they are valuable and effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3659.98s">I'm</a> not afraid to tell the city that we need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3663.181s">And</a> I would think that my colleagues would generally feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3667.603s">So</a> please be clear and transparent about that with us so that we can advocate for the students because that's why we all do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3677.488s">So</a> definitely tell us what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3683.681s">Yep,</a> I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3685.863s">And</a> then I guess the other question that I had, I definitely sort of understand and appreciate the the stacking and the like the transition that has to happen to roll out new curricula and that you at the elementary school level in particular can't do that across multiple subject matters in the same year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3708.734s">But</a> I would ask and challenge you all to think about whether there's a way to accelerate the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3718.282s">Perhaps</a> the math committee has a front runner, and if they're being honest, they know who they're going to pick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3726.392s">And</a> maybe we just have to roll with that to expedite the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3731.774s">If</a> it means we need to find a way to negotiate more professional development time, please tell us that too, so that if there is any way possible <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3743.59s">We</a> can be in a position where we are rolling out a new literacy program before 2023 that we can do that like the kids who are going to be missed in the right now are also the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3759.364s">most</a> dramatically impacted by the pandemic at that very young reader level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3765.148s">So</a> between now and 2023 is like recovery time for all the things that they have missed and we've not been able to accomplish with them because of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3777.456s">If</a> we wait till 2023 to start using a curriculum that is suitable to our needs, like it's just gonna exacerbate that problem <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3788.677s">even</a> more so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3789.798s">So</a> if there's any creative out-of-the-box way for us to do all of this just a little bit faster, I think the kids, the littles in particular who are gonna be passed by while we wait for Medford to, and through no fault of really anybody on this phone call, to put in place curricula that are sound and evidence-based <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3818.375s">and</a> competitive, I guess I'll say, across all subject matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3824.298s">It</a> is a huge lift what you all are doing at the elementary school level to really write the curriculum across lots of different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3835.485s">In</a> regular times, this probably couldn't be moving fast enough for some, but the literacy piece of this is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3846.612s">that</a> I am really concerned about the impacts of the kids who we are going to leave behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3852.093s">So</a> just think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3853.933s">And</a> if there are ways the committee needs to prioritize and support those activities, I am all ears.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3901.652s">And</a> I think I just heard that there was some good news from Washington on the relief bill today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3907.077s">So</a> get out your wish lists.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4284.81s">Any</a> other questions, Jenny? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4289.192s">Um,</a> that actually sorry, I forgot to ask this earlier because I was that was on my mind as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4295.876s">But</a> when we talk about the work that you're doing, it's certainly as you mentioned, like doing a doing a focused job in tier one should help us avoid, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4310.958s">kids</a> having to move through to tier two or even on to tier three, because we didn't do the right things for them sort of at those foundational like levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4320.503s">So</a> I guess there's sort of two thoughts that I have as it relates to that one is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4325.526s">We</a> did put on the list of standing reports for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4331.549s">a</a> request that when assessments are given, we receive the aggregated results in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4340.754s">And</a> I know we didn't get that at all this year, but I think it is important for the committee to have a pulse of like, where are those assessments coming in on any given assessment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4353.1s">I</a> think you do three assessments a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4356.221s">So</a> I would want to be able to, I just wanted to bring that to your attention so that it's clear that that is on the list of approved reports, like under the reporting policy that we just passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4367.585s">And</a> if there's an opportunity, I don't know when the right time is to catch the committee up on those reports for this year, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4375.228s">But</a> then- Okay, and I worked really closely with, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4379.19s">Oh,</a> sorry, go ahead.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4395.125s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4395.446s">And</a> then I guess, Superintendent, the other thing that comes to mind is if we fixed our tier one opportunity tomorrow, there's still a pipeline of kids that <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4410.962s">that</a> doesn't help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4412.083s">So,</a> you know, Joan, I know you're on the phone, but I think the other question that lots of parents have, particularly those who are very vocal about the struggles their kids have had is like, they're still advocating and fighting for those things to happen because they're the right things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4428.009s">But</a> by and large, like those opportunities have, are not gonna impact or affect their children, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4434.772s">So</a> where their children are sort of squarely onto <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4437.813s">meeting</a> additional intervention and I know that's sort of part of not that's not like a tier one curriculum item but I would like to know sort of what we need to be planning for <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4454.014s">As</a> we think about tier two and tier three intervention around literacy in the upcoming years, you know, just as a sort of a general rule, but also sort of at the hands of the pandemic what what do we need to be thinking and planning for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4469.716s">to</a> address any sort of you know learning loss that's really happening in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4475.521s">So</a> I don't know if that's like another curriculum subcommittee meeting or if that is something you all can address during the budget but I feel like the answer is probably like if there's both sides of that coin but I just want to make sure that we are planning for those kids who these these changes at the at the early elementary level that it's not going to <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4497.97s">to</a> impact them so that we can get them on a path that is more stable for them as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4599.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4601.36s">Jenny,</a> could you call the roll, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4603.141s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4603.621s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4604.341s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4604.882s">Member</a> Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4605.742s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4606.747s">member</a> of Vandercliff? <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4607.868s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc/2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6059.364s">Hi,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6060.825s">So</a> we met on the 2nd of March, and the topics that we covered were really around infusing some community engagement into the work that the district has been doing to craft a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6075.631s">We</a> reviewed a plan and some options to host <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6082.614s">Roundtables</a> in early April, and we wanna target the week of April 5th, and we would be hosting two roundtables, and the superintendent will circulate information about the details of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6099.98s">But</a> the roundtables would operate much like the roundtables we did back last spring, where we were talking about the reopening of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6110.983s">and</a> but would be focused on questions around the vision of where and the direction of the district so that that community input could be pulled into the strategic planning work that is already underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6128.231s">So</a> we talked about having two 90 minute sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6131.973s">One</a> would start at five and one would start at 630 just to provide some small timing shifts for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6139.496s">There'll</a> be breakout rooms at each of the roundtable that will sort of operate identically and focus on the different levels and classifications of folks who may be interested in joining and have something to say specific to elementary or middle school, high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6156.61s">We</a> talked about a breakout room for our special education families, and we also talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6167.196s">breakout</a> rooms for those who need translations much like we did in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6171.818s">In</a> thinking about all of that I would also suggest that we have one for teachers because they'll be critical to whatever strategic plans are put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6180.403s">So</a> at the meeting we talked about the sort of structure of the roundtables that would occur <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6187.586s">And</a> then we talked about a survey that the district would send out at the conclusion of the roundtable in late April so that we collect even yet more information from the families in the community about the strategic plan so that, you know, attendance at the meeting is not a requirement in order to provide input on <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6213.44s">the</a> overall information that we are looking to see as part of the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6221.042s">And</a> then from there, the administration will take all of that information and assimilate it with much of the work they have been doing and has been underway for over a year now, although halted by the pandemic, with still a goal that we will look at that strategic plan in detail in <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6239.186s">June</a> of this year so that we can begin to implement and execute against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6245.914s">So</a> again the roundtables would will be sort of penciled in for the week of April 6th, April 5th and the communication subcommittee meeting that's scheduled for that week will be canceled so that we can make space for the <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6261.652s">for</a> the roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6262.532s">And</a> then the survey draft will go out as somewhat contingent on some of the initial feedback from the roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6269.854s">And</a> then we'll go out around April vacation and have a couple of week turnaround time for folks to think and respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6277.456s">And</a> that's it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15381.92s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2021-03-02_OEoD865cVp0/2021-03-02_OEoD865cVp0.html">Communication Subcommittee meeting</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=334.083s">And</a> Member McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=335.484s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=336.845s">All</a> right, three absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=339.427s">Sorry,</a> three present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=343.555s">So</a> we talked about two things in our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=347.977s">One</a> is some round tables specifically geared toward the strategic plan itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=357.202s">So</a> separate and apart from the listening sessions that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=359.963s">And</a> then we also talked about a survey for those who can't participate in the Zoom session. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=367.727s">So</a> I actually did take <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=371.437s">a</a> crack at a draft of all of this and I'm gonna share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=384.525s">Can</a> you see my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=386.306s">Oh,</a> not yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=391.368s">How</a> about now? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=398.592s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=400.163s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=402.044s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=403.145s">So,</a> you know, what I did was just try to do some thinking around like what, you know, when we talk about a strategic plan and the kind of input we want from the community, how do we collect that input in a meaningful way? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=419.998s">And</a> I think one of the keys when you embark on strategic planning is that you sort of separate the like, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=429.489s">The</a> aspirational goal, or the what from the how, and I think when we, you know what I tried to do was say that, you know, we want to know about the what from the community so what. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=443.505s">are</a> we trying to accomplish with this strategic plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=447.086s">The</a> how is uniquely something that the people sort of in the inner workings of the organization have to ultimately come up with to align to that what. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=456.35s">So</a> I first did some digging and said, okay, when we talk about a strategic plan, it should always be anchored to our mission and our vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=468.293s">And</a> I went out on the website and there were two different mission statements on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=475.498s">One</a> sort of really short for MPS and then something longer for Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=487.526s">And</a> there was no like stated vision statement on the web. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=493.529s">So</a> I just say that to say that maybe those things exist and I just didn't put my hands on them on the website, but I'm just sharing with you what I did find. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=508.516s">Because</a> I think it's important as we talk about sort of a precursor to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=513.091s">sessions</a> that I was thinking about in terms of collecting community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=519.418s">And</a> I think, and there's one more bullet at the bottom of that, become contributing citizens in a global society. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=529.288s">So,</a> I think one question that I have is, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=536.73s">When</a> we talk about our vision, our mission, and our vision with Medford Public School, for Medford Public Schools in general, are these the right, like, what is the stated mission and vision of the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=552.119s">I</a> didn't, you know, I didn't, wasn't able to put my hands on it as I was planning, so I just tried to sort of navigate around that a little bit, but that's an obvious question that we'll have to answer before we <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=565.668s">go</a> into the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=567.729s">So</a> when I thought about the round table structure, what I tried to do was say, you know, what questions could we be asking the community to weigh in on that would allow us to sort of, us, you know, certainly the administration, but also the school committee as the policy makers and setters, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=593.77s">to</a> sort of understand what the community expects from this endeavor so that when we lay out our set of steps, when we aggregate the things that we're doing, we can be guided by that overall expectation from our mission and our vision statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=611.535s">And</a> often when I work with clients on strategic plans, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=616.602s">the</a> first thing that becomes clear is the vision and the mission are stale or dated or need some revision to sort of be relevant to what is going on in the current planning efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=631.848s">So</a> really the three questions that I thought we would ask during our round tables <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=641.377s">right</a> here, and we can talk about sort of the structure of the roundtables separately, but to me, I have three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=651.027s">So</a> does Medford Public Schools' current mission statement accurately describe <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=656.07s">the</a> long range goals you feel MPS should aspire to, why or not, why not, and what changes or suggestions do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=662.694s">So</a> that's question number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=665.395s">Question</a> number two, does MPS's current vision statement adequately describe what you feel MPS should achieve in the next X number of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=674.44s">And</a> I said X because, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=677.997s">a</a> strategic plan usually does lay out a path to a date in the future that says like, this is where we're going and this is when we will arrive at this new place in terms of the vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=692.509s">And</a> why or why not and what input changes or suggestions do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=696.672s">And</a> then third question, what key actions does MPS need to take to demonstrate forward progress toward our vision in <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=707.692s">x,</a> you know, in whatever year it is that the strategic plan is intended to take us to and in what timeframe would those steps have to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=717.058s">So</a> in trying to think about how to ask questions that can be meaningful input for all of us and also be questions that truly the public is positioned to weigh in on, that was sort of what I came up with as a starting point <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=735.315s">But</a> I was hoping we could talk about that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=737.416s">Overall,</a> my thought was an hour and a half roundtable would give us some time to bring people in, do some introduction, set the groundwork of what <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=750.853s">You</a> know, we are doing the strategic planning effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=753.014s">Here</a> is our current vision and mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=756.217s">Or</a> if there was something sort of new that we wanted to ask people to react to, we could do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=762.14s">Break</a> people out for about an hour, bring everybody back for a recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=767.484s">So</a> try to keep it pretty simple in structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=770.426s">I</a> know we now have breakout room capabilities we didn't have last year, which hopefully will be really, really helpful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=779.311s">And</a> then in terms of like the organization of the breakout rooms, sort of my thought was that we would break it somewhat by level, but also understand that there are special populations out there that may have their own sort of community around what they're wanting to see or aspire to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=806.068s">You</a> know, there may be a group of folks from a special education perspective or an English learner perspective and groups that can be supported by a translator. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=816.973s">But</a> fundamentally, I'll be asking these same three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=821.915s">So</a> I'll stop there and ask for thoughts, questions, comments, changes, feedback.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=878.705s">Yeah,</a> and those were sort of the groups that jumped out at me and I know back in the spring, we had questions around like, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=888.948s">We</a> had topical breakouts, but we also had people who had really different perspectives and experiences because of the levels their kids were at, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=898.457s">So</a> I actually went back and looked at how we did those. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=903.921s">And</a> there were sort of two factors that <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=909.623s">would</a> identify people. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=910.824s">One</a> was like this like leveling where you sort of sit in the world question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=917.71s">And</a> then the other was like the topical question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=920.092s">Like</a> when we were doing it last time, we were talking about athletics and extracurriculars and curriculum and instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=926.056s">And</a> like, so people were in lots of different categories for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=930.08s">So</a> I think this time we don't have two dimensions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=934.383s">So</a> that makes life a little bit easier because the same three questions <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=939.147s">apply</a> when you talk about the vision and the mission and like action steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=947.212s">no</a> matter what your subgroup is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=949.834s">So</a> I think that makes it a little bit less complicated and Zoom has gotten markedly better about how you identify people. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=958.46s">So</a> that is always helpful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=962.343s">So</a> that was my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=964.684s">I'm</a> not tied to that at all, but that was as I was thinking about trying to put together a straw man for us to react to sort of where my head went to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1083.972s">Yeah,</a> and I think that's actually a really good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1087.854s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1090.124s">when</a> you talk about a mission, I always think about that as like, the reason we get out of bed in the morning, that's the mission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1096.87s">So</a> the mission is something that sort of stands, ideally stands the test of time to some degree, although language, you know, always is worth looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1111.204s">But</a> the vision, to me, the vision is where you say like, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1115.143s">This</a> is, this is what it's going to look like at the end of this strategic plan, and, and I went back and looked at a couple of strategic plans that I had poked in on last year when we were going through it and I think, you know, Lexington's certainly does a really nice job of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1133.002s">wrapping</a> you in a warm hug when you read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1136.944s">Like</a> the mission is compelling, the vision just sort of jumps off the page at you, but the distinguishing characteristics, they actually sort of define in their strategic plan, which I think is important because many people think of those two things as exactly the same, like mission and vision are the same, or they talk about them in the same breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1159.095s">I</a> think when you talk about them differently, you can get sort of different things out of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1165.118s">But</a> to your point, we can and should expect that the community will come to us with the things on their mind, and they will put them in whatever bucket it goes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1179.326s">That</a> doesn't mean just because somebody wants our mission to be having a winning football team that that becomes the mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1188.904s">trying</a> to ask the question sort of in, what I envisioned is we would talk about these three things as a grounding statement at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1197.412s">And</a> then we would let the community tell us what they think about the answers to these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1204.078s">We</a> would capture the feedback and that would become input for not just the school committee, but also the administration as we talk about like, how do we unveil <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1215.634s">our</a> plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1216.234s">And</a> so we don't know, will the entire community be like, yeah, our mission statement is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1221.817s">Like</a> maybe I'm the only one that doesn't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1223.718s">Maybe</a> Melanie is the only one that doesn't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1227.1s">But</a> we, I think we need to ask to really sort of know, is it <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1235.128s">Is</a> it the words? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1237.131s">People</a> like the words, people don't like the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1240.074s">Is</a> it the intent of the words? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1241.977s">Is</a> it something else entirely? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1243.098s">So</a> I do think we will get a lot of varied input in these sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1250.367s">And</a> I think sort of classifying and categorizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1254.555s">what</a> somebody says is a mission statement response may actually be an action step. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1263.518s">But</a> I think either way, collecting the feedback from the community is important and valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1272.461s">And</a> then the other thing we'll talk about in a little bit is a survey that we can follow up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1278.643s">But</a> that was sort of how I was thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1282.784s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1286.357s">Okay,</a> Melanie.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1358.966s">The</a> only thing to think about from my perspective is that that set of roundtables was so squarely talking about back to school in COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1374.13s">it</a> will be a challenge to not talk about COVID here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1378.912s">Sorry,</a> just for a point of information, not that one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1397.279s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1398.4s">That</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1400.478s">Yeah</a> and that's been summarized. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1402.418s">I'm</a> sure the mayor can resurface that as input.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1506.694s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1509.32s">And,</a> you know, perhaps there's a way to weave in even the round tables that we did last year around back to school, as we would announce these round tables to say, you know, among the great feedback and suggestions we got in those round tables were these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1527.235s">And,</a> you know, we use them as we built our back to school plan and our task force and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1533.079s">So</a> there's an opportunity to sort of connect back to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1536.968s">the</a> value of the input of the community there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1540.948s">Kathy?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1703.326s">I</a> think you're freezing and we missed a little bit of what you just said.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1895.585s">so</a> that really between April and the month of May could be really working that plan so that it could be presented to the school committee in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1904.931s">So</a> I was just, it feels like March is flying by, but it's only the second day of March just in case anybody else is wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1913.036s">So,</a> I mean, I do think it's really reasonable like to do this in early April so that <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1919.76s">They</a> can they can happen, and still give your team and the school committee, enough time, I, I'm based on what we heard from the mayor about sort of the budget planning process it sounds like the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1936.035s">Budget</a> discussions are going to lag a bit while the city waits for direction and guidance, hopefully in a good direction from the Biden administration in particular, but you know, perhaps we can target these and I obviously we have to bring that to the whole committee, but perhaps we can target these for like the week of April 5th so that <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1959.228s">we</a> can get them, we can get the feedback, we can get ready to kick off like a survey, but you all can progressively be pulling that information to your plan, so to speak, that you already have the bones and the framework of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1981.181s">So</a> I sort of feel like to really round out the strategic plan <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=1988.85s">aligning</a> it to that community expectation is A, really important, and B, not substantively changing the how of many of the tasks, maybe adding, maybe changing some, but I wouldn't see that work as a wholesale change to the work you've already done or will continue to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2013.98s">At</a> least that's sort of my take. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2016.642s">I</a> don't know what you think about that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2128.937s">Yeah,</a> and I would say that that is sort of a really natural evolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2137.122s">as</a> you talk about like strategic planning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2139.344s">Like</a> the overall organization has to like set the plan and then the sub organizations or the schools, the individual schools, you know, have to sort of take and tailor their own individual operations to align to that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2156.118s">So</a> I wouldn't think that they would be doing that in this school year anyway, because there's just, there's only so much you can do <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2165.781s">in</a> one school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2166.742s">So</a> that seems like a natural, you know, phase two next step iteration of the evolution of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2182.753s">So</a> does trying to target the week of April 6th make sense?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2306.138s">Yeah,</a> I think it totally could. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2307.499s">If</a> that is doing it like Monday and <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2311.203s">Tuesday</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2313.005s">That</a> would be fine.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2366.986s">I</a> wonder if we could do one later in the evening, little bit later in the evening so that folks who have trouble with five o'clock could attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2376.833s">I</a> don't have an issue with that, but I know that I generally try not to schedule meetings too late because it's the end of an already long day, but I'm open to that so that we can make sure that the community can participate.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2467.786s">I</a> think whatever works for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2471.107s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2471.808s">It</a> doesn't matter to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2472.988s">I</a> don't know, Kathy and Melanie, if you have any.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2514.294s">And</a> we can confirm that when we read out the minutes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2519.037s">So</a> when we do that at the meeting on Monday, this, yeah, this coming Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2528.104s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2529.845s">And</a> then the other thing we talked about last time was providing a survey so that people who can engage in that, in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2543.598s">uh,</a> in the breakout sessions have an opportunity to, to weigh in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2548.001s">So</a> I did, um, let me just try to put this all on one page so that I did come up with like a rough list of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2556.327s">Um,</a> I'll start at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2558.669s">These</a> are the demographic questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2561.13s">Um,</a> I actually took these right from the survey, the surveying that we did, uh, when we solicited input for the superintendent search, because we worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2570.153s">rather</a> extensively to make sure we were reflecting all the demographic questions and the way in which they were asked was something we spent a lot of time on so I just sort of stole from there and if I recall correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2585.403s">So</a> if you use SurveyMonkey, which is I think what we used, it recommends the answers to these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2592.805s">So</a> age, gender, how would you describe yourself, which is a question that I can't remember what those sub questions were, but that was sort of a newer one that <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2611.008s">we</a> felt was meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2613.369s">What</a> language do you mainly speak at home? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2615.59s">What's</a> your highest level of, your highest degree or level of school you've completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2621.173s">And</a> I forgot to finish the question there, so I'll fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2627.937s">Total</a> combined income of your household. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2630.218s">How</a> many children of high school age or younger live in your house? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2635.641s">Are</a> you or is a member of your household disabled? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2638.848s">in</a> which neighborhood do you live and what is your sexual orientation? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2642.191s">So</a> that was sort of our, at the time, that was our work to say, we wanna know if we're hearing from a community that represents what our community looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2656.444s">So</a> those are the demographic questions, but in terms of the actual questions, these would be the actual questions that I came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2666.872s">One</a> is, does the current mission statement adequately describe the long range work that MPS needs to do on behalf of the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2675.438s">Scale</a> of one to 10 with some like free text response. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2679.902s">How</a> well does each portion of MPS's current vision statement describe what you feel MPS should achieve in X number of years? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2686.587s">So</a> however many number of years the strategic plan is looking to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2693.231s">Whatever</a> those vision statement items are, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2696.216s">we</a> would ask for some assessment of each of those vision statement items. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2708.783s">Two</a> other questions, if sort of the results of <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2713.58s">Some</a> of the work we do allow us to think that we might make a change, so this is one of those places where if like we the early feedback we get says everyone's really happy with the vision and the mission statements like what we would probably have to change these questions, but assuming that some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2731.138s">might</a> be made if as part of a strategic plan we change our mission statement to one of the below please rank in order of preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2737.884s">And</a> you know, whatever sort of the thinking is or the options are that we're asking we would be asking people to weigh in on and then we're considering a revised vision statement that may include the following items, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2749.193s">rate</a> and order of the importance to you and your and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2751.694s">So</a> again, just giving people sort of some pre like some previewing of things that we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2759.276s">If</a> in fact, we are going in that direction, obviously, if we're not thinking about making changes, we would change the nature of that question a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2766.679s">But</a> when I was again, trying to think about like, we still don't, we still can't expect the community to <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2775.461s">weigh</a> in on the how we will do these things because that's really where the internal work and expertise is required in order to actually make a good plan, but this is, you know, I think could be a good way for us to collect some information from a broader <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2794.992s">group</a> of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2795.713s">The</a> survey was translated when we did the superintendent search committee as well, but that was trying to keep it short and simple, but also be engaging to the larger community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2810.044s">So</a> that's what I came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2816.049s">Thoughts,</a> questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2950.101s">These</a> are all, yeah, they are all multiple choice questions, the demographic questions in particular.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2959.188s">So</a> this was, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2962.474s">This</a> was the result of the superintendent search survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2966.075s">Can</a> you see this? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2968.316s">So</a> yeah, each question had a series of responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2975.859s">The</a> survey monkey itself recommended these allocations, if that makes sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2987.284s">So</a> yeah, they're all here and I would, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=2990.968s">recommend</a> that we use them just the way that they are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3016.341s">Yeah,</a> so those would definitely be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3019.483s">Broken</a> down. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3020.612s">that</a> way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3032.717s">I</a> know thoughts, questions, it's sort of just to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3035.919s">Like</a> I think you would definitely want to wait to finalize the questions until the roundtables were done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3043.602s">But</a> that was sort of my, <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3046.42s">my</a> thought in terms of how do we meaningfully engage the community in this discussion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3078.225s">So</a> I mean certainly it could go out like during April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3083.428s">I</a> just it it was sort of my sense that if we we would need some time between the roundtables and this kickoff of the survey to finalize the survey and then you'd want to send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3098.618s">So</a> it could even I mean it could go out during the week of <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3101.584s">of</a> April vacation or it could go out on your Friday communication before the end of that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3109.236s">Somewhat</a> flexible, but I wouldn't, you know, I feel like surveys are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3114.426s">sort</a> of diminishing in the number of people, like people respond early, then it wanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3119.889s">And</a> then at the due date, you get the last flurry. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3122.911s">And</a> that will stretch out sort of as long as you let the survey out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3128.655s">So</a> being finite about a couple of weeks, I feel like is more than enough time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3167.919s">Melanie,</a> Kathy, any other questions, thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3176.491s">And</a> I will share this document, Dr. Edouard-Vincent with you and Susie as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3195.38s">The</a> school committee no no engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3199.122s">We</a> would not be meeting another time or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3204.545s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3205.646s">Well,</a> we're not scheduled to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3213.23s">We</a> can, but we're not scheduled to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3287.142s">Okay,</a> so motion to approve the proposed roundtable plan and survey by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3296.808s">Roll</a> call. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3297.469s">So</a> member Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3299.95s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3301.011s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3303.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3304.747s">Three</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3307.988s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3310.469s">And</a> that is the end of our agenda.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3337.834s">Okay,</a> motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3341.977s">Roll</a> call, Member Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3344.559s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3345.84s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OEoD865cVp0&t=3346.801s">Member</a> McLaughlin?<h2><a href="../2021-03-01_fZRb63TV1uM/2021-03-01_fZRb63TV1uM.html">Committee of the Whole Meeting - Superintendent's Evaluation</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=65.605s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=66.666s">Yes,</a> Member Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=68.287s">Are</a> we still a physical posting city? <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=70.448s">So</a> in other words, <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=72.468s">isn't</a> the question whether Clerk Hurtubise has this physically posted in order for it to be a compliant meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=82.217s">Is</a> that correct still? <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=84.058s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=85.259s">Okay,</a> so does the clerk have this meeting posted?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=89.363s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=99.872s">Um,</a> and then, you know, questions about not being a physical posting city, I think are important ones for the city to take up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=107.696s">But,</a> um, as it relates to compliance with the open meeting lie, I think as long as it's posted with the clerk, we're okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=118.081s">I'll</a> be right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1692.11s">Thank</a> you, Maurice for all your hard work, I think, you know, doing a review is always sort of challenging because you're trying to encapsulate a lot of work into a few bullets and to be concise and but to be specific so it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1709.883s">it's</a> a really complicated process on its best day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1713.307s">It's</a> even more complicated when we sort of throw at you seven people's like opinions of the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1720.213s">So</a> I do want you to know that if you have questions about my comments in particular, I'm always happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1727.701s">And</a> I do know that as someone who's invested in growth mindset like yourself, that <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1734.727s">you</a> probably read the areas of opportunity as like the loudest, shoutiest things on this review because that is what happens when you are committed to moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1746.131s">And</a> so certainly making sure that you know that we weren't just like loudly shouting about the things that you could continue to progress on and do better on, but just overall your commitment over this pandemic has been remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1763.098s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1764.413s">Thank</a> you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1765.554s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2021-02-22_nnsRDJfWfaQ/2021-02-22_nnsRDJfWfaQ.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10829.54s">Thank</a> you, Alicia, for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10832.422s">So</a> just to sort of close out the conversation around the supplemental appropriation, I think one of the most valuable parts of the budget process for the community, and I know for myself, is that's the opportunity where we say, we're gonna hire a middle school health teacher, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10854.504s">And</a> that person, that headcount is in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10857.786s">And</a> then we know what to look forward to the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10860.628s">So</a> I do think we should get a full accounting of the budget's plan for that million dollars plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10869.233s">Not</a> because I disagree with or I anticipate disagreeing with how you <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10875.317s">have</a> spent it because as you said the reality of the positions we needed versus the positions we could afford to pay for before that amount of money in in the form of teachers, aids, etc like the, that reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10892.022s">was</a> just exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10894.724s">It</a> was a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10895.984s">And</a> further, the money came so very late in the cycle that I am completely comfortable that you all had to put teachers in place to start the year literally within days of the appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10913.879s">So</a> I don't think that it's a matter of feeling like there's discretionary money in there, but I do think it's worth the time to say, this allowed us to reinstate four elementary school teachers, three middle school teachers, two high school teachers, whatever, because to us, to the community, to the kids who have those teachers, they don't know that those teachers weren't gonna be there had that money not come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10944.069s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10944.39s">Like</a> you all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10945.631s">But</a> I think it's really important for the community to know just how, you know, just exactly how that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10953.138s">So</a> I do think that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10955.4s">And</a> I do think to make sure that the community is clear that you have the support of this committee, we should take an official vote to make sure that that can live as part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10968.49s">the</a> overall documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10969.731s">So</a> I'm happy to make a motion if that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10973.812s">If</a> you just want to put it on a future agenda, I'm fine with that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10977.954s">But</a> I do think that is really important when it comes to people understanding the situation as it unfolded in real time, how that has translated across the year, and to establish an important baseline for the next discussions of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10996.247s">Superintendent,</a> do you want me to make a motion or do you want to just provide that accounting?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11011.76s">I</a> would like a presentation so that we can vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11014.682s">I</a> don't know what we would be voting on.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11157.224s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11159.102s">That</a> I think that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11160.963s">And</a> then I do think as a committee, we should take a vote to formally approve those numbers so that they can be posted to the website and there can be no mistake about the committee support or lack of, but I don't anticipate that personally support for the supplemental budget.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11274.111s">So</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11274.831s">Nunley,</a> I had a couple of other questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11278.432s">You</a> referenced being able to provide information to us around costs that are incurred by the city that are reflective of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11290.075s">And</a> my question for you is, are you planning to do that for all departments? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11293.996s">Because</a> I would not want to see you do that only for the school department and not <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11298.457s">do</a> an equal allocation out of those costs to all departments, because that will kind of skew the look of those costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11309.344s">So</a> either you're going to do it, or I don't want you to do it special for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11315.087s">if</a> you're not going to do it for the rest of the city's department.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11357.737s">I</a> am fine with that as long as that 7% increase, which is going to be applied to the police department, the fire department, the department of public works and all the other departments in the city that hold staff, that same increase would happen across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11371.339s">So</a> all I'm asking is that if we're going to provide that level of information that we do so in a collectively objective way and that we don't cherry pick out <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11387.322s">stuff</a> for the schools that we are not cherry picking out to all the other organizations because that has the potential.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11420.236s">There's</a> a reason why, but I think it's important for the- I know, that's not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11426.179s">But</a> what I am saying is, when you talk about the school as a department, <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11433.031s">It's</a> not unlike talking about any other department in the city in terms of every department brings forward a budget and the community watches those budgets and they watch the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11443.4s">Do</a> they go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11444.081s">Do</a> they go down? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11445.542s">And</a> all I'm saying is if you're gonna present that information as money for the schools, which it certainly is, we just need to make sure that we're having a rounded discussion about that so that the money for the schools for health insurance is, <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11459.534s">is</a> identified for whatever it is for the employees who are here, but then that comparable money for the city's employees, whatever they are, it is talked about in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11473.064s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11473.905s">I</a> just, I don't want people getting something and then <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11480.229s">other</a> departments are or aren't like there's health insurance across every department in the city because everyone who has employees incurs health insurance and that is paid for by the the sort of city's general line items so if you're going to break out city line items i just want to make sure that we're really breaking it out and we're not just sort of tagging it to school because that to me that causes other problems and how we talk about this
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11543.448s">As</a> long as there's some way to understand and rationalize those numbers, like the city, the school, right, has more employees, which is why those numbers are higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11553.753s">So</a> as long as there's just a way for somebody to reasonably look at the information and say, I understand what this is telling me, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11560.936s">What</a> I don't want to see is us <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11564.384s">Throwing</a> numbers back and forth in a way that confuses that confuses the discussion about whether the city's appropriation to the schools, increased or decreased I feel like that number, like I feel like when we start talking about but we pay for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11580.837s">It's,</a> it's always to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11583.499s">sort</a> of demonstrate that that appropriation is not the only thing that comes to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11588.062s">And</a> that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11589.442s">But</a> that's true for every department that gets an amount of money in their budget from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11594.145s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're talking about apples and apples. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11598.427s">So</a> when we talk about that appropriation, we all can just be clear about what's in, what's not in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11605.291s">what</a> that number is, what it is not, and did it go up, did it go down, or did it stay the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11609.212s">There</a> should be no debate about that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11613.314s">And</a> as we sort of alluded to, when we talk about the school budget, a disproportionate amount of the school budget, perhaps unlike many other departments in the city, is based on personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11626.879s">Those</a> costs go up every year by contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11630.4s">But</a> like 90% of our budget is personnel oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11633.381s">So</a> when we talk about increases or decreases, that affects real people in the school department in a way that is not necessarily the case in any other sort of budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11648.604s">Usually</a> there's a little bit more non-personnel charges in a budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11653.925s">It's</a> something very unique about what we pay for in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11659.606s">And</a> so when we talk about increases, decreases, et cetera, we are talking about people positions disproportionately than maybe people generally expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11671.069s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we're doing <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11674.29s">our</a> part on the school side to have a more clear and transparent budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11677.553s">I</a> think you guys did a fabulous job on the city side last year and really sort of changing the professionalism and the look of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11684.338s">It</a> was very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11685.719s">I</a> want us to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11686.9s">I</a> want us to be really transparent about our revolving accounts and our grant funding and the CARES Act stuff I think is a great example of all the grant funding that we receive from various sources, it all has rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11704.194s">while</a> we're getting 2.3 million dollars for the next couple years we just had a discussion about how that's it's really not a viable funding source to add Councilors because those are people and they have ongoing recurring costs so I just want to make sure particularly as the conversation starts to unfold about the budget that we can be clear about the fact that the people in Medford public schools who service our students are part of <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11732.502s">The</a> budget that is served by the city's appropriation the grant funds that are being issued to us via for purposes of like pandemic mitigation have strings and we should just be clear about what they are and how we've spent them and Mr. Murphy did a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11749.832s">last</a> time so that there can just be no confusion about but we got more money like if that money doesn't come without sort of strings we have to on you know we we can't spend it if we're not honoring the the intent of that money so I just want to be really clear so that we're not confusing the community about like what does this extra money mean does this extra money mean we could have hired <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11773.108s">a</a> teacher to do something, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11776.432s">So</a> I just want to be super clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11778.014s">And</a> then my last question is, when will the school department expect to receive the city's appropriation number for us to be able to start our budgeting process?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11850.568s">And</a> is there a sort of a date where you will say, we don't have a number and we have to move forward with our budget planning?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11866.364s">Okay,</a> so that decision hasn't been made yet, is what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12382.206s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12384.609s">This</a> is really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12386.09s">Thank</a> you for doing the work to get this in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12388.952s">I</a> don't know how the group that they will work with will be formed, but I would just like to ask that at least one member of this committee is included in the working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12399.577s">I</a> think the visibility for the committee to have into some of this work is really important when we talk about connecting to the community and <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12412.023s">you</a> know certainly budgetary questions that come when you start talking about really formalizing systems and structures that would be needed to support enhancing our communication protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12423.553s">So</a> any you know I don't know exactly what the makeup of the committee is but I would just want to make sure that there is some representation from the school committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12971.862s">So</a> I just had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12976.103s">I</a> feel like it's always customary to see the specs or the designs before you would send it out to RFP, and I just wondered if the original resolution was to do this at the next meeting, which would afford time for <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12990.228s">us</a> to see like whatever it is that the architect has come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12995.63s">So</a> that might be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12997.65s">And</a> then I guess the other question that I have about the $816,000 is, it sounds like Mayor, you're suggesting we spend more money on bathrooms, but we still haven't had a capital planning meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13012.114s">And</a> I'm concerned that <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13014.195s">there</a> are other capital needs that should super, we should do the bathrooms too, in my opinion, but if there's only $816,000, are we sure that that's the best spend of that $816,000 or are there capital needs that are more pressing that we should be focused on? <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13030.998s">So</a> I guess I would just also not want us to commit to spending that money until we have that capital improvement planning discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13043.74s">to</a> know what other expenses are ahead of us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13335.406s">I</a> think it's not my sense that you need our approval to issue an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13340.671s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13348.838s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13350.623s">If</a> you're going to require a vote based on a set of specs that I haven't seen, I'm not gonna be in a position to say yes, but I also am perfectly fine if there is no need for a vote to get you to issue an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13365.071s">I'm</a> totally fine with that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13366.512s">I</a> would still like to see the specs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13368.753s">They</a> haven't been provided to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13370.374s">I</a> don't know if I've just fell off the email or if there are others. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13374.096s">So</a> I would like to see the specs. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=13376.457s">I</a> don't personally need to vote on having you issue an RFP because I feel like that's regular course of business for the administration.<h2><a href="../2021-02-10_FZwgyiFG-8I/2021-02-10_FZwgyiFG-8I.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=211.198s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=214.6s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1018.986s">I</a> guess my only comment to that would be the goal, at least in part, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1027.397s">for</a> me is to do the financial review of the revolving accounts and to shed some light on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1034.86s">So</a> I just, I do wonder if any of these like financial reviews of our evolving accounts really should be part of the normal meeting or if there should be dedicated, you know, committee of the holes or whatever associated with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1055.815s">I</a> could go either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1056.916s">I</a> just want to make sure if we're planning for these to be part of the regular meeting that we are allocating the time to an actual financial review, which is what we should be doing with all these revolving accounts on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1068.985s">So</a> I don't particularly care about the format of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1072.687s">I</a> just want to make sure that whenever we do it, we're not just like sort of passing it along and not doing the financial review, which I think is the fundamental requirement.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1098.199s">Yeah,</a> it's a budget, it's a budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1100.361s">And</a> then whatever form that takes might, that might make more sense.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1176.517s">I</a> haven't seen us get to a point where we have an actual like functioning capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1183.139s">I</a> think we have pieces of what I would consider to be a functional capital improvement plan, but <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1190.291s">I</a> think until we really get a format and a cadence down about how things would surface to that list and how we would talk about it, I would keep it as a committee of the whole.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1229.77s">I</a> was at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1230.61s">I</a> would say it was the first time we did anything formal, but I would not say that it was fully functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1237.312s">Because</a> I remember hearing feedback that the principals were not consulted on what went on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1247.554s">and</a> they're largely responsible for their buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1249.175s">So</a> I think, you know, I think there's just a process of like, how do things get surfaced to the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1255.519s">What</a> happens once they get on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1258.301s">You</a> know, those kinds of things that I think there's just still some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1260.882s">There's</a> still just work to do, that's all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1463.742s">I</a> mean, I think the, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1465.671s">I</a> think what it probably means is our series of pre-budget meetings that we have where we review all the departments, we go through their narratives and their budgets and their lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1478.363s">So</a> I don't think it's a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1480.284s">I</a> think it's a series of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1482.767s">I</a> thought what we went through on Monday night was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1486.95s">like</a> the kickoff of the budget season essentially, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1491.111s">Like</a> it was great because it, I thought it did a better job than the district has really ever done in saying like, this is how, this is how school budgets are created. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1502.695s">But</a> like, you know, last year we had a meeting where we talked about things we wanted to see in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1508.256s">I</a> think we sort of did that on Monday night, but I, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1516.393s">I</a> considered that more like the kickoff than I did like the whole like pre-budget season.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1651.046s">Yeah,</a> the only thing I would say is, again, the short collaborative is a specific revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1659.539s">And</a> we had that meeting and it was, I thought it was really helpful information, but we didn't talk at all about the details of the revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1666.745s">So</a> not all out of district places are associated with a revolving account in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1672.569s">So</a> I think that's just a nuance that I wanna make sure it doesn't get lost because it's our responsibility to be looking at those revolving accounts.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1713.713s">We</a> have a list of revolving accounts that are established, I think by regulation at the State House that govern any instances where we are taking in revenue that is coming in sort of separate and apart from our city appropriation, separate and apart from our grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1736.837s">But</a> the accounts are set up to do just that, to revolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1740.288s">So</a> we can take money in, we can pay money out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1744.062s">on</a> any of those accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1746.303s">There</a> are lots of like legal and compliance issues associated with what you can take in and out of each one and how the money is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1755.146s">And</a> we are working actively on creating a more clear way to describe that those processes with all of those independent revolving accounts, because they are all a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1767.73s">So</a> that when people look at those numbers, there's some context of what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1773.865s">is</a> like, you know, if there's $100,000 in a revolving account, is that a good thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1778.347s">Is</a> it a bad thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1779.328s">And</a> the answer is, it depends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1781.929s">So</a> really sort of adding some context around what's the like nature and purpose of the revolving account, and then how do we account for all the funds that go in and out?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1840.995s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1843.456s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=1936.405s">Motion</a> to approve?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2032.969s">I</a> had a couple of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2036.552s">Items</a> here, and I thought I actually tagged them in the Google drive, but I'm not seeing them on your copy, so I'll just tell you what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2044.533s">In</a> the first paragraph where it says, including Head Start comparable preschool programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2057.363s">Yeah,</a> see, including, I would say including, but not limited to, and I was also a little bit further down in that list of options. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2066.089s">It</a> lists gifted and talented programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2068.971s">And</a> I would actually recommend that we <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2072.898s">strike</a> that, because A, we don't have it, but B, that's a different nut for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2081.222s">So</a> I would recommend that we remove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2084.204s">And</a> then if you go down to page two at the bottom, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2090.727s">This</a> paragraph that starts with, if the student does not have immediate access to immunization records, I think this is basically saying that students can still enroll under a personal exception and that students and families will be encouraged to get their documents as soon as possible and the district liaison is directed to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2113.13s">I</a> guess my question was, is it our policy that they will assist just with like getting the records or if students lack immunization, is the district liaison also going to help ensure that they have like appropriate access to a provider who can help them get their immunizations? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2134.46s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2136.34s">So</a> it's like paperwork or is it immunization or is it both?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2188.579s">So</a> perhaps we can just say the district liaison is directed to assist in obtaining available records and or immunization or something like that that calls that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2209.369s">Cause</a> when I read it, I was like, are we worried about paperwork or like students being immunized? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2214.492s">And</a> I think it's both. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2215.352s">So</a> I wanna make sure it says that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2225.356s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2228.878s">And</a> then on the next page under dispute resolution, what is that number two and that number three?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2284.465s">I</a> was like, if this is a list of something I'm missing item number one, because it's like, that's what caught my eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2290.588s">And</a> then I was like, wait, there's links here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2291.929s">I'm</a> not sure what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2292.829s">So</a> I just wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2294.03s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2295.451s">That</a> was those were all of my questions on this one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2393.945s">That's</a> why you're not seeing your, um, your it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2396.867s">I</a> literally, I was just putting them in before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2399.347s">So,</a> um, but I did have a couple of questions about this one under definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2404.969s">Um,</a> we talk about children enrolled kindergarten through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2409.051s">Um,</a> does this policy need to cover our pre-K students?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2505.881s">There's</a> one other on page two in the third bullet, there's another reference to gifted and talented programs that we should strike.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2536.236s">And</a> other than that, I'm fine with this, if you can confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2542.119s">So</a> as a motion to approve as amended.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2652.398s">Yes,</a> sorry, I lost my mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2654.12s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2654.56s">Couldn't</a> get to the mute button.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2658.343s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2722.052s">I</a> just had a couple of maybe questions for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2725.996s">And</a> it's really around like <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2730.28s">A</a> little bit around how, how does this actually work so and the reason I asked is because I've been told by teachers that they've been told they can't do these very things by various members of the leadership team over the years and. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2746.507s">I</a> don't know if that's like still the case or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2748.748s">I'm</a> assuming it's not if we're creating this policy, but there's definitely like a vibe out there that this is not this is not allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2756.772s">So</a> I just, you know, a couple of things that jumped out at me like in the third paragraph, we talk about the prince, you know, they need to communicate to the principles around <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2768.593s">any</a> sort of online fundraising or crowdsourcing they're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2772.556s">And</a> I would like to see that be tracked consistently because I would like to have some visibility into what things teachers are out fundraising for that the district is not providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2784.924s">And</a> then sort of in a related sense, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2788.906s">If</a> you scroll down to the bottom of that page, it says employees using crowdfunding services shall periodically disclose the individuals who have supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2801.855s">I</a> would recommend that that actually be a requirement at the completion of such an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2810.32s">Usually,</a> they're fairly time limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2813.102s">But</a> again, doing that in a way that is consistent across <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2817.473s">buildings</a> and teachers that is seamless that doesn't create like a pile of work for Susie or somebody else, but provide some visibility to us about about things that are being funded and that and and whatnot, and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2834.388s">In</a> that same paragraph, it says the superintendent shall maintain these disclosures as public records available for public review. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2839.593s">I</a> would actually love to see this become an annual report that is informative to us at budget time, because if our teachers are, you know, if all of our teachers are out fundraising for something like headphones, right, and I know we've got a lot of headphones right now, so that's probably not something they're gonna do, but if they're all out fundraising for headphones, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2862.547s">I</a> think the school committee needs to know that that's a deficiency in the structure of the budget, that these things that are being requested universally are not being provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2871.931s">So</a> I think in this similar spirit to wanting to understand PTOs and other organizations that are fundraising to supplement school budgets, I would like to see us codify this in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2887.776s">So</a> I'm not necessarily, I don't have a lot of changes to this <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=2892.227s">document,</a> but it's more of, I think, a process question and maybe it needs to tie back to the report list that we just talked about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3119.473s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3120.494s">Yeah,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3121.614s">I</a> mean, you know, the whole notion of like, how we asset tag these things is a different can of worms like I, you know, I, I've been involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3132.878s">PTOs,</a> you know, with my kids and, you know, there was a year we bought rugs for every teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3139.286s">Those</a> rugs, you know, I think if you ask the PTO, they would be like, yeah, we gave them to the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3145.253s">And</a> the PTOs are sort of, you know, it's not top of mind for them and through no criticism to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3152.702s">Who</a> am I giving this to? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3153.683s">Am</a> I giving this to Marice Edouard-Vincent or am I giving this to the school and Marice Edouard-Vincent's going to use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3161.63s">There's</a> probably like a sort of a sidebar discussion that we could have about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3166.054s">But</a> certainly if we're taking an equipment, it should definitely be asset tagged so it can be tracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3173.38s">So</a> yeah, I just, as I was reading this, I wasn't sure that, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3178.244s">whether</a> or not there was a way for it to be clear to the school committee what those things are so that we can have a sense of like where the funding is falling short or how teachers are innovating in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3191.528s">So</a> those were all of my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3194.129s">They</a> were sort of all tied up in the same sort of thought process for this one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3385.267s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3387.629s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3470.077s">Okay,</a> sorry, I was just finishing reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3472.379s">I</a> missed this one.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3475.061s">No,</a> it's okay, I'm done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=3656.824s">And</a> I read that one, I didn't have any questions about it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZwgyiFG-8I&t=4071.066s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-02-08_rbPzEysIPRU/2021-02-08_rbPzEysIPRU.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3557.533s">I</a> just want to remind everyone that before everything changed super dramatically, this was a committee of the whole that we had agreed to schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3566.897s">So</a> we talked at the very beginning of last year about the importance of having goals that we want to work toward as a committee and particularly around our procedures and how things are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3583.284s">And</a> I think we've done some of those things <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3585.512s">sort</a> of inherently as we've gone, like the scheduling of the subcommittees out for the year, I think was like a really important thing that we have done this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3595.136s">And</a> it seemed maybe like too structured at the beginning, but I think it has actually worked well to keep all of the priorities of our committees on task. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3605.806s">And</a> so I would just say that I don't know that we need a motion because it was already on our like to be scheduled agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3611.614s">But</a> if we do need a motion, I'm happy to be a second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3771.526s">We</a> met last week and we actually covered two topics because our January meeting was canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3778.373s">So</a> we first covered the topic of the district-wide strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3782.298s">So</a> if you remember in <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3784.303s">Like</a> early March of last year, the superintendent provided us a draft of the high level of the district-wide strategic plan that the administrators had been working on for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3796.392s">And</a> we talked extensively in our meeting about how to pick up that work and how we wanted to see it proceed forward, particularly in light of the fact that there's so much going on across the district <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3812.745s">and</a> continues to be with the pandemic, but that this is important work and we didn't want it to delay unnecessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3821.449s">And</a> so we really wanted, we sort of were all in agreement that we wanted to see this move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3825.491s">So</a> we hashed out sort of a rough timeline and schedule that I think is important for people to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3830.293s">At</a> our March meeting, we will actually create a plan for a round table discussion and a survey to be executed in the month of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3842.627s">And</a> that will be our opportunity to hear from the community about the substance and detail of our strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3852.103s">So</a> at our scheduled subcommittee meeting in March, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3855.786s">will</a> hash through the plan for a roundtable and a resulting survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3861.311s">We'll</a> execute both of those in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3863.313s">In</a> May, that will be sort of the time where the administrators take all that feedback and revisit and revise based on really all the things that have changed across <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3877.587s">the</a> original draft of the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3879.889s">And</a> then the sort of the final piece being in June, we would all meet to talk about if this is our strategic plan and this is our revised state, what does the timeline of various activities look like so that we can measure progress against that timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3897.363s">So</a> the schedule that we laid out will by June give us not just a strategic plan that consolidates <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3907.949s">all</a> of the activity going on across the district, across a lot of different topics, but it will also have allowed us to collect community input, which we have not done so far as it relates to the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3918.413s">And</a> it will also allow us to create a timeline of like the order of operation and importance of various activities because we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3930.251s">do</a> everything at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3931.412s">So</a> we really will need to think about what comes first, second, and third. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3935.013s">And</a> so that timeline piece is sort of the final piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3938.535s">And</a> I would anticipate that we would potentially work on that together in a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3945.338s">But</a> I think once we get through the first couple of steps, we can revisit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3951.381s">And</a> then the other topic that we covered in our meeting was really around middle school orientation practices in a similar vein to what we <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3959.461s">had</a> discussed with kindergarten orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3962.562s">And</a> we talked about sort of a rough timeline which included that the lottery process and work will begin soon now that the quarter two has ended and that the administration is targeting early March to kick off that lottery process for our fifth grade team so that students know <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3987.653s">In</a> March where where they will be going to middle school next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3991.557s">We</a> did talk about, you know, the options and the things we we like to do and want to do around <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3998.943s">the</a> open houses and whether they can be held in person this year or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4003.024s">We</a> talked about the really great community building that happened at the annual cookout that started and was delayed this year, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4015.128s">But</a> we also talked about the info sessions that the superintendent has done these past few years that were really previously dedicated to <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4022.99s">the</a> sort of, I'll say the mechanics of the lottery expanding to really talk about the transition to middle school in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4029.534s">So</a> much like our bridges to kindergarten, giving parents, particularly parents with new middle schoolers, a bridge to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4044.044s">And</a> our next scheduled meeting is on Monday, March 1st.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8516.708s">So</a> the problem as I see it with putting this in a subcommittee is it limits the participation of the entire committee in the formation and the early decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8529.071s">So</a> four members of this committee would not have a voice except to accept or object to whatever is presented really at the end of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8545.48s">And</a> that's not what I think would make the most effective budget possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8550.403s">So</a> I would be an advocate for maintaining the committee of the whole structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8554.685s">I</a> don't care who chairs the meetings, but I do think that school finance and how we fund our priorities is critically important for the entire committee to have a voice in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8570.723s">I</a> also would love to see us pursue a better looking budget that is more understandable than we've ever provided before. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8578.647s">The</a> MASC held a session in the last month or so where they talked about budget preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8587.672s">I</a> think the city did a wonderful job last year of improving the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8593.496s">the</a> clarity and the transparency of the budget itself so that the community could understand what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8602.121s">And</a> I think we should be trying to do the same thing here in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8604.903s">So</a> I would like to, I do think it's appropriate that the personnel and budget subcommittee talk about and lay out what the expectations for the ultimate document would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8615.19s">But</a> I don't support putting all the work of this on three people <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8620.853s">I</a> don't think that is how we bring our collective values and vision to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8627.241s">And</a> then a couple of other things that I will say is, last year, we asked a question of all the department heads about objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8640.11s">that</a> are not in the current budget that would improve student outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8644.333s">And</a> that list was a really eye-opening and meaningful list. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8647.335s">And</a> my expectation is that that work will continue this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8652.518s">But</a> also one of the things that happened last year before your arrival, Mr. Murphy, is it was very difficult to look at the structure of what was being presented to us and know where the new stuff was. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8665.907s">So</a> some new stuff was listed in this <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8668.388s">list</a> of like extra things that are not in the budget and then other new things were in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8674.132s">And</a> it was very difficult to figure out where they landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8677.053s">So</a> if we're going to take the approach of sort of looking at what level fund means, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8684.163s">in</a> one cut of the information that's provided to us, then I want that to truly reflect like base operations and not new headcount, new priorities, new objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8698.166s">So,</a> and the example that comes to mind is like the middle school health teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8702.747s">So</a> she was, she, he was listed in the budget as like a thing we were definitely going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8711.489s">And</a> then we didn't do it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8713.97s">That</a> that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8715.991s">But</a> it also wasn't on the list of sort of extra priorities and it was just sort of assumed that it would happen and it did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8722.554s">So</a> there, I think, where we talk about ads to the overall picture, I just wanted to be really clear what those choices are so that the committee can actually make those choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8735.661s">versus</a> be confused by what's in, what's not in, what are we saying is part of what we're gonna do next year, what are we hoping, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8746.46s">It</a> just needs to be really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8749.768s">The</a> other thing that I would say about the work that we did last year is that the pandemic certainly got in the way of the timeline, but I would like a clear understanding of when the number comes from the mayor's office so that we can be clear about at what point in the discussion are we no longer talking about theoretical numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8771.719s">And</a> at what point in the discussion are we talking about the real number? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8774.841s">that</a> we're being asked to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8777.542s">That</a> was not made clear to us until very late in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8780.823s">I'm</a> not saying that the finance office didn't know that number, but it was not made clear to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8785.965s">So</a> again, we are the ones that are asked questions that are expected to sort of shepherd this district in a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8792.968s">And</a> we can't do that without all the information available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8796.909s">If</a> there's going to be a cut, we need to own the cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8800.13s">We</a> need to describe why the cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8802.29s">And</a> I don't think that's work that this committee can do without input from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8806.091s">So</a> I'm very concerned about the information that we are hearing already from all sources, including from our city, about what this budget is going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8818.174s">And</a> I feel like we have to find a way to discuss what we really need to recover next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8827.076s">and</a> how we go about making sure that our kids don't become an entire generation of students that get left behind, not just because of COVID, but because we didn't do the right things to prioritize the funding that was necessary to help mitigate against all the impacts of these last few years and really into <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8848.115s">know</a> into next year and into the year after. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8850.216s">So</a> we're talking about an entire generation of kids and it's really important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8854.737s">So</a> I am hopeful that our spending will align with what we say our values are and our city you know certainly clearly values the contributions of Medford Public Schools and I hope that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8870.903s">present</a> a budget that is reflective of those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8874.505s">But</a> I think we need to be crystal clear about when the number comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8877.586s">We</a> need to be really transparent about what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8880.568s">And</a> we need to be clear with the community about who has the power to change what. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8886.831s">And</a> this committee, we can only decide how to spend the money and how to make the cuts or how to spend the extra money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8896.256s">Those</a> are sort of the latitudes of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8901.313s">And</a> having said that, it's our responsibility to hold the people around us that have the other responsibilities that lead up to this accountable for a transparent message on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8914.363s">And</a> so that our constituents are just super clear about where we are at and so that they can all make decisions about how that impacts their participation in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8927.373s">Because</a> I think there are scenarios that could <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8930.662s">land</a> people in that position where they say, I need to evaluate my participation here if this is how we're going to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8937.807s">So</a> I know we're hearing doom and gloom from lots of places. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8942.49s">I</a> also know that the state's revenue blew the doors off its projections for January. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8948.014s">So</a> perhaps there's some better news coming, but either way, I want us to proceed with an open dialogue and transparency <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8958.36s">around</a> what the funding is, what decisions will be made, and how that helps us align our priorities or doesn't.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10380.353s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10382.334s">I</a> think it will mean a lot to all the families in the district who have struggled through this year and last year in one way or another to have an audience and an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10395.02s">And</a> I know it's a tremendous amount of work to put these things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10397.601s">So</a> I wanted to offer my assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10400.602s">I'm</a> happy to facilitate, take notes, or do anything else that you all <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10407.129s">need</a> as an extra pair of hands at any or all of the sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10411.832s">I'll</a> make myself available and I will tell my clients they have to wait another day so that I can go listen to the students too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10420.336s">So</a> just let me know what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10422.237s">I'm</a> happy to help.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10449.667s">Yeah,</a> I just had a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10452.788s">In</a> our last meeting, we talked about, particularly around the reopening plan, that there would be something added to address the plan for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10464.031s">And</a> I just didn't see it, but I may have missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10468.292s">So</a> I didn't know if that had been added or if there was a reason it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10472.533s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11978.931s">The</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11980.111s">The</a> presentation was really helpful in sort of laying out all the various sources, and I know that's been a questions been asked a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11987.954s">I</a> had a question at one point in the last couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11992.356s">I</a> think it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11992.996s">It's</a> a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11993.757s">It's</a> a little bit hazy when I saw this fly by, but there was some. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11996.738s">There</a> was a ruling about the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11999.219s">I</a> think it was from cares act in terms of the requirement of districts to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12007.062s">give</a> certain amount of funding to parochial schools, private and parochial schools that had been reversed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12013.265s">Can</a> you describe what happened there for us and how that impacted?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12107.012s">And</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12109.794s">You</a> do you have a timeline for when you expect to be talking about the grant spending of this upcoming funding and what the plans are for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12120.162s">In</a> terms of how does that relate to the budget process in general?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12239.134s">Fingers</a> crossed on the waning for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12242.397s">And</a> so one of the reasons I ask is because we delayed the spend of a considerable amount of money before you joined us in this happy party in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12257.709s">And</a> the delay of the spend and the allocation and the approvals <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12262.766s">are</a> at least part of the reason why we did not get all the equipment in that we expected so that it could be used in time for the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12272.669s">I'm</a> not 100% clear myself whether we've even yet received all of that technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12277.911s">And</a> I just wanna make sure that we're planful so that that doesn't happen again.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=151.288s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=157.971s">Can</a> you all hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=163.733s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=164.613s">Give</a> me one second to pull up my agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=181.712s">I</a> am going to start reading so that we can get going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=185.094s">Please</a> be advised that on Tuesday, February 2 from five to 630 there'll be a communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=201.52s">and</a> the governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford School Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=213.163s">Specific</a> information and the general guidelines for remote participation of members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=226.885s">For</a> this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=233.608s">No</a> in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=243.051s">In</a> the event that we are unable to do so despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford and Medford community media websites and audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=256.125s">The</a> meeting can be viewed from Medford community media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 from five to 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=264.846s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely participants can call or log in by using the following link or call in number. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=271.869s">So</a> one of the call in numbers is 301-715-8592. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=274.63s">And</a> the meeting ID is 923-9988-1674. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=276.31s">Our</a> agenda tonight has two items on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=280.812s">The</a> first is our <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=294.467s">district-wide</a> strategic plan, and the second is middle school orientation practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=300.173s">So</a> I think I will start by calling the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=304.057s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=305.939s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=307.401s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=308.702s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=309.663s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=310.243s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=310.564s">So</a> three present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=314.233s">The</a> first topic on the agenda is starting to revisit the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=320.715s">And</a> my goal for the meeting today, because I had to cancel the January subcommittee meeting, was just to talk about sort of the thoughts about getting the strategic plan sort of back to the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=339.12s">And</a> thinking really about a timeline of how we would like to proceed as a committee, as it relates to the strategic plan so obviously it's meatier than any given hour and a half meeting so I just wanted to have a couple of minutes of discussion around sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=355.856s">where</a> we hit the pause button, I guess, at the beginning of the pandemic, and then what we're planning, you know, how we're planning to pick that back up since then so that we can pick that up, make whatever revisions are necessary, and continue to move through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=374.168s">So</a> Dr. Edward-Vincent, do you want to jump in and give us sort of a <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=382.026s">a</a> reminder of what that looked like back before all of this change has happened.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1211.569s">Wouldn't</a> that be a fun day to not have to worry about COVID for just one glorious day?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1234.922s">never</a> ever right so you know I think when we when we left off this document was presented to the school committee and then it was referred to this subcommittee and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1250.17s">I</a> tried to remember sort of my thoughts at that time and I went back and looked through some of my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1256.913s">And</a> I think, you know, one of the things that I was hoping we could do today is talk about like the right ways to engage the community in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1265.377s">And,</a> you know, I think one of the things that sort of stood out to me that I recall at the time was <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1270.699s">I</a> read the mission and the vision statement, and I don't believe it's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1274.742s">And</a> I think even pre-pandemic, my question was, should it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1283.069s">It's</a> a big mouthful of words, and I think the sentiment is there, but I also sort of wonder if it resonates with our community at large, the overall mission and vision.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1895.959s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1898.842s">And</a> I guess, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1902.278s">You</a> know, one of the things that was so interesting about the reopening task force that we had is that when you brought all those folks together, they'll like really different takes on the same thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1913.663s">And</a> so it was, it was a really valuable exercise in just sort of understanding different perspectives across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1922.307s">And</a> I, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1924.208s">I</a> know we need to sort of move on, but I don't want to not have sort of a set of action items about the strategic plan because it is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1933.527s">Part</a> of me is, you know, wants to have some discussion about how we engage the community in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1941.73s">And</a> then I think the other thing for the school committee to consider is, you know, part of the value of the strategic plan is, as you say, like, so that all of the folks that we're asking to align to it and do work <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1957.836s">In</a> support of it know what that work looks like and why they're doing it and where it fits. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1961.979s">But</a> the other value of the strategic plan for the school committee in the community is to say these are our priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1968.023s">So</a> when we start to talk about budgeting and things like if we if we want to have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1976.189s">If</a> the website becomes the most important thing and we're not resourced to support The changes to the website that sort of get us to the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1984.696s">That's</a> a decision point for the committee to make In terms of like what has the community told us that they value and then how do we how do we take? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1993.604s">The</a> the work that is happening, which is all in one place Match that with what the community is expecting and make sure that our budget reflects those values. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2003.412s">So</a> I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2006.13s">We</a> have some work to do in terms of hearing from the community about our strategic objectives and maybe it's not about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2017.051s">asking</a> people to respond to like the nitty gritty of this plan, because I feel like the community at large may not be positioned to tell us whether they like bullet number two, but they could probably tell us what they envision for Medford Public Schools in a broader sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2034.962s">And</a> then, you know, there's some work to sort of connect all of that together that has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2039.925s">So</a> I guess when I think about the work of this committee is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2044.888s">you</a> know, and I want to open it up to my colleagues is what work should we be doing this year to engage the community in this discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2053.573s">So</a> that this is a document not only that says, like, that's a report out of what we're doing, but it is a reflection of what the community thinks that we're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2065.821s">Thoughts,</a> questions, Melanie, Kathy? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2073.24s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2747.709s">that's</a> a choice and a value that we either have or we don't, but if we have it, it does take time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2758.817s">And</a> it's sort of, it's a choice that we are making to say we value the input of the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2767.044s">And</a> I think, when I think back to all of the work that we did over the course of the reopening, like before the task force, we had a series of round tables <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2778.093s">And</a> they felt, you know, I think they always feel sort of wild and crazy the first time you do something like that, but I think they went really well and they were very well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2788.544s">And</a> I think we could easily do something like that to garner the discussion that I think is really <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2797.595s">valuable</a> in this conversation because I think it allows people to sort of share their perspective in a way that is not sort of like formed into a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2808.679s">But</a> I will also say that during that process, lots of people reached out to me and said, gee, I'd love to go, but I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2816.001s">And</a> like, why isn't there a survey for the people like me who can't attend? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2820.143s">So</a> I do think that from an engagement perspective, thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2828.005s">getting</a> the buy-in of the community around what are sort of our goals, our mission, our vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2833.687s">I</a> do think we should consider a series of roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2838.609s">It</a> doesn't have to be hundreds of roundtables or anything like that, but it, you know, we probably just need to think about like <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2844.871s">Are</a> they different by level or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2846.571s">Because</a> that was, I think, a challenge in our last set of roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2849.452s">And</a> Zoom breakout rooms have come a really long way since the wild assignment of hundreds of people that we were doing back in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2859.294s">So</a> I do think we should pursue doing something like that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2863.055s">I</a> think they were <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2866.462s">I</a> think they were meaningful and I think we learned a lot about where the community's head was at that helped inform where we wanted to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2874.627s">But</a> I do think we should consider a survey of some kind once those are over that allows us to say, this is where we are, this is what we've heard so far, and now we wanna hear from you whether or not you were able to join us for these initial round tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2893.379s">Melanie?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3514.063s">So,</a> just listening to sort of all of this discussion and thinking about strategic planning, you know the kind of strategic planning that I do in my professional life I feel like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3526.945s">I</a> think where we're going is we need a path that does not require us to boil the ocean all at one time because we have other work to do around the pandemic and lots of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3541.099s">So</a> I think if I were to think about a real simple sequence, I would say roundtables, survey, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3548.766s">then</a> a revision to these documents based on that feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3552.649s">So</a> we would wait until we collected that feedback before we would ask the administrative team to go back and flush this further because these documents are supposed to live and breathe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3566.241s">And</a> I don't want people to be burdened with lots and lots of revisions to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3571.205s">And</a> then once that third step of that revision is done, I think then the fourth, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3577.857s">layer</a> of that is like a time is timelining so to be able to say okay if this is where we're aspiring to go what does this look like a year from now and I think that's where your comments about like what is like what does this mean for next year is a really different question than what does this mean for three years from now so putting that timeline in place and saying what is what does this mean for next year what are our objectives for next year that sort of gets us to um <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3605.517s">I'll</a> say a proactive discussion of like district goals and all of that good stuff all in one shot, which would be delightful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3613.06s">But</a> I feel like, you know, perhaps we can take the same approach to like the roundtables or the listening sessions that we took last time where this group came up with the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3624.503s">work</a> together to come up with the agenda and then sort of take it from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3629.125s">The</a> one thing I will say is, you know, I think when we talk about how the format of those sessions, I want to make sure that it is the kind of thing that the entire school committee can participate in because it's really important for the school committee to be able to hear that voice of the community because we are the ones that will be faced with like things like goal setting and <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3651.495s">budgeting</a> and prioritization and resource contention inevitably. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3656.216s">So</a> I wanna make sure that the school committee is part of those, which I think de facto means they are posted public meetings, at least in some fashion, maybe not with all audiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3668.32s">So</a> what we could do is put a quick meeting on the books for later this month, since we missed our January meeting where we could flesh out an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3679.792s">and</a> then sort of revise the rest of our calendar which we can do at the end of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3686.718s">But</a> we can't, I think this committee took on that work of the initial round table and it might be a good idea for us to take a similar approach and figure out what that agenda might look like for March. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3699.048s">I</a> don't know what you all think of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3707.441s">for</a> the round tables or the listening sessions or whatever you want to call them?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=3775.15s">But</a> we want- So do we try to do the round tables in April then, and then use our March meeting to define the agenda?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4031.522s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4031.782s">And</a> I think if we, so we have a meeting scheduled for March 1st, sorry, my agenda printed like this big on each page. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4040.286s">So</a> I can barely read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4042.307s">So</a> on March 1st, we have a scheduled meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4045.008s">So</a> perhaps we use that meeting to talk about the, the plans for the April round tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4052.051s">So</a> I can take an action item to, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4055.392s">start</a> a draft of that to give us something to work with, as well as a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4060.096s">So</a> I'm happy to take on that work to put forth something that we can react to in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4066.181s">And</a> then, you know, we would do the roundtables and the surveying in April, and that would give us like the, you know, April and May to do the revision, and that final step of the timeline in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4078.27s">And</a> that gets us to a place where that aligns well with I think what you were envisioning in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4084.315s">the</a> goals for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4085.475s">And</a> I think, honestly, that's super ambitious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4089.578s">It</a> feels like you've been working on this forever, but it's also like really, really ambitious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4094.641s">It's,</a> you know, a lot, you know, there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4097.143s">So</a> I just want to be mindful of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4098.724s">But</a> if that timeline works, I think it just would require us to shift around some of the other things that we have on the upcoming agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4106.229s">But</a> I think we have the space to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4108.871s">Does</a> that sound reasonable to everybody?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4145.258s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4146.279s">Yeah,</a> I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4148.041s">So,</a> when I look at the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4151.607s">What</a> would, so what we haven't gotten to tonight, what time is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4156.771s">It's</a> 10 past six, so I think we can cover the middle school piece briefly at the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4162.796s">But</a> we can talk about, in March we can talk about the roundtables and the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4169.06s">In</a> April we had on our agenda that we were going to talk about community engagement practices where we were going to actually be <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4175.565s">sort</a> of reaching out into the community to try to understand if there are folks that we should be bringing into that conversation so we can set a more specific part of the communication strategy that we are sort of working towards as we talk about reaching audiences that we don't always reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4193.369s">So</a> I think we should leave that in place for April. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4197.37s">which</a> might be timely anyway and then move our discussion of the website to our May meeting and we can circle back around to the middle school and any remaining open items in our June meeting if that is agreeable to everybody.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4237.434s">Does</a> that sound like a plan, member Kreatz, member McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4243.335s">Okay,</a> so I will update the future meeting schedule and it'll be reflected in the minutes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4249.117s">And</a> then I will, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4250.863s">prior</a> to our March meeting, I will put together a potential starting point for the round tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4259.608s">And</a> I'll try to think back to the million years ago where we did the last ones, but we can work through the revisions of that in our March meeting, as well as I will take a crack at a simple but complete survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4275.157s">And</a> we can look at that in March as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4278.868s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4280.809s">So</a> the other topic on our agenda tonight was really around middle school orientation practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4286.633s">I</a> know we had a really good discussion about kindergarten earlier in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4292.698s">I</a> guess that was November now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4294.519s">And</a> it's great to see that the registration is out there and people are asking good questions and building bridges to kindergarten is like off to the races and that's <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4304.103s">way</a> earlier than we've ever been able to do any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4306.764s">So</a> it's like very, very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4309.226s">And</a> I think this committee has an action item around middle school orientation practices, which is in a similar vein in terms of sort of understanding our orientation and lottery timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4323.833s">I</a> don't feel like I'm a great person to speak about what we have done before because we transitioned to middle school in the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4329.714s">So</a> I have no idea what it was supposed to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4331.914s">I</a> just know how it happened last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4335.755s">But</a> I was wondering if we could talk briefly about that and just overall sort of thoughts and commentary around that transition process that happens in the spring and what you guys are anticipating for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4350.478s">And</a> then we can circle back around to that in our final meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4483.795s">Dr.</a> Cushing, before you do that, I think Kathy had her hand in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4487.738s">Kathy?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4739.441s">And</a> Dr. Edouard-Vincent, do you plan to do, like I know the last couple of years because the lottery has been so new, you did a roadshow of sorts and you were out at the different schools talking about the lottery in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4753.229s">And</a> I know that like the commentary I heard was that, you know, things, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4758.892s">the</a> nature of the questions really changed from like the several years that you have had to do this roadshow, where it's sort of more accepted practice now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4769.418s">And</a> I was wondering if you were planning to do those again, or if there's an opportunity to talk to prospective middle school parents about just middle school and not simply the lottery, but about the transition to middle school at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4785.647s">And</a> I didn't know if you guys had talked about doing something like that or not this year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4941.91s">I</a> think that would be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4943.291s">We</a> have <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4948.397s">seven</a> minutes left and there is currently a goal to leave meetings just minutes early in our subcommittee so I don't want to be the one that doesn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4961.044s">So</a> I didn't know Kathy and Melanie if you had any other questions or thoughts or comments about the middle school <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4968.207s">process</a> but certainly when we do the minutes next week we can cover the the timeline that we can make sure we I can make sure I talk about the timeline if you don't have plans to present it otherwise just so that anybody listening can hear that directly from the minutes of this meeting that if they weren't able to attend so we can do that either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=4992.455s">questions.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5008.545s">But</a> Melanie is stretching out the end of my meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5022.299s">Okay,</a> so motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5024.123s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5027.291s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5028.333s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5029.275s">Member</a> Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5030.378s">So</a> three in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=5032.864s">Meeting</a> is adjourned.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=158.536s">We</a> lost Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=160.216s">His</a> internet went out and he's rebooting, so he'll be back shortly.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1653.941s">Member</a> Graham?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1657.998s">So</a> I actually went and read the document that Kathy sent us back in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1663.121s">And</a> on page 15, it actually gives like a handy set of like procedural steps and plans, how you approach superintendent evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1675.366s">There</a> should, I mean, in any evaluation, like we should not be verbally shooting from the hip. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1681.549s">We</a> should be thoughtful and planful and, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1684.69s">I</a> don't think there's enough time in the next 25 minutes to do that myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1690.216s">But</a> this set of worksheet steps supports what I consider to be good, solid evaluation practices, which is to establish goals, which we have, which the prior committee did back in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1707.476s">And</a> then it does talk about a formative mid-cycle assessment, which I don't recall us doing in that like, I'll say formal way, but it's not required, although it is recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1720.502s">And</a> then the superintendent provides an end of cycle report, which I feel like is what we just heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1725.924s">Step</a> five is that we all receive an evaluation form. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1731.486s">And</a> the evaluation form has in it implicit the agreed upon goals and highlighted any agreed upon indicators and a copy of the rubric that is attached to this document so that we all are using level playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1747.936s">And</a> then what I think we need to do this evening is talk about the questions that they lay out in step five, which is who will compile, how will ratings be determined, how will ratings be presented, how will the narrative be composed, and what individual evaluations will be shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1765.932s">And</a> then, you know, we all have a date by which we have to submit everything to somebody, whoever that somebody is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1773.075s">Somebody</a> creates a composite evaluation, and then we have a meeting where we discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1780.077s">Step</a> eight is like final evaluation presented, discussed, and voted in a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1784.259s">So</a> that's the set of steps that they recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1789.26s">that</a> ensures our compliance with the open meeting law, which actually has gone to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as it relates to superintendent evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1798.445s">And</a> it ensures that we're all sort of using the same measuring sticks and against the same goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1805.869s">So</a> I don't personally see any reason to veer from this recommended process, but I think we should talk about like what those steps are and when we will complete them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1872.011s">Are</a> you, Member McLaughlin, are you thinking this would go to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee to be memorialized as part of our policy handbook?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1919.387s">So</a> are you interested in amending your motion to include that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1926.512s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1976.645s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2108.74s">I</a> mean, member Graham, it will take that long to for us to provide the feedback and like more importantly for whoever's compiling this like it's really. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2120.39s">It's</a> really tedious to do a good job of compiling information from seven different people into an evaluation that is cohesive and doesn't just sound like seven different streams of thought about things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2136.017s">So</a> I do think we all need to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2140.679s">um</a> quick in our you know as quick as reasonable in our own like individual feedback because then whoever is going to be the compiler of this information it's uh it's you know it's a decent amount of work to do it well and to have it come together like a single voice um in a way that is going to be meaningful feedback um to present.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2328.937s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2332.659s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2333.76s">Would</a> you like me to just type something out, Melanie?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2339.463s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2532.584s">And</a> I just put in the chat a written form of what I think we've agreed to.<h2><a href="../2021-01-25_UWldBjHqpes/2021-01-25_UWldBjHqpes.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=201.153s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4350.363s">In</a> the minutes there's a reference to the PowerPoint about the homework survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4356.405s">Can</a> that be shared with the committee?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8633.788s">Sorry,</a> I generally am sort of in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8638.253s">I</a> just had a couple of questions or thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8643.188s">My</a> first question is, I didn't see anything in the essential duties that talks about this individual needing to be able to sort of connect students and families to services available in the network around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8658.734s">And</a> I did a little bit of quick poking around at some other similar job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8662.755s">And</a> that stood out to me as something that when you're talking about re-engagement of a student who is sort of not where we want them to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8671.758s">that</a> we all sort of recognize it's probably not their fault, there's something else going on, but like we have to sort of step, I think we have to be able to step in and find some ways to fix the stuff going on or try to address or try to connect them to the people who can help them address the thing that is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8692.044s">So</a> I would love to see us add that to the essential duties that that person can be expected to <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8700.847s">sort</a> of help with that like support net in terms of connecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8706.349s">And</a> we've talked before about like, is their family signed up for free reduced lunch? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8710.451s">Like</a> what are all the things that they require in order to sort of get on a more sustainable path forward to graduation? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8721.175s">So</a> I think that would be a really meaningful addition to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8727.919s">And</a> then the other thing that jumped out at me is in the credentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8731.04s">I</a> would like to see us remove criminal justice and law enforcement as a thing we're specifically calling out that we're looking for a degree in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8741.484s">So</a> I don't think it means we couldn't embrace a candidate that has a degree in criminal justice, but given how progressive this is otherwise, <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8755.718s">I</a> don't think we're gaining anything by calling that out except scrutiny about whether this is just window dressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8762.764s">And</a> I don't believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8764.246s">So</a> perhaps there's a way for us to remove that before we post the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8770.872s">And</a> then my other question was whether you have talked at all about what role, if any, this individual plays as we think about implementing our out-of-school suspension policy, and is there connectivity there or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8788.742s">That</a> just didn't jump out at me one way or the other.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=9181.829s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10031.988s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10033.369s">Thanks</a> for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10034.31s">Um</a> as I'm digesting this, I guess I have a couple of thoughts rolling through my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10039.454s">So</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10048.371s">for</a> all intents and purposes, practically over. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10051.112s">So</a> it's a little bit awkward to be talking about goals now because whatever they might be, there's very little time to actually execute on them unless you've already done the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10062.377s">And</a> then it looks like we're just saying yes to the things you've already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10066.419s">So</a> the timing of this conversation is a little bit weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10072.061s">So</a> I do think that a lot of the things that have <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10075.623s">take</a> in just an enormous amount of time from a district-wide planning perspective belong in that first category, but I would like to see us think about what are our objectives to be contained in this school year that will allow us to be more prepared than we were in August, September of last year for the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10098.84s">So</a> I would like to see something added that is forward-looking that is yet to be accomplished and <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10105.468s">I'm</a> not suggesting that we've sort of checked the box and everything that's already there, because I know it's sort of a constant evolution, no shortage of work, but I do think we should think about something there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10117.7s">And</a> then I think the other thing that is sort of rattling around in my head is when I think about math, I just have some real questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10128.368s">The</a> continued viability of this being our district wide goal our district wide goal, I mean when I think about where we're at right now, like we have an elementary school math curriculum that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10140.105s">we're</a> considering replacing that you know by by lots of accounts doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10145.273s">And</a> yet, we're expecting the results to change in some significant fashion and I just don't think that's possible like there's, there's just not enough gain to eat out of the system without foundational support that aligns with where we're trying to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10163.08s">We</a> have this like, we've always used MCAS as an assessment tool to sort of quantify this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10170.405s">And</a> I think the point of this goal is that it is quantifiable and that's gonna be challenging in general this year because of where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10181.471s">And</a> then I think about literacy and I think about the fact that we have been doing assessment in the literacy space <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10193.772s">for</a> like last year and then continuing into this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10199.553s">It</a> doesn't have the sort of energy or wrapped up in it that MCAS does. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10206.135s">So</a> people have very strong feelings about the MCAS this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10209.455s">So</a> even if it goes, what the data will tell us, I think is up for question and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10216.277s">But</a> those early literacy assessments, like I've not heard people recoiling against <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10221.358s">the</a> literacy assessments that we're doing for some of our youngest learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10227.081s">And</a> I do think about, you know, when we talk about district-wide effectiveness, when we talk about students that need support from the district, not just in those early days, but in an ongoing fashion, is math the reason they need <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10244.738s">support</a> or is it literacy that is sort of at the base of our struggle? <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10250.043s">So</a> I guess having said all that, it is the end of January and sort of changing gears in terms of focus is problematic to be doing at this point in the year, but I just can't see myself being super supportive of continuing to go after <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10271.167s">math</a> MCAS scores, knowing that the foundation is sort of not where it needs to be to help get us there, and knowing that we have this like sort of pressing need from a literacy perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10283.372s">So</a> I'm also in favor of not voting on this tonight because I feel pretty conflicted about where this is versus sort of where I would like to see us be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10506.736s">Yeah,</a> and as I said, I recognize that it's practically February and now is a really unfair time to shift the goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10515.421s">So</a> I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10519.523s">And</a> I think it's just more like a general frustration that we're sort of in this situation where we don't actually have the ability to have a real goals discussion because we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10529.508s">But</a> having said that, I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10533.82s">you</a> know, when we talk about some of the things that are happening between now and the end of the year, really thinking about how will we assess <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10543.439s">the</a> impact of these last two years on our students so that next year we're prepared to sort of take action is something I would like to see there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10554.548s">And</a> I cannot fathom any support I would have for not prioritizing literacy as part of your goals starting next year at minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10563.394s">So</a> I just <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10566.323s">I,</a> okay, if there's more than one goal, but I don't think we can bypass literacy for too much longer for lots of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10576.067s">So,</a> and I think if we really think about like how kids are gonna get left behind in all of this, I'm really worried about those young learners and the, you know, teaching literacy two days a week and over Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10590.392s">And</a> it's just incredibly, <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10592.906s">It's</a> incredibly hard and I would totally defer to you all on what those measures are and metrics are and sort of where we're at, but that's sort of what my thinking is right now, but I do support us revisiting this next time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10982.477s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11695.546s">Is</a> there already a second on this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13264.154s">Just</a> as a point of information, at the beginning of the pandemic, when we were having issues around canceling field trips, we referred something to the rules policy and equity subcommittee to revisit how we procure insurance for large field trips, and whether <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13285.179s">those</a> practices are in alignment with what we would want to see in these circumstances where we've had we had to pursue refunds. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13292.643s">So</a> you remember we had to get attorney Greenspan to engage and you know get students money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13300.687s">So</a> I just wanted to make a reminder that that it was out in the ether and that perhaps if we're going to talk about field trips we can dedicate a meeting to that and that can also resurface. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13315.135s">as</a> an important conversation.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13323.98s">Perfect.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-01-13_149wJZ-aHMk/2021-01-13_149wJZ-aHMk.html">Rules and Policy Subcommittee Meeting - January</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=434.677s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2009.657s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2011.919s">I</a> did have a question about the enrollment report, which I've been like waving my hand like a crazy person all this time and nobody could clearly see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2020.285s">So</a> we have talked on a number of occasions about, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2028.368s">desiring,</a> wanting, needing information about our charter school enrollments and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2035.049s">And</a> we don't have any visibility into that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2038.05s">I'm</a> not suggesting necessarily that that is part of the enrollment report because the enrollment report means something very specific to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2047.232s">But</a> on this same frequency, I believe that we should have visibility into how many students we are paying to send to charter schools from Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2058.174s">So</a> and I what I don't know, I don't think it necessarily has to be at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2062.335s">But</a> I think, you know, on a similar interval, that is a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2066.757s">And</a> I was looking back to the old list of reports that was definitely on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2073.179s">And</a> that really should be presented to us because it has significant budget impacts.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2104.479s">I'm</a> just looking at an old agenda.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2128.707s">I</a> also think when you talk about the enrollment report, <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2135.082s">You</a> know, whatever Jesse is requires is one thing, but I think from a from a usefulness perspective for for us and really for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2144.746s">I</a> think our enrollment reports really should reflect <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2150.049s">some</a> number of years of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2153.512s">So,</a> you know, I don't know if that's the same report. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2156.295s">And</a> I feel like you can get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2158.458s">You</a> got to go digging around on the DESE website. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2161.661s">But</a> you'll will we regularly hear in the community people making assumptions about our enrollment <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2172.15s">being</a> one thing or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2173.511s">And</a> we shouldn't have to like dig or even spend a minute to ask somebody for something special to be able to answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2183.475s">It</a> should just be really clear, like, you know, has our enrollment changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2187.637s">Yes</a> or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2188.357s">And</a> it should be just one of those things that's available on the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2193.759s">And</a> if it can all be kind of pulled together at the same time, I think that will allow everyone sort of that opportunity to understand our <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2202.433s">our</a> current context as it relates to like past history. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2206.596s">So</a> when we talk about budget changes versus enrollment versus all those other things, having some sort of historical data there, I think would be really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2220.246s">So</a> that may move it like really far from like the DSEE report in terms of its creation, I don't know, but I think it would be very useful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2435.272s">It's</a> pretty common to see a draft and then expect the auditor to issue a final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2443.094s">So</a> I could see why both of those things would be listed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2719.257s">I</a> actually think of community schools as a report because it should include our current rates for the various things that we offer, our fee structures for athletics, everything else that goes through community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2737.928s">It</a> should include some description of everything that flows into and out of that revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2744.713s">So</a> this is one of those places where <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2748.188s">those</a> revolving accounts are very murky at best. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2753.052s">And</a> I've only ever heard and not, we haven't talked about it recently, but I've only ever heard people say it's complicated and that is not good enough when we are responsible for public funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2765.863s">So</a> getting to a point of clarity around that, I think that to me, community schools is like a legitimate report with lots of data on it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2945.672s">The</a> other thing that I would wanna know every time I've ever seen a PD report, it's just sort of a list of classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2955.156s">I'm</a> also interested in our compliance rate when we identify something as mandatory and our participation rates for optional classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2965.9s">So,</a> we talked in the curriculum subcommittee meeting recently about some professional development that's being offered by <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2974.863s">um</a> massachusetts partnership for you no um suzanna campbell um and i think that's really important work but it's optional pd so for us to say that we are offering it um my question is really about like <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=2996.034s">it's</a> fine if it's optional and we have really high participation, we're not meeting our objectives if it's optional and we have no participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3003.26s">So</a> even for things that are optional, particularly because I think there's a lot of really important things that end up in the optional bucket given the structure of our, or the availability of how much PD time we have in our calendar and in our contract, I think it's really important to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3022.514s">where</a> the participation is so that we can make good decisions about funding and prioritization of those kinds of things when we're trying to figure out what those goals are and how we move forward to meet them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3512.031s">And</a> the only thing I would say about the timing of, and maybe it applies for community schools as well, is we should be voting to set rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3523.878s">So</a> that annual cadence should be in advance enough that the school committee can formally vote <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3532.665s">on</a> the rates which Howard said we should be doing and we haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3537.368s">So</a> we need to do it before the rates are set and communicated out. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3542.191s">And</a> I know with afterschool in particular, it's a big deal to get that registration out. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3548.736s">I</a> mean, we've talked about it in our kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3552.678s">work</a> and other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3554.398s">So</a> I know there's just a timeline there that we need to be watchful of so that those rates can be set well in advance of the rollout, which seems like it's getting earlier and earlier every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3567.621s">So</a> just that one in particular has a timing implication. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3571.882s">Community</a> schools maybe isn't quite so early in the year, but also time sensitive if we're talking about rate setting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3901.372s">I</a> think that's the PTO registration, Emily K. Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3906.856s">Oh,</a> yes.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4102.764s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4104.005s">I</a> muted myself because the printer was going and then evidently I was stuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4108.547s">I</a> have several other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4109.547s">Do</a> you want me just to send them to you since we're out of time or?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4118.972s">Three.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4121.84s">Okay,</a> the first one we talked about kindergarten enrollment reporting in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4127.683s">And</a> again, to look at that comparatively over time in terms of like where we are with kindergarten enrollment in June of every year, as well as, you know, sort of where we are in June versus where we land in maybe October or something like that to be able to sort of fill out the history of what our kindergarten enrollment looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4152.815s">I</a> would also like to make sure that we add a summary of our early literacy testing results. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4164.341s">So</a> we are testing K to two students. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4169.704s">Is</a> it three times a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4170.945s">And</a> we, <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4176.149s">we</a> should be receiving results from each of those testing periods so that we can be informed about where the results are at, is progress being made, report over report, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4189.163s">And</a> then the final thing I have, which is maybe something that would only be able to be shared in executive session, but I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4198.152s">um</a> feel like we have any visibility into the number of grievances that are filed by our union membership um and since we are the holders of those contracts um I think we need to have some sort of visibility into like are we you know is it one grievance is it a hundred grievances um so we obviously like need to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4222.414s">navigate</a> the details carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4224.138s">But</a> as we talk about contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4230.407s">management</a> and hygiene, like if we have contracts where we have high numbers of grievances, those are sort of indicators that we should be watching as a school committee and the holder of those contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4239.651s">So</a> some sort of report of grievances and like, I don't know, maybe it's just, are they settling for the member or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4250.755s">And</a> is there maybe some sort of categorization or something that would help us be informed <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4258.115s">as</a> we think about go forward negotiations.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4304.447s">Um</a> yeah, I know we have a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4306.008s">Do</a> we have a committee of the whole and a half an hour? <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4308.209s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4309.129s">Um</a> Can we just, um Anticipate that we will have more <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4316.723s">Visitors</a> to that meeting and be prepared for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4320.186s">Yeah,</a> there's something I can do to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4321.507s">Let</a> me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4322.407s">Yes,</a> we're definitely going to be ready for the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=4325.27s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=256.294s">So</a> I say the name of the person I am nominating, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=262.054s">that</a> I'm voting for?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=268.118s">No,</a> I'm just asking about, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=270.14s">So</a> Paulette Van der Kloot.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=361.32s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=364.302s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=366.814s">Member</a> Kreatz.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=369.055s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2675.92s">Sorry,</a> I thought I did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2679.002s">When</a> you talk about pooling folks, has there been discussion about pooling siblings in the same pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2688.467s">I</a> know that's obviously can't be done like cross building, but is there a way to pool families within a building so that at least they're not sort of getting potentially snared by multiple pools?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2855.82s">Okay,</a> that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2859.403s">Thanks</a> for that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2860.743s">And</a> you also said earlier that our participation is good, but it is not 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2868.788s">What</a> percent is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2871.39s">It</a> is...
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2929.585s">And</a> has there been discussion across districts or with other superintendents about making this kind of testing mandatory as a condition for in-person learning? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2943.894s">And</a> what's your thinking about that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3091.689s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3092.67s">I</a> if for those who are listening, I, I can't request strongly enough that everyone participate in this program like we are so lucky to have this program in Medford, I get emails every day from school committees across the state that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3108.868s">They</a> have to go full remote because they just can't figure out, they can't isolate how their case counts are happening, where it's happening in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3118.373s">And</a> they just have no choice but to make these really broad brush decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3122.654s">And</a> I think we've been really lucky here that we can make really targeted decisions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3130.038s">And</a> if you haven't signed up for testing yet, please do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3135.36s">it</a> is life-saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3136.28s">It</a> may not save your life, but it may save somebody else's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3139.561s">So</a> please seriously consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3143.381s">And</a> then the last question that I have.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3178.461s">And</a> then my last question about testing is whether cohort D families can test this week.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7914.179s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7914.861s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about where the task force is at regarding the equity audit and how you're planning to approach that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8171.492s">And</a> is it the plan that this equity audit would be conducted by an external party?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8178.574s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8182.398s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8183.822s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8186.61s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8569.434s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8570.034s">So</a> the one thing that I would say if we do decide to move forward is that we passed a resolution earlier this year to sort of build a complete communication strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8581.337s">And</a> one of the key elements of that strategy is family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8585.438s">So</a> I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8586.978s">We</a> are well positioned to be able to say like, we, we know we need to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8592.802s">We</a> are trying to get this work started and this would be like a great fit for us so I feel like from an application perspective there's probably a great way to integrate some of that work that we are doing as part as part of the communication engagement and strategic planning subcommittee already. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8609.131s">And</a> I know we have an upcoming meeting slated for this very topic, I think in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8615.934s">So</a> which is obviously like probably one of many meetings that we'll have on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8620.756s">So</a> I just wanted to reinforce that this committee unanimously supported that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8628.679s">And</a> I think that would make us really attractive.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=9038.617s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2020-12-17_VEO0m0tZkkY/2020-12-17_VEO0m0tZkkY.html">COW Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1025.313s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1027.08s">So</a> I think when we disbanded this committee, we talked about the fact that, you know, one of the, you know, among the challenges in the way that the committee was formed is that we did not have a diverse cross section of residents participating, but that really that was because we weren't following our own rules about how to establish such a committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1050.9s">I</a> think we need to go back to the beginning of that process and say, which is what we agreed we would do, and say, what is the scope of this committee that we're asking? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1061.702s">And</a> therefore, how many people do we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1064.483s">And</a> what is the time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1065.803s">And</a> what do we expect from them? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1067.304s">And</a> what parameters are we providing to them so that they can then go off and do their exploratory <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1073.743s">work,</a> whatever that work might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1075.743s">But</a> it would be hugely irresponsible of this committee to say, we just because we have done stuff in recent times that we shouldn't at least examine what all of our options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1088.145s">Because</a> when you are retrofitting a building, it is often far more expensive than something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1094.887s">Sometimes</a> it's not, but none of us is qualified to make that decision, but none of us is qualified to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1100.247s">So</a> we should, I think we need to proceed with <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1104.1s">plans</a> that we had in place to sort of examine those as options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1107.422s">So</a> what Mr. Brown presented to us back at that meeting because I was in attendance was that there's really three options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1115.367s">One</a> is to renovate in place and to do that a little bit at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1119.63s">That's</a> one option. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1121.051s">The</a> other was to build something new on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1126.675s">So</a> basically stand up a new structure and then ultimately the current one goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1132.038s">The</a> third option was <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1134.404s">not</a> to build on site at all, but to find some other site or location and explore what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1141.672s">And</a> I think each of those three things at this point in time, based on what we don't know, are just as viable as the last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1152.133s">I</a> think, you know, in terms of the scope of the committee, we need to not limit them and we need to, as a committee, not limit our thinking about how we're going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1162.279s">And</a> I hear that all the time when the discussion of vision committee comes up is people say, well, we did this work six years ago, so we can't possibly consider doing something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1171.684s">I</a> think that's an expensive assumption potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1175.507s">And</a> I don't feel like we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1178.204s">rolling</a> in dough as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1179.985s">So</a> we owe it to the community to make really astute, smart decisions about what's in the best interest of our vision, which we don't have at the moment, and how we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1191.469s">So</a> I do think if we go back to the beginning of forming an advisory committee and talk about the scope, that will lead us to questions like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1200.069s">just</a> how big should the committee be, who should be on the committee, what kind of skills do we need, and then we can get to the point of how do we have an application process that allows us to ensure that we have a representative group of people on the various components of the committee to do the work that we have asked them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1221.169s">a</a> framing of the work and an expectation of what we need from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1224.632s">I</a> think it's really hard to expect people to just blindly sign up for something where we can't say it's this many hours, it's this many months, it's this much time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1235.059s">And</a> I think there's a lot of facets to this process that perhaps the committee needs to be quite large because there need to be subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1242.625s">And</a> I think that's what we should be talking about today, not about whether or not we are gonna do X or Y or Z because none of us is qualified to make those decisions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3152.973s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3155.555s">It's</a> been a long day of Zooming. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3156.836s">So</a> I was also thinking about some of the things that I heard in the original, in the last process, where I heard people say things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3167.612s">I</a> wasn't sure what the time commitment was. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3170.915s">So</a> I didn't sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3173.697s">And</a> then I also heard people who were selected who were like, I still don't know what I signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3178.521s">And</a> like, I may or may not be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3180.863s">So</a> I think it is important for us to like come up with that, that sort of charge, as well as some, some sort of rough sketch of how <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3194.393s">we</a> think the committee needs to be comprised and where is the balance of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3200.752s">the</a> person who really wants to be involved but cannot come to a meeting every single week, maybe there's a role for them versus the person who has a background in environmental science building schools and like what we would want from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3213.34s">So</a> I do think even if it means our application doesn't go out until the end of February, honestly, I think it's worth our investment to like take the time to sort of spec that out, this group and really <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3228.073s">be</a> on the same page about what we're asking the group to do, how we envision that the group will operate, because I think it needs to be bigger than it was, but as soon as you get bigger than it was, you have to have some substructures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3244.222s">And</a> maybe we can have some of that discussion to sort of provide that guidance and then send out the application so that there really is like a place for everybody to <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3257.151s">feel</a> like there's a home for them to participate without having to blindly say, yes, I have an unlimited number of hours to give to Medford public schools so I think I'd rather us take the time in January and even if it goes into February to get that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3272.959s">right</a> and like sort of like staked out in some fashion so that when we send the application out we can both be clear about what what we're asking the larger committee to do and also maybe there are sub jobs that we're trying to find people to fill but also that we can have a clear message at that time about <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3296.115s">that</a> we are committed to having more voices than just the people on the committee and this is how we will do it and there, you know, I think we found in the reopening task force there were a good number of people uniquely interested in the communications piece of what needed to happen and they were, it was a great group so <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3312.82s">um</a> you know maybe there's a way for us to make sure that we are being clear about all the like various things that we think we need before that application goes out the door and I think honestly like we're probably not going to be in a position to be like lots of on-site activity in large groups between now and then anyway so I think we just maybe use the time to to do that right up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3336.496s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3336.897s">Member</a> McLaughlin then Member Van der Kloot.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3857.555s">I</a> was actually gonna suggest that we not put that on the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3861.717s">She</a> has lots of things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3865.378s">But,</a> and you know, we've talked extensively about like how many things we're asking the superintendent to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3871.581s">And</a> I think this is an example of something that as a committee, we could say, you know, there's like, I don't know, there's three or four pieces of this and could individual committee members take a shot at it <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3882.182s">and</a> bring something to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3883.823s">I</a> think that's a really fair way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3887.224s">As</a> long as the committee agrees with that approach, I don't see why we can't each individual, you know, take a part and write something down. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3896.868s">So</a> there's something to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3898.028s">I,</a> you know, I think it would be luxurious for Maurice to have the time to have a half hour conversation with each of us about our wants and our needs, but you know, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3909.731s">she</a> has really pressing things to do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3912.533s">So</a> I would be happy to take on a piece of the work, but I want to make sure that the entire committee is on board with who's going to do what and that it's just simply a draft and a starting point so we can have a productive conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3927.725s">So</a> that's just another idea.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4780.827s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4782.087s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4782.827s">I'm</a> going to take Scott's sweater. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4784.707s">He's</a> got a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4785.428s">It</a> lights up.<h2><a href="../2020-12-10_P1mOngMoa2g/2020-12-10_P1mOngMoa2g.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting - Math</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2562.016s">I'm</a> muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2562.596s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2563.517s">Member</a> Ruseau, I think I saw that you had your hand in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2565.818s">I</a> have some questions as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2797.032s">I</a> had some questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2798.974s">So</a> I'm gonna go ahead and ask them now, because I don't see any other hands in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2804.759s">So</a> Faiza, I know that the work that you were doing around elementary school math <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2810.46s">was</a> an effort to evaluate the replacement of envisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2815.161s">And</a> obviously that's sort of waylaid, but like envisions gets pretty terrible marks in the curriculum world. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2825.783s">And</a> by the time this is done, we will have lost an entire like school full of elementary school students to a curriculum that isn't even up to standard <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2839.664s">minimally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2840.344s">So</a> I just feel like that makes the teachers have to work that much harder to sort of cover the gap, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2846.748s">So</a> if the curriculum can't stand on its own, then the teachers are faced with having to fill the gap or you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2854.451s">And</a> I'm not particularly sure like what we would do about that, except that I think we need to temper our expectation that <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2868.29s">any</a> sort of math outcomes would change unless we are willing to change our foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2875.272s">So</a> I've been thinking a lot about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2879.994s">One</a> of the things that we talked about in terms of this work of the curriculum subcommittee is that we would ultimately create a catalog that would include things like program expiration dates, because it's definitely my sense that <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2895.964s">sort</a> of behind our expiration dates at this point where we should, you know, in a more perfect world, we would be making these evaluations before our programs expire. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2905.068s">And</a> we're faced with, you know, really, we're going to be asking the community to pay for a program to extend next year that we know isn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2915.212s">And,</a> you know, it is a pandemic and <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2918.295s">I'm</a> not really sure what we can do about it in this moment except to say we don't want to be in that situation again and how do we sort of have different rigor so that we get to a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2931.9s">You</a> know one thing that we talked about and as part of the approved motion is that this catalog would include not just the program, but also those expiration dates, so that it's a really easy visual to look at and say this is this is the date that we're working towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2950.192s">as</a> well as whether the curriculum has EL or IEP supplements and whether we have purchased them because it's my understanding that like in history, we haven't always purchased all those supplements. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2963.722s">And</a> sometimes it's that they don't exist and sometimes it's that we didn't buy them. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2967.085s">So</a> just to start to create that catalog that makes that super clear, not just at the elementary level, but sort of across the board, I think makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2978.233s">And</a> I think you have the, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2979.926s">the</a> beginnings and sort of the guts of that here in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2984.189s">And</a> then I think my question about some of the high school stuff really goes more toward the <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2996.56s">another</a> approved motion that is sitting in this committee that isn't necessarily the subject of today, but the subject of math progression and best practices around math progression, especially as you like move from middle to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3008.723s">So</a> I just don't want us to lose sight of that important conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3013.464s">And</a> I would love to <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3015.784s">have</a> a meeting dedicated to that topic because I just heard from a friend today that she's got a middle schooler and the math teacher is talking to her about like what she needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3024.669s">So</a> her child ends up in calculus and I thought of you immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3028.05s">So</a> I was like, I, I really want to like circle back to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3034.033s">So</a> I would, I think I would be really interested in that conversation, which is obviously not the posted reason for today, but <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3041.877s">What</a> I couldn't tell from this presentation and maybe like when we create that catalog, it would be more clear is for the various courses and the textbooks, where are we in terms of like renewal, if renewal is a thing when it comes to like high school textbooks versus like elementary programs and like what should be our priority order <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3070.951s">as</a> we think about planning and budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3074.114s">So</a> I know that was like a lot of thoughts, but I think my question is like, what's your perspective on like how we do a better job to sort of plan proactively rather than being in this situation that I think you find yourself in fairly new to the job and we all find ourselves in saying we're gonna spend money on things we don't believe are gonna work and we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3099.492s">having</a> to do extensions when they may or may not serve our students.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4095.602s">I</a> don't, but there are a good number of community members here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4099.665s">And</a> I just didn't know if any of you had questions for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4103.707s">Khan.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4107.841s">If</a> you just want to throw your hand in the air, we'd be happy to take them.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4212.471s">The</a> investigations people must have heard we were talking today, Faiza.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4282.456s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4282.936s">And</a> Ingrid has her hand up Ingrid.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4484.24s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4485.3s">Kahn,</a> I know that some of the math curricula are increasingly reliant on technology, which probably when you did this initial view, our technology situation was considerably different than it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4500.805s">So,</a> there aren't that many silver linings in this pandemic, but being able to evaluate curricula <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4513.026s">knowing</a> that we are a one-to-one device district. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4518.354s">I'm</a> hoping that that sort of opens the doors for you all to really say, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4524.447s">this</a> is what our students and teachers need and not feel constrained by like what we may or may not have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4534.255s">So</a> my request as you do that is that you don't rule anything out for any reason that if there are resources that are implicit in the success of a program that we just have a conversation about what those are but <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4551.103s">I</a> think like we did with the science curriculum with FOSS, you know, I sat in on some of those vendor interviews way back when, and there was definite concern about our district's ability slash willingness to like buy the consumables year over year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4572.193s">And</a> I'm so glad that that did not get in the way of the choice that we made because by all accounts, like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4579.935s">the</a> program is really strong, and I know it also is hampered by the pandemic, but I'm so glad that that concern, even though valid and historically accurate, did not get in the way of Mr. Seery coming forward and saying, this is the right curriculum for us, let's do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4603.264s">And</a> so I would just encourage you not to be encumbered by, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4608.37s">whatever</a> thing may hold back a math curriculum, whatever that is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5029.072s">I</a> think the big things are to make sure that where we can, that we're, because part of the motion talked about being able to post all this information on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5043.623s">And</a> that sort of ties into some of the other things we've been talking about around like when kindergarten families are coming to like look at the district, what can they see? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5052.27s">What</a> can they click? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5053.271s">What</a> can they, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5055.453s">Go</a> to to get an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5056.955s">I</a> mean, I think that's not just kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5058.357s">That's,</a> you know, lots of different people would go looking for that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5061.861s">So,</a> you know, any information about The name of the program or textbook and and Pfizer, I can send you an email with these things in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5072.675s">If</a> that's helpful, but <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5075.261s">You</a> know, when we purchased them, I think ultimately what I would envision is that it would have a column that says this is when we last reviewed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5084.727s">So</a> I would like to see us be able to sort of demonstrate to the community that we're reviewing this stuff on a regular basis, like whatever that policy is, which this subcommittee will have to circle around to at some point this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5098.216s">but</a> like what is our policy for curriculum review and like what what does that look like so that the school committee is getting and the community is getting some sort of regular feedback from you all saying we've reviewed this we're still happy with it or we've reviewed this and this needs to go up on the block for you know consideration next time around. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5119.034s">As</a> well as, you know, like I said, any sort of link out to the resources that are available for people to either understand the curriculum or access things, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5128.701s">So</a> if there's online access, which obviously <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5132.481s">Maybe</a> we wouldn't have cared so much about like a year and a half ago, but now it's really, really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5138.866s">And</a> then the other things that we talked about in the motion, Paulette, was whether the curriculum has EL or IEP supplements. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5149.155s">And</a> if we are using them, and if we're not, what are we doing instead to serve those populations of our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5161.842s">I</a> don't know if that's even as applicable in math, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5165.148s">Kahn,</a> or if it's more of an ELA type. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5169.742s">extension.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5181.549s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5181.97s">I</a> was just not sure whether the, the textbook companies provided like purchasable extensions like that, um, in, in math in the same way that I know that they do on the ELA side. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5196.399s">Um,</a> and then, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5201.675s">you</a> know, any sort of feedback about the expiration date of whatever the piece is, and if it's sort of a candidate for replacement, when are we sort of envisioning that happening so we can start to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5217.645s">in</a> math, this is what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5219.786s">And</a> at the elementary level, like across subjects, this is what's coming because at the elementary level, like teachers don't have the bandwidth to absorb many, many new curricula at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5231.472s">So</a> if Pfizer wants to do something, that means Dr. Chiesa can't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5238.975s">Because</a> there's just only so much time in the day to absorb new curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5245.319s">and</a> do the proper amount of professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5247.243s">So</a> just thinking through that at the elementary level, I feel like it looks very different than it does at the secondary level, but I think the same like chart structure would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5257.773s">cases.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5562.137s">So</a> Dr. Edouard-Vincent, I was thinking about this presentation as it was going sort of envisioning that you would sort of looking for a model to repeat as we go through all the different catalog, the catalog areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5577.127s">And</a> I, I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5581.483s">This,</a> this is, you know, I'm sensitive to how much work this is for the departments to put together so I think one piece of feedback I would have is, I don't need as much sort of history about how we align to common core and there's Jesse and frameworks like <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5597.903s">I</a> feel like that's a common story, which maybe we should tell once or maybe in a summary, but I just don't want all the department heads spending time crafting the history side of things, because I know they just have a lot of other things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5615.014s">But</a> I did really appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5618.544s">the</a> sort of comments about where we are, what we're looking at in the right now time. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5624.567s">And</a> then maybe it, you know, in my head, it's like, it's that plus the actual catalog. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5634.911s">And</a> we're sort of covering a lot of bases with that preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5640.413s">And</a> maybe that gets to be like a lighter lift for the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5643.414s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5645.69s">I</a> definitely, I don't personally want people spending lots and lots of time crafting slides about history because I think I want us to be able to focus on like, where are we right now and how do we move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5658.28s">So</a> that's just my input.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5748.315s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think it's great to have a nice to have, but like, maybe not in the like need to have category for the other departments, you know, I mean, like, I think in a perfect world, yeah, you'd have all of those things in one handy place. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5762.225s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5763.045s">Like</a> if the department heads are pressed for time, and I just sort of assume everyone is, and we're trying to squeeze it all in, I feel like that's a really reasonable compromise in the right now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5907.852s">And</a> I can do a longer meeting if that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5942.615s">I</a> don't I think this was really helpful and I think this will be a really good framework to use as we go through this process, and I think it will be particularly helpful at budget time when. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5955.784s">You</a> know, I think it just will help us sort of eliminate surprises of. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5960.778s">Oh,</a> we have five textbooks this year that we have to plan and budget for and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5965.059s">So</a> I think this was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5966.42s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6074.727s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6075.929s">All</a> right, I have a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6080.455s">Oh,</a> Paulette, you're on mute.<h2><a href="../2020-12-09_z_Dmi-XNyWI/2020-12-09_z_Dmi-XNyWI.html">Rules, Policy & Equity Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=650.861s">My</a> only thought was when we say events associated with Medford Public Schools, how like wide of a net are we casting with that language? <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=664.227s">It</a> felt like it could be open to interpretation. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=666.348s">So</a> I just wasn't sure whether that was okay or really not okay.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=782.318s">And</a> I also, as I was reading through it, I was struggling with the two lists to think about the calendar and sequence in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=793.351s">But</a> I know why it was done this way, because we can't necessarily lock in on when certain things occur if they're on the variable dates list. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=802.797s">But</a> I'm assuming that when we publish the school calendar, like this list of observances would be with actual dates in sequence as part of that communication.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=863.919s">should</a> not be a no school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=865.32s">No,</a> it had an N in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=866.58s">That</a> is not a no school day.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=888.048s">And</a> I think that's one of those places where like obviously it's variable in a number of ways, like whether a primary is planned or not, I think varies from year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=903.618s">There</a> was at least one year where the September primary like fell on like the first day of school for kindergartners or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=912.624s">So</a> stuff like that I think would be important to just have it be <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=917.318s">in</a> mind as we are planning the school calendar?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=970.952s">But</a> I would think that when we publish the list each year that we would actually write those into some best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=978.858s">Like,</a> I mean, we know if there's a November election, we may not know about primaries, but we may when we publish. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=987.063s">So</a> depending on the year cycle it is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1075.963s">In</a> an earlier meeting, my background noise was my dog running to the window and slamming her face on the window because she wanted to be outside with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1085.61s">So</a> that was also background.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1436.761s">And</a> I just had a question related to Juneteenth. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1442.285s">So</a> I know that we took a vote about Juneteenth, but did we vote to observe it or did we vote to have it be a no school day?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1503.131s">I'm</a> just looking at the article. <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1504.571s">It</a> is a recognized state holiday.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1607.202s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1607.662s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/z_Dmi-XNyWI&t=1609.904s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2020-12-08_vMv1Z56Vk1s/2020-12-08_vMv1Z56Vk1s.html">Regular School Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=275.75s">So</a> on November 10th, the Communications Engagement and Strategic Planning Subcommittee met from 530 to 630, and we specifically discussed the practices around kindergarten orientation, both current and possible, I guess I'll say. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=296.946s">And</a> during that meeting, we talked a little bit about sort of our current process, and this has been added to the minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=306.589s">And</a> Susie did update everyone's folders, sorry, earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=313.953s">The</a> current process that we have operated under for a long time starts with registration in March, and then presentations called Bridges to Kindergarten in March and April, a visiting day in May, and then kindergarten screenings in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=335.399s">We</a> looked at that and we actually took a look at practices in our neighboring districts because, as you remember, this came up because we back in February hadn't started our orientation yet per the typical schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=351.168s">And</a> in particular, the charter schools were already asking people to make decisions about enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=357.877s">Um,</a> so we spent this meeting sort of deep diving on, um, what various, um, communities around us and, um, including the charter schools are doing, um, based on information that was publicly available. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=371.381s">Um,</a> and in general, most, I'll say most are many communities and certainly, um, the charter schools who, um, take students from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=383.332s">all</a> get their process going quite early in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=386.995s">Some</a> of them really early. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=389.597s">One</a> of the charter schools first lottery is on January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=393.601s">So</a> they are moving and grooving long before we have historically started our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=401.828s">So</a> we talked a little bit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=403.169s">We</a> talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=405.549s">some</a> of the options that we might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=408.591s">And</a> we heard from some folks in the community around certainly like what a weird year this past year was, but also the sort of necessity that came out of it being that we now have online registration, which we have never had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=425.205s">And</a> that gives us sort of a unique opportunity to do something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=429.288s">We</a> did talk about ways to promote <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=433.331s">what</a> we do in kindergarten, whether it's because of COVID and limiting, you know, the ability to gather people in person or just in general to be able to provide a deeper, richer content and collateral like out on the website and in the community so that when people are <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=451.387s">starting</a> to sort of do their research and think about what is it that Medford public schools can offer that there's sort of answers to those common questions and we had a couple of community members join us and they spoke specifically about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=464.735s">Some</a> of the things that that they saw and that they were interested in learning more about when they were in the early stages of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=473.971s">We</a> also talked about how how we reach families. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=478.516s">So</a> we typically or historically have waited for families to come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=483.241s">And</a> one of the things we talked about in the meeting and agreed on is that we would actually work with City Hall to do some outbound <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=492.271s">communication</a> to families who have eligible students to make sure that they know about Medford Public Schools, that they know that we are excited to have their students join us, and really to start that communication process with outreach and outbound over and above sort of our typical tactics of reaching people through local preschools or through the Medford Family Network, which we would continue to want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=519.995s">Um,</a> we did also talk about, um, sort of understanding the process and, um, feedback from the community as we, um, as we go through, as we go through this, um, this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=537.289s">And</a> I'll say sort of in summary, what we, what we landed on was, um, some revisions to our timeline, um, that we would start with our family mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=549.423s">And</a> as well as with trying to create some sort of video that starts to socialize kindergarten for families in the month of December, so that's this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=560.312s">And</a> just to really outline the registration process, what to expect and how people can learn more about MPS without having to <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=571.184s">only</a> gather their information from social media, friends, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=575.768s">So</a> really making sure that we're trying to reach folks in an official capacity as well as through what is invaluable in terms of personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=587.957s">We</a> talked about also focusing in the month of December on outreaching to community resources like the MFN, as well as some of the local preschools to let them know that our registration timelines are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=601.154s">And</a> then we talked about, you know, December and January doing <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=606.911s">some</a> virtual cross school tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=610.132s">And</a> there were, we talked a lot about the videos that were pretty well received in the community this past spring because of COVID, but really saying, how can we create some video in the December, January timeframe that gives people an understanding of what our schools are all about and provides people access, you know, certainly this year, knowing that access will be somewhat limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=632.799s">We</a> also talked about tour nights being like TBD for this year, just because of COVID, at least for the time being, but that we put it sort of on the post-pandemic wishlist of things that we would want to do so that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=649.397s">sort</a> of a structured forum in a way for people to engage who want that and that we can move past the feedback that we've gotten from the community in the past where people are reaching out to ask for tours and aren't getting responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=664.728s">And</a> some of that could just be not sort of funneling those things to those requests to a consolidated place is ripe for error and for those things sort of getting dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=679.526s">We</a> also talked about that we will open registration starting in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=683.628s">So</a> that's a big shift for us from what we have done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=686.189s">And</a> it will of course be online, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=689.55s">That</a> we would start Bridges to Kindergarten presentations in February and still plan sort of typical kindergarten visiting day in May, as we have always done, COVID dependent, and then continue with our kindergarten screenings in September for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=706.692s">but</a> really to try to change the timeline of the early parts of the registration process so that we are intentionally outbounding information to prospective families and we're giving them some vehicles to learn about us, whether COVID or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=725.477s">And</a> we are encouraging that registration process to get going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=730.339s">So</a> that was our meeting on November the 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=736.729s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=780.681s">And</a> in that meeting, we talked a bit about, we talked specifically about the technology and the structures that we have in place to ensure that we are able to communicate with our families and our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=795.444s">So</a> we talked a fair bit about the various systems that the district uses in order to be able to communicate and some history around <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=809.571s">why</a> we have had many platforms over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=813.374s">And</a> the other thing we spent a fair bit of time talking about was the plans upcoming for really Medford Public Schools to sort of make a selection for a communication vehicle that is user friendly and can be widely deployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=830.049s">And</a> Dr. Cushing told us that that was sort of pre-COVID, it was on the roadmap for last summer, but that, you know, we made a decision and rightfully so to not disrupt our communication flows last summer amidst all the really important communication around COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=847.513s">but</a> that that is something that they are looking to return to the docket in this upcoming summer so that we can make that transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=856.421s">We</a> also had a good number of folks from our PTOs join us, and we talked a bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=864.067s">communication</a> options that might include requirements and needs that the PTOs have, where they sort of have the same challenges that we do as they are trying to reach and build their communities, and they may or may not have <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=879.923s">a</a> good directory of sorts to help support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=882.844s">So</a> we talked a bit about what those requirements might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=887.126s">We</a> talked a bit about how to make sure that however we pursue a new application that we think about what those requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=896.109s">And</a> we were able to kind of talk through them in an initial draft in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=901.691s">And</a> we talked a bit about certainly a desire on my part, but I think on lots of people's parts that <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=909.622s">However,</a> we allow or enable our PTOs to use our platforms to communicate that it is not something that is reliant on a principle to have the sort of bandwidth or capacity to be in the middle of that communication, which is often the reality of how we have to do things today in many, many cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=931.094s">So</a> we talked a lot about, you know, wanting to make sure that there were some like rules of engagement and things that, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=938.6s">would</a> be workable and that we would work together with that same group of individuals sort of as this unfolds to make sure that they have options as well to communicate with their respective communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=953.084s">So</a> there were a number of people from a number of PTO folks from various school buildings and there was definitely consensus around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=963.407s">We</a> also talked about communication platforms <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=967.13s">in</a> a broader sense to include the ways that teachers interact and converse and communicate with their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=976.638s">And</a> there was feedback in the meeting for us to really think about around the notion that literally every year, your child, especially at the elementary level, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=989.365s">to</a> a new teacher, they may have new platforms or protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=994.949s">And</a> so there's certainly a security step in all of those platforms, but then also a consistency step for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1002.374s">There</a> are districts that have a platform that they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1005.636s">There</a> are others that leave that up to the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1008.839s">And</a> so, I mean, I think the group in general <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1011.255s">definitely</a> wanted to know sort of how the teachers were feeling about that, but there was a desire from the parent community for some consistency in that regard as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1020.417s">So,</a> that's a summary of our meeting on the 1st of December.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5514.06s">There</a> it is, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5516.981s">I</a> did want to say thank you to all the people that are working hard to make all of this testing available. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5522.463s">I</a> know that sort of the numbers make it feel ugly because the testing is revealing to us, you know, where these cases are at and but I think it's so important and it is important that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5535.672s">identifying</a> folks as early as we possibly can so that we can contain the spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5541.955s">So</a> I'm hopeful that we can find a way to continue this testing come January. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5547.838s">So</a> I know for right now, it's only December, but perhaps at the next meeting, we can talk about the real need for this to be able to continue and figure out how we find a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5560.124s">Because</a> I think that's critically important <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5563.266s">think</a> the vaccine news is good, but it's not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5565.607s">So,</a> um, we're going to need this just as much in January as we do right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5569.748s">Um,</a> the other thing I wanted to mention is that I popped out to the dashboard, um, and it has not been updated, especially, and in particular, um, section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5580.491s">And</a> the other thing that I was thinking about as I was listening to the teachers, um, earlier and to this conversation is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5589.516s">there</a> are clear, like there are differences between people who have tested positive and people who have been asked to quarantine because they are close contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5598.699s">And</a> the chart that Tony showed earlier tells us who tested positive, but it does not paint a picture at all of who is a close contact and who is having to quarantine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5609.583s">So</a> I was going to ask that that close contact number quarantine be put on this chart <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5617.426s">spreadsheet,</a> but perhaps maybe it belongs on the dashboard instead in the like school specific conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5626.056s">And</a> maybe that is the appropriate place for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5629.099s">I</a> don't actually care where it goes, but I do think it's critically important that it goes somewhere and that it's maintained on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5635.986s">Along</a> with this spreadsheet so just last night somebody was asking where they could find the spreadsheet and was it updated and I do think the the spreadsheet should be posted on a weekly basis at minimum on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5649.706s">so</a> that people can find it and that section three of the dashboard, which we approved last week, be maintained as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5657.254s">So</a> I think if we can get to that level of specificity with some of the data that we are sharing, I think it will help the community lend clarity because I will admit that as I listened to all of <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5672.19s">this</a> information I was like one person said 15 and one person said 10 and then the same person said seven and so which number is it and maybe all of those numbers are true in some regard, but it's very very difficult to sort of rationalize all of that as it's being spoken so. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5691.238s">Um,</a> I think for those who aren't tuning into this meeting on a regular basis and for people who just on a regular basis really want to know where the school community is at so they can make decisions for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5703.126s">Um,</a> I, I think that this information needs to be publicly available and I can put that in a motion if you would like, but, um, and my colleagues can vote on it, but I would like to see us move forward with that data on a weekly basis.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5753.095s">Yeah,</a> I am more interested in, I guess, and I'm open to feedback on this, but I am more interested in those folks who would normally come to our school buildings who are not coming to the school buildings because they have been identified as a close contact for some reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5769.26s">How</a> many of those are there? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5773.101s">So</a> if there are 10 staff <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5775.965s">who</a> have been identified in some capacity as a close contact and are being asked to quarantine, I wanna see the number 10.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5791.69s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5793.312s">And</a> again, I think, you know, I've had several people reach out to me who their children are going to school and they like going to school and they are happy about going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5805.722s">But</a> as parents, we often make decisions that our kids may or may not love, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5810.847s">And</a> we do that with whatever information the best that we have and we do, you know, we do what we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5816.571s">And</a> so this, you know, there's, there were several parents last night in particular who were saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5821.055s">where's</a> the data so I can go look at it so I can determine whether I feel like this still makes sense for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5828.439s">And</a> I couldn't point them anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=5830.12s">So</a> I would like to be able to say that this stuff is available somewhere on a regular basis.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6072.342s">So</a> I think I'm just trying to understand what that tactically means. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6076.703s">So</a> does that mean we can commit to publishing once a week, which we've, by the way, already done? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6084.277s">Does</a> that, I mean, I think ideally we would be able to publish more than one time a week, maybe twice since we have two cohorts that are coming and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6093.619s">If</a> that's not reasonable, I both understand and am completely frustrated that we are so thin as a district that we can't provide this kind of information to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6109.042s">So</a> I don't think any of us <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6112.043s">wants</a> to or is or can assume that every family has the same risk situation that leads them to say I have complete trust I'm just going to let somebody else take the wheel and they'll call me if I need to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6127.41s">Not</a> every family <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6129.789s">is</a> in that position and not every family wants to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6132.471s">And</a> I think that as challenging as this is, certainly those getting calls need to do what we're asking them to do, but there's a whole slew of people who hear this swirl and don't know what to make of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6147.024s">And</a> I would rather see us commit to publishing data <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6152.837s">couple</a> times a week, then getting to the point, which I think is coming, where the administration gets bogged down with questions from individual parents, how many, how many, how much, how many, that is going to actually take more time than if we just said, we're going to publish this data twice a week, here's where you can find it, go out and look and it'll be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6173.043s">because</a> I think that's taxing on our system as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6177.346s">So</a> I'm trying to avoid that, but I just want people to be able to clearly say to people, like, when can they reasonably expect to see this stuff?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6386.587s">Yeah,</a> and if I could make a suggestion, if we are going to stick with <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6392.321s">publishing</a> once a week, I might suggest that that publication happened on Monday because you're publishing those numbers to this group every other Monday anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6403.205s">The</a> original reason those numbers published on Thursday is because the state gave us data on Wednesday and <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6410.427s">at</a> the time we cared about what that data said as a marker for what we would do next and none of that applies anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6417.812s">So</a> the fact that the dashboard is published on Thursday is arbitrary and I would suggest that if you're going to publish once a week you do it on Monday because <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6427.138s">there's</a> multiple uses and you have, you know, the full testing that comes in from Thursday, Friday, that's totally up to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6434.94s">I</a> think publishing twice a week makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6438.921s">And</a> if we have to wait to get to twice a week until Northeastern is on board, whatever that's all about, I think that's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6446.783s">But</a> I think in the meantime, we do need to commit to what we have already committed to, which is publishing on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=6452.745s">And</a> I would like to see this other information added to that publication.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12060.766s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12061.646s">I</a> would be fine with approving this document in the interim with an expectation that the rules policy and equity subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12071.318s">and</a> look at this in more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12072.798s">And</a> specifically there are references to out-of-school suspension in here, which I think need a look in the larger context based on the work we are doing over the course of between now and the end of the school year to prepare and put systems in place to end out-of-school suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12093.085s">I</a> tried to get to some of the links that were in here and some of them are broken in that reference section. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12099.989s">So</a> I don't know if it's just my copy, but I was unable to particularly to get to that mark link at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12111.253s">And</a> the other thing that I've been sort of thinking about as it relates to this certainly is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12121.954s">And</a> then there was also. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12122.594s">Some</a> of the summary reporting that was referenced earlier as well as. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12128.117s">Having</a> some systemic way to. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12131.119s">To</a> report things other than just forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12135.061s">And</a> then there was also sort of a question for me that we can talk more about in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12148.252s">It's</a> a, it's a long review cycle for something that feels like it changes somewhat rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12154.375s">Certainly,</a> if we purchased curriculum back in 2010 I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12159.885s">It</a> may bear another look to say, is this really the right thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12164.808s">And</a> do we have the right structures in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12166.849s">And</a> then there was also reference in the document to a memorandum of agreement with the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12172.693s">And</a> I would like a copy of that as we think about reviewing all of this with the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12913.699s">Yeah,</a> so I just, before time continues to slip away, I think it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, which was delayed last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12925.587s">for</a> the 19-20 academic year because she does not have an evaluation on file from us, and nor have we established any goals this year so that we can do this process again at the end of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12940.182s">And,</a> you know, she is our only direct report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12947.454s">as</a> a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12948.074s">And</a> so if we are not providing her written evaluation, we're not upholding our end of her employment agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12954.957s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we respect that process and give her the feedback that she deserves from us and that we have a good discussion about goals for the upcoming school year.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13182.497s">And</a> who on the committee is responsible for taking this process through to completion? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13187.6s">Like</a> who is going to ensure that all the steps are followed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13192.363s">Like,</a> does that fall to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13194.925s">Does</a> it fall to a subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13196.946s">Like</a> what is the protocol that you all have used in past years?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13288.573s">Yeah,</a> and I appreciate that it's a big process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13290.874s">So</a> I think that we have to commit to doing the big process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13295.256s">And</a> so my goal was to make sure that we are paying an appropriate amount of attention to our responsibilities as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13305.18s">And</a> certainly if we need more time to complete the process, that is, I think, reasonable and fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13312.843s">I</a> just wanna make sure that we prioritize it so we don't get to June and now we have <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13317.985s">two</a> reviews to write. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13320.926s">More</a> importantly, sort of remembering back that far and trying to write a review this far in arrears is really unfair if you are committed to good review practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13332.771s">Like</a> it's very unfair to wait months and months and months and then say this is what I think I thought back then because you just can't <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13341.256s">You</a> can't objectively sort of put all of that out of your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13344.079s">So</a> I want to make sure that we sort of get caught up and we're behind for lots of valid reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13351.648s">But</a> I also want to make sure that we have the discussion about goal setting because that goal setting discussion is what enables the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13359.998s">for</a> next year, which I feel like we will just finish the superintendent's evaluation for last year when we are going to have to start the process all over again for this current year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13371.648s">And</a> we won't even have talked about goals, which is also it's really also unfair to be setting goals mid-year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13381.153s">because</a> being able to achieve goals when you haven't set them until the midpoint of the year makes it really unfair for the person we're asking to do all of this great work to actually be able to achieve goals.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13505.331s">And</a> what about the goals for this school year?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13537.55s">Okay,</a> my recollection of the type of goal setting we're supposed to be doing in the superintendent's evaluation is far more prescriptive than the like day-to-day stuff we talk about all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13550.102s">So</a> they're supposed to be quantifiable and data-driven and I think they generally are intended to be slightly different than what you're referring to.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13810.258s">And</a> at what date are we committing as a committee to do our part in the evaluation process?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14001.561s">So</a> I think we sort of talk a lot about the denominator when it comes to students testing positive or staff testing positive and <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14013.103s">we</a> have an incredible sort of privilege of lots of tools available at our disposal to keep our community safe and I would like to have a better understanding of how adopted the tools are that we have so that we just are clear about if we're saying, you know, if we're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14035.727s">eight</a> people tested positive, is it eight out of 10 or is it eight out of 4,000 or is it some other number? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14042.83s">So</a> I would just like to have a better understanding of those participation rates as we head into the spring where I think there is, it sounds like still some question even about whether we can continue those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14056.516s">So</a> it would be helpful to understand what those numbers are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14198.223s">I</a> think the point of laying out a schedule for the budget is not about trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14203.724s">And</a> I'm so tired of us talking about who doesn't trust the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14209.326s">It</a> has nothing to do with trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14211.646s">It</a> has to do with the fact that there are six people on this committee, countless administrators who need to be prepared for this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14218.968s">And</a> a public that really wants to understand what the budget is going to look like for this upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14224.412s">I</a> mean, every day there's another article that talks about how dire the school budgets are going to be next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14230.075s">And</a> I think it's our responsibility as the people who approve the budget to have a robust and thoughtful conversation <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14239.301s">Um,</a> and all I'm asking is for a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14241.503s">I</a> didn't prescribe what the schedule is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14243.465s">I</a> just want to know so I can mark it in my calendar and plan my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14247.328s">I</a> don't think that has anything to do with trust, and I think I have a second already on this motion, so we can go ahead and vote for it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14395.684s">January</a> 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14396.885s">Is</a> that what you're suggesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14398.226s">That's</a> when our school committee meeting is, the second one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14400.829s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14401.209s">January</a> 25th it is.<h2><a href="../2020-12-02_AfWQKXpwhx4/2020-12-02_AfWQKXpwhx4.html">Communications/Stakeholder Engagement  Strategy Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=0.151s">participation</a> by members of the public and our parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=11.976s">For</a> this meeting members of the public who wish to listen in or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=18.318s">No</a> in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=28.326s">In</a> the event that we are unable to do so despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford or Medford Community Media websites an audio or video recording, transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=41.994s">The</a> meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 from 5 to 6.30 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=50.678s">Since</a> the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log on or call in by using the following link or call in number <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=58.343s">The</a> Zoom meeting number is 944-5823-5080. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=60.465s">You</a> can also dial in on the phone by dialing 301-715-8592 and using meeting code 944-5823-5080. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=67.609s">So</a> the objectives for today's meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=84.713s">are</a> to discuss stakeholder requirements for improved and seamless communications, outline and review current technical supports and systems used by MPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=92.42s">This</a> communication strategy work is being developed based on the below approved school committee resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=97.504s">Be</a> it resolved that the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee begin a district-wide effort to develop a communication strategy roadmap that examines our current communications processes and technology system views. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=109.907s">Be</a> it also resolved that the strategy work explores our efforts to reach all audiences, including families and staff within the district, and recommend improvements to increase our success. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=120.253s">Be</a> it also resolved that the strategy effort review the MPS website and recommended changes to improve the quality of the content therein. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=128.438s">And</a> so today, what we talked about doing today was specifically to focus on <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=136.708s">some</a> of the technology platforms, and more importantly, the requirements or the opportunities that we see as a collective whole to start to inform having some systemic ways and processes to make sure this communication is able to be pushed out in various methods in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=162.668s">According</a> to the agenda, I think one of the first things we wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about was our district's goals around the communication strategy efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=176.273s">And</a> then we'll talk about opportunities and any requirements that various stakeholder groups may have or want to share about communication in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=188.396s">And</a> then talk a little bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=190.961s">what</a> we have in place today that is used so that we can figure out what the next steps are to not only understanding where we're at and what we feel like we need, but then, you know, creating a pathway to being able to identify what is missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=209.972s">And</a> in some cases, I imagine prioritize related spending if that becomes necessary, if there are tools needed that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=220.655s">So</a> I think the first thing on the agenda, really just to talk about our overall goals around communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=228.499s">And</a> I do see some members of the public have joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=232.201s">So</a> I wanna encourage you guys all to participate as well, but I'll open the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=240.045s">What's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=240.466s">Do</a> you wanna take attendance? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=243.667s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=246.689s">Member</a> McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=248.55s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=249.65s">And</a> member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=252.012s">And</a> member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=252.972s">So</a> three present and zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=259.057s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=262.2s">So</a> I think the first, you know, the first agenda item from my standpoint is more discussion oriented around our goals for communication across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=272.648s">And</a> certainly it's hard to talk about goals without talking about opportunities sort of mixed in with those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=280.075s">I'm</a> happy for that conversation to flow however it flows. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=283.897s">But</a> I didn't know if there was anyone who wanted to start or offer a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=290.42s">And</a> then, Susie, I'm making an assumption that you're taking notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=294.622s">But</a> if that's not the case, just let me know so I can try to grab them as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=298.624s">I</a> am taking notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=300.385s">OK,</a> perfect.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=306.028s">OK,</a> so it's five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=312.508s">All</a> right, so district. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=317.992s">So</a> I guess the first agenda item is around goals for our communication strategy effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=324.457s">And</a> I have heard a number of things voiced certainly in the community over time that talk about the communication strategy in a bigger sense, but as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=340.156s">what</a> our expectations are of the district as a community and what the district's expectations are of being able to communicate with parents and members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=354.565s">So</a> I think that's a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=358.408s">And</a> I don't know if anyone has anything they want to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=362.11s">Melanie?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=373.796s">I</a> wasn't asking that because I think I was making an assumption that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=380.26s">Stated</a> goals around. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=383.742s">Communication,</a> but maybe that is a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=389.166s">If</a> we do have stated goals around communication, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=393.103s">that</a> would be a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=394.263s">And</a> if not, perhaps that's the conversation we should be having.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=435.203s">Sure,</a> I think Melanie was asking a question that made me sort of realize I've jumped to a conclusion, which is that we don't have a stated set of goals around communications <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=451.683s">across</a> the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=454.485s">And</a> I think to be fair, maybe we do, and people just don't know what they are, but it's, I think it's okay if we don't just yet either.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=762.176s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=764.617s">And</a> I think some of the things that started in that task force, which I was a part of, you know, there was definitely an acknowledgement that <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=776.563s">It</a> was too lofty a goal for everyone to be happy with anything we might say over the next year, because that's just like sort of not the current reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=789.37s">But</a> we talked a lot about the fact that if people were unhappy, it wasn't at the hands of us not communicating <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=803.27s">what</a> is happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=804.471s">So</a> I may not like what you're saying to me, but it's not that you're saying nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=808.393s">So</a> we sort of, I think that task really tried to say like, what is our reality? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=814.897s">And</a> like, what are we trying to accomplish here? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=816.538s">And</a> we wanna make sure, you know, basic fundamental things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=820.72s">And</a> I think as that program started to roll out, and I think even now, what it did sort of reveal, at least for me is that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=833.173s">definitely</a> didn't have good systems in place to enable the kind of communicating that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=841.239s">So,</a> I probably helped like 25 people over the course of the summer who were like, I don't get any emails and I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=851.167s">And</a> people have tried to fix it and they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=854.75s">And</a> so I think there are systemic issues that sort of get in the way of us being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=861.07s">to</a> simply reach everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=862.451s">So</a> I think that's like one consideration when we're talking about having a broader strategic plan is what are those platforms that we're going to use? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=870.858s">Who's</a> going to use them? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=872.84s">What</a> are they going to be used for? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=874.421s">And</a> how do we sort of drive some of that consistency? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=877.824s">And</a> then there are a number of folks who have joined us from various PTOs because I think when I think about the various communities, we have certainly our PTOs <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=889.623s">have</a> a unique perspective on their own school community and how communication flows within their community and the feedback that they get, but they also have like these same challenges of how do they communicate with their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=903.093s">And</a> you can be, you know, I think it's quite easy to be on one group's mailing list and not on the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=910.078s">So</a> I get all the emails that my PTO sends, but I get none of the emails that the administration sends, for example, or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=917.384s">And</a> part of that is because <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=919.235s">I</a> don't think we have a single way that we push out those communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=924.799s">They</a> historically have happened in lots of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=927.861s">And</a> I'm just curious, you know, when we talk about opportunity, for me, some of the deficiencies are around like we're spending energy helping individuals troubleshoot their email access. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=941.051s">We</a> are not spending that energy actually communicating, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=945.254s">We're</a> just troubleshooting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=946.215s">So</a> what are the ways that we could <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=951.036s">investigate</a> or explore the technology that we have available to us to change how we're doing things so that that piece of the process gets a little bit more streamlined and simple so that parents could, you know, in my mind, I would like parents to be able to go to one place and know that if their information is correct in this one place that anybody district wide who's trying to communicate with them can effectively reach them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=980.75s">And</a> I'm not sure that exists just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=984.613s">And</a> then when I think about communicating, it's one thing to sort of push out a message, it's another to know that it's being received, and it's another entirely to know that it's being opened, and maybe then you extrapolate that it's been read. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=999.625s">And</a> I don't know enough about our system currently to know whether that is something that is even possible in our current <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1010.448s">technical</a> portfolio.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1108.212s">Dave?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1282.824s">And</a> when you are looking at those like statistics, open rates, those kinds of things, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1290.525s">and</a> you're pushing emails, are they going from school brains or are they going from school messenger? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1297.968s">Like</a> I think over the summer, I heard that the two sort of talk to each other, but don't quite. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1304.551s">So</a> I was just like, I don't feel like I properly understand the connection between the systems.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1495.286s">And</a> we use, are we using, what is Blackboard do?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1545.066s">Okay,</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1549.775s">School</a> brains is the piece of technology that elementary school families do not have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1554.379s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1593.227s">And</a> do parents know that they could or should be doing that in school brains in the elementary schools?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1630.894s">it</a> sounds like one of our goals, whether via the pandemic or just in a larger sense is that school brains becomes the place where all district communications come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1645.04s">I</a> don't think that is what happens in practice always. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1651.042s">And</a> certainly when you kind of dive down into the weeds of like how other, how principals, teachers, et cetera, communicate with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1661.37s">I</a> know that there are other tools out there that PTOs are using. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1664.531s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand, like, are we, is there a concerted effort for us all to be sort of funneling to Schoolbrains? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1674.255s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1682.139s">But</a> it's the place where you would put your email.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1884.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1886.249s">Um,</a> but it sounds like, you know, one of our goals is that all families will have access to school brains so that they can maintain their own contact information so that the district can reach them, you know, via whether it's school messenger or blackboard or robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1906.619s">But</a> if the data is not in school brains appropriately or correctly, that <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1913.19s">Family</a> is not going to be communicated with as we push out updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1917.613s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1919.474s">So</a> I know there are a number of people on the phone who joined us from PTO's and I didn't know if you all had anything you wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1929.22s">Contribute</a> to the discussion as it relates to like you all as a stakeholder group. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1935.864s">In</a> terms of communications you receive from the. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1940.865s">the</a> district or things you hear about or communication needs that you have that sort of fit into this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1946.828s">So</a> I just wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=1949.729s">Sort</a> of ask if you all if any of you I see a bunch of faces had anything you wanted to say Kristen.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2001.435s">Which</a> PTO, Kristen?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2009.717s">I</a> know that at Brooks, they have a system that they use that does sort of the same things that we're talking about, which is called A2Z Connect. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2021.705s">And</a> I believe McGlynn Elementary may be using A to Z as well, but I could be wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2031.829s">Amanda?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2034.189s">Hi.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2127.18s">Is</a> that, I mean, I think that is something that recurs and certainly at the elementary level, I think the other driver of wanting some sort of platform among parents at the elementary school level is to establish your network of friends as your kids sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2151.023s">go</a> progress through the grades and they go from having you know three friends in one class they go to another class and they realize like oh there's more than like three friends that I can have and. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2160.593s">Their</a> network start to grow and families are trying to be in contact with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2165.718s">Certainly,</a> that is something that I think the brooks Community I think that's why the mcglenn started using it as well, has. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2173.227s">appreciated</a> about using A to Z, although it is amazingly labor-intensive for a volunteer organization to maintain that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2183.772s">And</a> then I think what inevitably happens, particularly in the elementary level, is it comes up on a kid's birthday or some reason why you want to reach out to the whole class. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2198.2s">And</a> it has, at times, I think, been really difficult for parents <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2202.607s">figure</a> out how to access the right group of families to make sure that if you are intending to include an entire classroom full of children, that you're not relying on your seven-year-old to remember the first and last name of 18 children in your class. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2218.815s">So</a> I think at the elementary level, they have this sort of other requirement of how they connect to each other that does change over time and become <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2230.413s">I</a> guess sort of less important because families make those connections and have ways to sort of get to people that they know when they get to middle school, high school that you don't have when you start out in Medford Public Schools when your children are very young. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2245.745s">So</a> I think there, to me, it sounds like there's sort of a need or a requirement for the PTOs to have some level of <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2256.683s">way</a> to communicate with this same group of people that Medford Public Schools is communicating with. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2261.587s">And</a> then I think there are, there's like this other question of families having a need or a want to communicate with others and are there tools out there or does our current tool set allow for those kinds of things to happen that we just haven't enabled or are they not possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2281.822s">Are</a> there tools out there that do make those things possible that sort of integrate <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2286.839s">in</a> that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2287.739s">And</a> I don't know if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2414.68s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2418.881s">I'll</a> be out in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2428.462s">Sorry</a> guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2433.944s">Okay,</a> so I think those, I think those sort of get to like special requirements and stakeholder groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2442.106s">Are</a> there other things around comments from our various stakeholder groups that we should talk about before we move on to where our technology might be able to intersect with some of these requirements? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2459.586s">Lisa?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2462.848s">Oh,</a> we can't hear you, Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2464.349s">Can</a> you not unmute?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2547.305s">And</a> I think the answer is, it depends who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2550.707s">Like,</a> and I think that's, you know, I think when you talk about reaching people, talking about preferences makes a huge difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2559.673s">So,</a> you know, in a full, like if you were looking at sort of a full scale communications operation, you would know that Melanie prefers a text and Kristen prefers an email and Jenny prefers a robocall or, or <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2575.738s">know,</a> and Kathy wants all three. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2577.239s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2578.94s">Like</a> you would have the ability to say this is how this person wants to be communicated with and then channel those communications to the place where it's going to reach them the fastest.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2907.035s">Yeah,</a> and I think the question about the PTOs is that there can be a tremendous amount of activity that falls into the bucket of like not the most important thing a principal needs to do in a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2922.245s">That</a> is really important to the school community, but it's like the last thing the principal should be spending time pushing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2930.85s">Like,</a> you know, hey, this fundraiser is about to close and this is your last chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2935.673s">You</a> know, those are the kinds of things that, you know, I think PTOs would feel bad asking school administrators to participate in in that way, if there was another way for us to preserve the sort of security aspect, but also enable them to be their own agents in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2960.735s">And</a> so perhaps as we look at <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2963.14s">messenger</a> and blackboard there's an opportunity to say are there ways to grant like junior level access to certain folks who can push out emails on behalf of PTOs and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2976.23s">That</a> may be a good way to to try to get at some of this without allowing people access to to data and I think you know one ways one of the ways A to Z does that is you sort of have the option to say <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2991.992s">what</a> kind of communications that you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=2994.433s">And</a> if you don't want any communications from the PTO, for example, like you just say, I don't, I'm willing to put like my name in there as though my child is in this classroom, but I don't want any communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3006.176s">And</a> then there's no access to that data based on what the parent has opted in for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3013.217s">It's</a> like, you have to say it's okay, or it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3016.758s">So</a> that might be something that Blackboard <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3020.579s">or</a> even school messenger could do for us if we are able to get to looking at that kind of upgrade this coming summer.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3298.218s">Yeah,</a> I like that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3300.14s">Claire?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3560.187s">Yeah,</a> and I think having a system that allows some flexibility so that as those types of communications change over time, they are easy enough to change in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3572.636s">They're</a> easy for people to change their mind about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3577.719s">I'm</a> always sensitive to systems that require somebody to reach the assistant superintendent in order to make a change to their preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3586.946s">Those</a> kinds of things concern me because I think that's where <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3591.366s">become</a> non systemic and they start to fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3593.887s">So</a> when we talk about what we want the applications to be able to do for us, those would be things. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3601.469s">Those</a> would be things that I would want to see us be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3605.911s">I</a> see Kristen has her hand in the air.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3763.478s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3767.579s">The</a> other thing that we had on our agenda as a stakeholder group were some of our subgroups of students, particularly our English language learners, but also our families where the parents may not speak English, but the children speak English, or they used to be in our EL program and they've since sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3792.396s">assimilated</a> into the Gen Ed space, but there may not be complete fluency at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3798.541s">So</a> I think the other thing or the other concern that I have is about those folks, you know, not showing up to the Zoom call to tell us what they need from communication and whether we're like meeting their requirements or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3817.116s">And</a> I think that's sort of a conversation we have a lot and often <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3822.809s">in</a> various ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3824.151s">I</a> know we talked a lot about it during the task force on communication over the summer, but I did hear, I heard from a teacher recently who was saying like, there's all this communications going out, but there is a population of families who still don't completely know what they've chosen or if they still have a choice <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3849.048s">or</a> if they can make a change or what, you know, sort of what this, what this means, you know, as, as, you know, the pandemic continues to unfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3860.075s">So</a> I think for some of our subgroups, I think I worry the most about are they like receiving and able and are being able to engage with the communications that we're sending, even though we are translating, which I think is, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3876.498s">a</a> huge step forward in something that only happened sort of sporadically in the past, but now it's happening with some consistency, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3885.161s">I</a> don't feel like, I think we have great strategies to know whether we're reaching people in a way that's meaningful so that they are able to engage with the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3899.506s">And</a> I don't know if there's necessarily a technology component or a fix to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=3906.127s">or</a> not, but I wanted to throw that out there because even though I don't believe there's a tremendous number of people on the phone that can sort of represent that subgroup, I think they are important to make sure we're thinking about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4379.37s">Yeah,</a> I would like to make sure that when we're looking at what Blackboard or any system can do for us, that it can also help us identify <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4389.736s">I</a> need translation services and what is that preference? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4396.482s">Because</a> I think, like you said, something like that on an individualized level is very labor intensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4403.528s">And</a> we just frankly, we don't have a communications department that has the bandwidth to do this sort of in that like manual way, but that is where technology can help us start to collect this information <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4418.914s">start</a> to understand what those requests are so that we can start to meet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4423.76s">The</a> other question I had, when you're doing video, Dr. Edward-Vinson, are there translations happening on the video?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4471.832s">So</a> there is an organization called Rev.com and once you have a video you can send it to them and they can subtitle it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4484.702s">And</a> so you send it off to them <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4486.948s">They</a> do the subtitling, and it's very inexpensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4491.612s">It's</a> like a 24-hour turnaround or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4495.516s">And</a> when I've done it, I think the English subtitles are free, which helps for those who are hearing impaired, or maybe I don't want to listen to a video out loud for some reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4510.029s">I'm</a> on a train or whatever, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4512.575s">back</a> in regular times when people wrote to train places, but it also allows you to say, I want this translated in Spanish and Arabic, you know, whatever it is, and you send it off, they send back files with those closed captions right in the file so that if you're going to post it, I know if you're going to post it to Facebook, you can post it in a way that it's a video, like one video, and all of those things are implicit in the one video. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4541.282s">you</a> just have to post it the right way, but then you could also post them as separate files. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4546.666s">I</a> just know every time I've done it, I've been surprised at how affordable it is to translate a video. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4554.932s">I</a> mean, typically a relatively short video, but I don't think it would be like a backbreaking budget expense to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4564.479s">And</a> that may get some different traction than you're able to get today. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4570.049s">That</a> may be something worth looking into as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4689.67s">you</a> know, we can post to social media easily in that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4694.075s">And</a> it takes a little bit of a lag or something to post it to the TV channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4698.659s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4699.16s">So</a> I can send you the information along with what I have done in the past, just as like a frame of reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4707.608s">And</a> then if there's a way for us to integrate that, I think that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4714.378s">We</a> are a few minutes from the end of the meeting and one of the things that I think we've talked a little bit about are some of our subgroups and spending some time thinking about those subgroups in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4728.473s">And</a> I think Melanie said that could be a meeting unto itself and I tend to agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4735.453s">We</a> do not have an agenda topic yet for our April meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4739.535s">So</a> my thought is that we slot that into our April meeting, which gives us ample time to make sure that we can reach out into the community, figure out how to engage the right folks in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4753.002s">But</a> I can put that on the agenda for the April meeting, which is the next meeting where we don't yet have a topic because we will run out of time today. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4760.886s">And</a> I don't think we have like <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4762.682s">perfect</a> audience for that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4764.524s">So</a> does that work, Melanie?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4871.069s">So</a> I think just to recap, we sort of talked about a lot of different, I'll say like goals, requirements, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4880.83s">And</a> it seems like the time is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4882.771s">And</a> perhaps in these minutes, we can sort of crystallize what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4889.441s">so</a> that when we think about a full implementation of Blackboard or any other, whether it's Blackboard or it's not, we know what those requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4900.845s">And</a> so when we're implementing, we can be thoughtful about making sure those requirements can be implemented as we implement versus sort of, you know, what always happens is you implement and then you say, oh, well, we forgot this thing and now it's too hard to go back and fix because we weren't thinking about that architecture at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4918.833s">The</a> other thing that we didn't talk about that was on my mind is whether, and it sounds like it might, like a Blackboard-style technology would also integrate and allow us to have a more consistent present, like district-owned presence when we're pushing out to social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4939.968s">I</a> think a lot of that happens sort of catch-as-catch-can now for lots of reasons, but if Blackboard can start to be the integrator <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4948.625s">of</a> those kinds of posts, I think that also allows people to start to dial in their social media interests if those posts are all coming from the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=4960.952s">But</a> I do feel like at times I see posts from all over the place as it relates to my kids going to school that we could consolidate with a tool that can do that for us.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5025.825s">And</a> does Blackboard provide or maybe a requirement that sort of coming out is <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5033.508s">a</a> place to natively store those posts that ultimately push out so that somebody can go in and say, these are the posts I'm going to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5045.294s">And</a> they're going to go to these various social media platforms on this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5048.516s">And</a> you sort of set it and forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5051.258s">You</a> also have that archival space, that archival place, because it's all in a central application. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5057.341s">And</a> you're not natively copying and pasting on Facebook and on Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5061.96s">your</a> Facebook account gets deleted, you still have the platform, it's a CRM platform typically, that sort of comes to mind for me, where you would then have all of that like right in the platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5075.649s">I</a> don't know if Blackboard has that capability or if some sort of additional platform is needed to handle that social media integration piece.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5117.559s">So</a> there may be a good reason to, as we sort of consolidate our social media presence, have a tool that allows us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5129.29s">I</a> mean, I use one for my organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5131.873s">It's</a> very inexpensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5134.675s">I</a> don't even know what we pay for it, but it's probably less than $100 a year or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5139.239s">It's</a> very inexpensive, but it allows us to <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5142.427s">to</a> proactively say this is what we're going to do on this day, take the time, set it all up, and then it's there forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5148.372s">So</a> it might be something if Blackboard can't do that, there might be another tool out there that would enable something like that to happen and provide that archival. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5163.983s">Does</a> anybody have any other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5167.006s">I</a> think we have like one minute left. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5169.502s">And</a> I was hoping we would finish early because somebody was taking claim of finishing a meeting early last week, but I'll settle for just on time.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5191.074s">Is</a> there anything else before we adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5196.478s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5201.27s">All</a> right, a motion to adjourn by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5207.634s">So</a> roll call, member McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5210.876s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5211.977s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5213.077s">Member</a> Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5213.738s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5214.838s">Meeting</a> is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5215.559s">Great</a> meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5216.359s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5216.98s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AfWQKXpwhx4&t=5217.28s">Bye.</a> <h2><a href="../2020-11-25_akf9szSeoOw/2020-11-25_akf9szSeoOw.html">Special School Committee Meeting to Discuss COVID 19 Metrics</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2497.405s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2498.686s">I'm</a> looking at the chart and I just want to make, I think this chart deserves some definitions around remote and hybrid because I think as people look at this, you know, to look at September, it sounds great until you realize that a very small number of children went to school for three days in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2519.6s">So</a> it's good that there was no transmission, but like the even chance of that was very, very low because our <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2526.946s">our</a> cohort A didn't come back until September 28th, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2531.007s">And</a> so I think what is complex about what we are doing here is we have students who have chosen hybrid who are still at home, and then we have remote students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2543.63s">And</a> so when we say it's remote students, I want people to just be clear about who is in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2550.732s">So</a> for example, like the question that I had based on some of the conversation we've been having is in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2556.363s">Medford</a> High School, which in October only Cohort A was in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2561.728s">There</a> were three students who tested positive who are hybrid and six who tested positive who are remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2569.114s">Does</a> that mean that those three students were from Cohort A and the six <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2576.009s">were</a> everybody else, or does it mean that the three include students who chose hybrid, but are still home because the high school has not welcomed students back. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2589.241s">And</a> the six is among those students who have chosen to stay remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2594.486s">So</a> I think that October line for the high school feels like the place where we can clearly sort of define this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2603.02s">because</a> it's uncomplicated in that we were not rolling students in in the month of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2611.684s">So</a> I don't think that it's crystal clear, certainly not on this chart, what these categories mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2620.228s">And</a> I think it can and should be clear as we publish this data.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2668.486s">I'm</a> asking, yeah, I'm asking which way we are interpreting these headers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2675.33s">And</a> I think the reason it's relevant is because if you're going to start moving students across the line, so to speak, the data gets really hard to digest and interpret, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2688.197s">So</a> if somebody, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2691.082s">is</a> on the right side of the line today, but when we welcome them back now they're on the left side of the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2696.604s">I</a> don't know that that is as helpful as if we had clarity about, you know, the students who are in and maybe it is as simple as having three columns like you're suggesting, but I just, I want the definitions, whether it's two columns or three columns to be really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2715.079s">and</a> unchanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2715.98s">So</a> when we talk about our population, we can be clear about what the population is and means as we look at the number of four to conclude is four good or four not good based on that population.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3375.804s">I</a> actually have several questions about the dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3378.686s">So</a> to Member McLaughlin's point, what <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3385.583s">is</a> the recommendation about how the colors relate to school closing.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3536.987s">I</a> want to talk about section three in just a second, but my question is about section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3542.592s">So</a> community health metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3545.455s">In</a> the original plan, red meant remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3550.66s">And</a> I think what member McLaughlin was asking is, does red equal remote?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3576.693s">Correct,</a> it means somebody would need to make a decision, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3668.83s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3670.187s">So</a> that's what I thought this was actually saying, but it doesn't say that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3676.349s">And</a> I think it's important for the community to understand explicitly that our color status from the state does not mean we must do anything in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3688.893s">So</a> to put it on the chart, I think it's important, but I think it needs to include language that talks about the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3700.214s">These</a> metrics are, there's nothing about this color coding that drives a decision automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3709.499s">I</a> think that needs to be clear on the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3714.021s">I</a> also think it needs to be clear on the document what happens when we do sort of get to the point of having to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3723.825s">So</a> when we end up in red, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3729.868s">Like,</a> does that mean that the superintendent is going to bring a recommendation in collaboration with the Board of Health to this committee where we will have a discussion and take a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3745.161s">Or</a> is this proposal saying you alone will make this decision?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3852.437s">So,</a> and I appreciate that sort of if the governor says <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3857.854s">sort</a> of hands down, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3859.015s">But</a> I think what I'm getting at is there is a difference between you giving us a heads up of a decision that you've made and you asking this committee to collaborate on the best path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3873.181s">I</a> just wanna be clear what you are recommending tonight so that I can determine how I will vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3883.703s">So</a> I wanna understand, are you going in those situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3887.386s">Are</a> you coming to this committee where we will listen to the experts? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3892.791s">I</a> don't believe anybody on this committee is suggesting that we not listen to the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3896.494s">So</a> I take complete exception to continued references that people are not listening to experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3902.179s">I</a> think this committee wants to listen to the experts and has tried to do so pragmatically and carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3908.901s">I</a> do think that this is a decision that has wide impact on our community and the purpose of the school committee presiding over the schools is so that the entire community has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3921.708s">and</a> a way to engage in what is really important to them as it relates to sending their children to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3930.295s">If</a> you are making a decision and you are informing us, there is no collaboration or discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3936.861s">I'm</a> not saying that is or isn't a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3940.524s">I'm</a> just asking to be crystal clear what you are asking us to approve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3954.985s">So-</a> We gave them the authority to proceed with the staggered hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3960.668s">That</a> is different than blanket authority forevermore. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3964.27s">I'm</a> asking so that we are all clear about what and who and how we will make this decision.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3976.864s">Yes,</a> I actually am not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3978.484s">I</a> was hoping for an answer to that question and I have several more.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4000.708s">So</a> when the motion asks us to approve this plan, what is this plan that we're approving in this regard?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4316.748s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4318.769s">I</a> still have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4323.27s">I'm</a> happy and I'm happy to <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4326.348s">take</a> turns, but I still have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4328.609s">So</a> I don't know how you want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4330.09s">Do</a> you want me just to finish my questions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4498.158s">So</a> I feel like we are sort of muddying section two and section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4504.141s">So</a> I'm gonna ask my questions about section three and then I'll circle back to section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4511.205s">In</a> section three, what I wanted to say is that I, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4517.225s">want</a> to commend A, the fact that our transmission has been so low, even as we have brought people back. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4524.369s">I</a> think that is commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4525.77s">And</a> it is a testament to the hard work and the really thoughtful, pragmatic ways that you are making these decisions every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4534.556s">So</a> I don't want anybody on this call to think that I disagree with your decisions to date about programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4545.504s">that</a> have to go remote for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4548.306s">And</a> to my knowledge, your decision-making has been exactly what I would have done myself, which is there is no more trust than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4559.365s">So</a> I wanna say that in section, as it relates to section three, I think we did a lot of hard work collaboratively as an organization and with community members and with community input to really sort of flush out those scenarios and they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4576.574s">And</a> I wanna see them continue to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4579.376s">What</a> I would ask in section three <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4582.402s">is</a> that we circle back to the intent of what is in the language in section three, and that instead of this blurb that is here, that is not super meaningful week to week, that this section three going forward outline whether there are buildings where there are special conditions happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4606.735s">So</a> for example, the McGlynn Middle School <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4611.752s">there</a> is a sixth grade classroom or the Brooks Elementary School, there is a third grade classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4619.257s">Something</a> that gives people who come to look at this dashboard, some indication of what is happening across the district on a regular week for those programs that have had to be sent home remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4632.165s">It's</a> not, the goal of that is so that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4637.813s">Everyone</a> just doesn't sort of run around on pins and needles wondering when the shoe is going to drop when they're going to get a phone call when somebody is going to make a decision, but instead we are doing this, we are following our own rules in this particular instance section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4653.105s">All</a> I'm asking is that we outline them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4655.346s">So</a> if the motion that goes forward, if this needs to be a separate motion, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4662.089s">If</a> it needs to be part of the complete motion, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4665.97s">But</a> I do think it's really important that this section outline what was intended of the section. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4672.693s">And</a> I feel like I can speak about the intent of the section because I helped author it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4677.975s">So</a> I know what we intended to put here <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4682.606s">I</a> want the community to have the benefit of seeing the hard work that we are doing to keep community spread and school spread low by making good decisions as those situations come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4696.07s">So</a> as it relates to section three, the superintendent, according to our rules, has always had the complete authority to make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4705.872s">And</a> I don't think there's any reason to change section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4709.613s">What</a> I am asking about <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4712.302s">is</a> when we are making decisions based on section two, that is outside of just the scope and control of the superintendent or frankly the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4724.472s">That</a> is where we are saying what is happening in our community is noteworthy enough for us to make a decision about schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4734.481s">And</a> in that case, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4737.21s">I</a> do actually think it's reasonable to want to collaborate in some fashion about that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4744.193s">Whether</a> my colleagues agree with me or not remains to be seen, but I would say if we can make an update to the language so that we are clear that red doesn't mean anything nor does any other color in isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4761.162s">And</a> I think we should remove the conclusion <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4764.72s">because</a> I think the conclusion implies that the colors mean something and alone they do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4773.044s">I</a> think that what people are really wanting to know is who and how will this decision get made. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4780.127s">So</a> for example, we just said the governor has said if you're in red for four weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4786.519s">then</a> you should be talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4788.879s">I</a> think that would be worth putting on this dashboard so people understand that that is the point at which they could expect some sort of action to change outside of what is happening in our schools, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4804.122s">And</a> back to like the issue of who makes this decision because this decision is not <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4813.151s">solely</a> about what happens in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4815.153s">It's</a> not solely about making a fast decision based on staffing, transportation, whatever have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4824.1s">All</a> I'm asking is that we have a collaborative discussion about that on a regular basis when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4831.334s">I</a> am not asking you to close schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4833.555s">I</a> am from four people this weekend that we were gonna make a decision tonight to go remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4838.238s">I</a> don't believe that we're making that kind of decision and I don't believe that's ever been discussed as a reason for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4844.441s">But</a> this is what happens when we're not clear about how we plan to use the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4852.045s">All</a> I'm asking is that we be clear about how we use the data and who will be making this decision and that this committee tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4861.048s">vote</a> on how those decisions will be made going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4865.972s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5013.887s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5014.227s">So</a> as the superintendent pointed out in our last meeting, we never voted to change what is listed as section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5022.609s">So</a> section three is district and school specific conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5026.171s">It</a> currently reads <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5027.879s">Our</a> top priority is to monitor the safety of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5030.461s">We</a> will use the Medford Board of Health and MPS managing local COVID conditions in our school buildings framework to guide our decision-making as we work with the Medford Board of Health to recommend plans and next steps as cases are identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5042.35s">We</a> will follow state-issued guidelines in regards to notification testing, quarantine protocols, and COVID-19 positive persons and close contacts before a final decision is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5052.661s">On</a> the district or school closure, the superintendent must advise Jesse and will communicate with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5058.387s">So</a> the point the intent of this section was that there was a box that could say, for example, there's a special condition right school specific condition that exists in a certain building so it's you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5072.874s">School</a> A, and it's a classroom in grade three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5076.457s">So</a> that if somebody comes out here and takes a look at it, they understand, does that apply to me or does it not apply to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5082.081s">Does</a> it apply to my child or does it not apply to my child? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5084.843s">And</a> it also gives the community at any given time, a glance at what are all these decisions that we have made to keep our students safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5094.528s">across</a> the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5095.668s">So</a> what I'm asking is that a box be added, the language is fine, but the box that is added should reflect those classrooms, programs, grades, whatever they are, that are full remote because of a decision that the superintendent has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5114.272s">So</a> all I'm asking is that as those decisions are made and somebody is sent home remote for some amount of time, that it be listed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5191.202s">I</a> think the value is to be able to see it across the district to, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5197.402s">provide</a> information for families so that they understand that we are making good rational decisions about this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5205.208s">And,</a> and frankly, as you said that I would rather us. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5212.34s">publish</a> official information, then allow that information to go out by the rumor mill, which generates the calls that say, hey, I heard you were going to make a decision to send everybody remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5224.607s">All</a> I'm suggesting is that being clear and upfront about this stuff allows Medford Public Schools to <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5234.168s">overwhelmingly</a> be the source of information on what is happening in our schools, rather than allowing that out to social media.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5402.677s">Yeah,</a> and I think if we, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5405.387s">you</a> know, created an asterisk that said that we are not reporting, you know, we are not reporting special conditions due to confidentiality issues at a given building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5417.136s">I</a> think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5418.077s">I</a> think that's really a really reasonable way to provide information that is not going to disclose anybody's confidential information, but still provide the community at large some information <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5434.559s">about</a> what is going on across the system, that would be helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5521.2s">Yeah,</a> I think that's really reasonable.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7874.449s">Just</a> can somebody reread the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7876.45s">And</a> I think there is another community member with a hand up.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8052.428s">Yes,</a> we just voted on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8055.051s">Yeah,</a> the two amendments were already voted on, so we're good there. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8059.174s">I</a> think it's just Kathy's motion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8114.948s">Okay,</a> member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8116.569s">Which</a> motion are we voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8118.329s">Are</a> we voting on Kathy's motion?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8122.351s">The</a> amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8123.291s">And</a> okay, can somebody reread the amendment?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8141.619s">Based</a> on section <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8144.033s">two</a> community health metrics or section three school specific conditions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8166.669s">The</a> reason that I ask is because I don't think anybody is posing questions about section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8176.309s">The</a> superintendent is doing that today and I haven't heard anybody suggest that she should not continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8181.614s">I</a> think the clarifications that we are talking about are solely around the community health metrics driving a closure.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8222.784s">Who's</a> second? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8223.905s">I'm</a> still not, I guess I'm just not clear on what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8229.148s">Like</a> if we're saying classroom, if we're saying school based on section three, which are school specific conditions, but if we're saying based on our like red, yellow, green, our positivity rate, et cetera, to me, those are two different questions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8347.155s">And</a> I think the nuance is that that's true today for pro classroom program level closures. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8359.164s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8360.033s">And</a> I don't personally have any issue with that, but I do think that this committee should convene if we are going to make decisions based on our community health metrics at the very minimum to take public comment before we make such a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8378.264s">So</a> to me, I don't want to say, I do not want to vote no to a blanket. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8383.927s">Does</a> Dr. Edouard-Vincent have authority, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8388.4s">I</a> do not want to have to do that, but I am uncomfortable that we could foresee a situation where we go red, we are red for four, five, six weeks, and no formal discussion of this committee is had. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8410.325s">To</a> weigh those decisions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8439.633s">That's</a> your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8440.373s">I</a> think it's very different when we are talking about things happening inside a school building versus what we are talking about when we are making decisions about the impacts on our schools of metrics that are reflective of the community around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8458.397s">I</a> don't want to close schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8460.078s">I</a> don't want anyone to think that I want to close schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8464.04s">What</a> I do want is if we are faced with a real possibility of that, I want to have a conversation about it and a collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8472.846s">I</a> feel like part of the reason why we have <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8475.847s">been</a> so successful is because we started out in a collaborative fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8480.03s">I</a> do not feel comfortable putting this all on Dr. Edouard-Vincent's shoulders because as soon as something goes sideways, everyone will be caught in the community will not be praising her anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8493.021s">They</a> will be calling for her head. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8494.462s">And</a> it is unfair of us as a committee to put all of that on her personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8500.947s">when</a> all I am asking is that before such a decision is made, we have a collaborative conversation about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8508.07s">That's</a> all I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8509.19s">I</a> don't think that is unreasonable.<h2><a href="../2020-11-18_vuekGeCcKsE/2020-11-18_vuekGeCcKsE.html">Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=314.75s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=316.491s">Member</a> Graham here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=317.732s">Member</a> van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=318.953s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=320.133s">And</a> Member Mustone is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=323.035s">And</a> instead, Member Ruseau?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1687.493s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1689.474s">Susanna,</a> I think my question is, did we make a conscious decision that we were going to build this incrementally over time instead of purchasing a curriculum that would put in place exactly what you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1709.924s">So</a> it strikes me that the, I heard wonderful things about the professional development, but it strikes me that <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1717.055s">the</a> output of the professional development was so that people could go off and like build their own stuff, which is okay, but it's not sort of foolproof in that we can't guarantee that we are covering the curriculum in a linked and progressive fashion if every teacher is off independently creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1740.913s">So</a> I'm just curious, like what research we did to decide that we weren't going to <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1746.403s">buy</a> something and instead we were going to build this way.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1814.849s">Oh,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1815.689s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1816.149s">And</a> I, I think the professional development is critical because I, without it, you can't do that authentically, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1826.3s">I</a> think the professional development piece is sort of different, at least in my mind, than the curriculum piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1834.443s">If</a> we have 10 topics we wanna cover and we don't have a curriculum that sort of does scope and sequence to cover those 10 topics, how are we sure we didn't miss a topic somewhere that we should have covered? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1851.328s">I</a> guess that's, so I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1853.732s">I</a> think the professional development is important for all the reasons you just described, but to me, that's sort of a different discussion than choosing to incrementally build things voluntarily versus identifying what the need is and determining, and maybe there's nothing out there, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1875.257s">I</a> just was curious if you guys had looked at all of that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1968.032s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1969.072s">Yeah,</a> no, that's super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1972.955s">I</a> guess, so do we have a framework? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1975.477s">Like,</a> are we working toward a framework of, like, here is what we want to be teaching at each grade level? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1983.203s">Like,</a> has that... <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1985.275s">been</a> articulated and Susana, I think you sort of said you needed support from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1992.599s">So</a> I'm interested in what that is, what support it is that we could provide.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2388.845s">So,</a> I guess sort of one thing that I was thinking about as you were talking, Susanna, and to Paulette's point, <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2398.915s">are</a> there contractual levers that would allow us to make a PD like this required over some stretch of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2412.863s">Because</a> I think that's like one starting gate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2415.424s">Like</a> this PD is really important and it was well-received, but it is fundamentally voluntary at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2421.587s">So</a> is there some lever <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2425.065s">in</a> the contract that we would have to like kind of tug on to say, this is going from something that's voluntary to something that's required in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2435.688s">And</a> I don't know if anyone has the answer to that question, but that certainly is a question that I have about how to make sure that we do sort of expose everybody to this professional development, because it, like I said, it sounds like it was incredibly well done and informative.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2581.909s">Yeah,</a> I think that's great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2625.743s">And</a> then the other thing I was thinking about, Susanna, as you were talking particularly about the ELA curricula, this committee has an agenda item to create sort of an audit or a catalog of all our curricula and whether they are meeting our needs or not, and whether we are gonna start seeking new curricula and various components <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2651.274s">So</a> I'm sort of wondering, Paulette, if we prioritize the ELA and literacy block for lots of reasons, but I think one of them is this sort of natural tie to say, have we evaluated our current curriculum with a lens of how does it help advance our objectives about disability awareness? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2674.355s">And</a> if it doesn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2676.092s">Are</a> there others out there that do a better job of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2678.853s">So</a> that that becomes part of our criteria as we look at our ELA curriculum at various levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2685.014s">So</a> there might be a way to add some supports there that like you said, like there's like little nuggets of it in the journeys curriculum, but probably not nearly enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2695.616s">So</a> how do we think about that when we think about whether the journeys curriculum is the right curriculum for us?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3617.976s">I</a> would like to make that motion.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3626.987s">But</a> I particularly want to make sure that what those budgetary considerations are come to us long before June. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3635.893s">So</a> perhaps there's a way for us to have the motion say that as part of the budget request <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3644.638s">that</a> comes to us from, maybe it's the special education budget, that there will be a line item ask in your request to cover the work that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3659.929s">I</a> can do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3663.692s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3664.993s">Member</a> Van der Kloot?

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=328.102s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1822.081s">On</a> the playgrounds, we passed a resolution at our March 9th meeting to establish this playground advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1831.644s">And</a> the goal of that committee was not only to be part of the process around the McGlynn Playground Design Study, but also to look at all of our playgrounds for the ways in which we may have had small opportunities to make the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1850.628s">you</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1851.818s">more</a> playful and accessible and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1854.439s">And</a> I was surprised to see the playgrounds all dug up when I was by one of the elementary schools the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1861.461s">So</a> I feel like the intent and spirit of that resolution was that that committee would be formed before any work got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1869.464s">So</a> we have passed that gate now, but I would ask that that committee be formed before an RFP goes out to bid, because if we don't have good requirements in the RFP bid, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1881.195s">in</a> terms of what our vision of making sure that the design firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1886.978s">are</a> including the right folks, know how to engage the community, et cetera, then we will have missed yet another gate where we could have had community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1897.344s">We</a> had a really great meeting in early March with a number of people who were interested in this discussion, who had really wonderful and particular ideas about how to do this at all of our playgrounds, not necessarily just at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1911.473s">And</a> I know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1914.054s">Shortly</a> after that, things changed radically. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1916.576s">We</a> actually on our April 6 meeting talked about moving the date out a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1921.401s">And</a> so we're obviously well past that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1923.703s">But</a> I would ask that before an RFP go out, we go back to the resolution that was passed on March 9 and make sure that that committee is formed so that they can be part of the review of what that RFP is asking for and seeking. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1939.043s">Um,</a> because we have already missed some opportunities in my opinion to have potentially, um, resurface those playgrounds with, um, with opportunities potentially that we now don't have because we have resurfaced those playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1954.916s">So,</a> um, I would ask that we sort of cycle back to that original intent and make sure that we engage the community before we move forward further. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1970.768s">And</a> then I did have another question about the minutes of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1975.232s">I</a> feel a little bit lost because I feel like the discussion about the facade of the high school is sort of rolling full steam ahead when we put on hold the vision committee and said that we were going to reform that in this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1994.898s">I</a> guess I'm trying to understand how those things fit together and why we would invest in changes to the facade of the building when we haven't made decisions about the vision for the high school as a larger unit in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2012.871s">And</a> I'm just wondering when that committee of the whole is scheduled for, for the vision committee.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2161.027s">And</a> there's reference in the minutes to these design drawings that weren't included in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2168.495s">And</a> I just wondered if somebody could include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2170.417s">Sounds</a> like <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2171.273s">It's</a> really great work and I definitely would want to see us invite the people who have already participated to be part of the application process for the vision committee, which we can talk about next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2182.677s">But</a> I'm really curious to sort of see and envision what it might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2187.739s">But</a> to your point about installing bricks and not having a bigger plan, I think that's why the vision committee is so critical because every expenditure that we talk about, bathrooms, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2200.863s">you</a> know all kinds of things really should you know should be tied into like where does this where does this fit in our sort of master plan which we don't really have right now so I definitely want to see us prioritize that because I think it answers a lot of questions and helps guide us into the future if we take the time to have a thoughtful conversation about that vision sooner rather than later and I know we're already you know <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2229.8s">unavoidably</a> delayed that discussion, but I think that's really important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2279.428s">And</a> then Kathy, in your notes, you also referenced that we have run out of money for the projects that we're going to be paid for out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2287.613s">But</a> I don't recall that your notes said what the next steps were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2293.157s">If</a> we're running out of money, what does that mean for those projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2295.739s">Does</a> it mean they don't happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2298.981s">Does</a> it mean we do half of a project? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2300.682s">Like,</a> what is the plan?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2738.851s">Mayor,</a> I'm gonna make a motion to table these to our next meeting if they can be added to the next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2744.493s">Susie</a> asked me to include some additional things in the minutes and I did not get a chance to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2751.315s">So</a> I wanna do that before we provide the updated report to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2756.177s">So</a> if I could make a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2758.486s">Motion</a> to table, seconded by Member McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6309.918s">What's</a> our current positivity rate? 0.96%. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6314.891s">And</a> how does Tufts multi times a week testing factoring into that positivity rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6322.195s">It</a> seems like it would be inflating the low number or deflating the number.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6342.827s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6343.44s">So</a> our positivity numbers are garbage. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6349.542s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6349.982s">They're</a> heavily weighted to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6354.484s">Or</a> are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6356.304s">How</a> many tests are happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6360.206s">Two</a> per student, but most they're- But I mean in Medford in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6364.127s">And</a> what percentage of it is Tufts?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6387.79s">Okay,</a> I'm not in favor of hanging our hat on a number that is problematic at best, but that's just me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6731.827s">At</a> every meeting, we get a verbal update with a bunch of numbers that get tossed our way, but those numbers don't ever get reported in formal fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6744.471s">I'm</a> a numbers person, but I'm not a numbers person who can just ingest numbers spoken at me and be able to like simultaneously interpret those and remember them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6753.873s">I've</a> already forgotten what Tony said 15 minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6756.314s">Can</a> we, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6760.641s">When</a> we talk about the metrics dashboard, we spent a tremendous amount of time putting that together so that at any point in time, anybody could go look at it and understand where we were at. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6772.006s">And</a> we have not kept up our end of the bargain from that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6775.848s">We</a> are not publishing that on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6778.469s">or</a> not filling it out the way that we said that we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6780.671s">And</a> I think we need to start to do that in addition to revisiting what we thought were the right metrics at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6789.177s">I</a> will not vote for anything that just arbitrarily rolls back and puts <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6796.261s">this</a> decision in the hands of a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6799.422s">That's</a> not where I'm at personally, but I would like to see us commit to actually publishing data to the community so people can make good decisions for their own family. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6810.144s">It</a> appears that we are taking the position that because we have provided options, everyone gets to sort of fend for themselves and make their own choices, which <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6822.267s">may</a> be fine, that may be workable for lots of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6826.469s">But</a> I just want to point out, our numbers are as bad as they were in April when the instruction was don't leave your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6832.952s">So</a> all of a sudden, we're all out caring about our business, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6839.995s">But</a> our numbers aren't that different than when we weren't supposed to leave our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6844.817s">And</a> now we're saying school is not transmitting things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6849.399s">Which</a> again, if that's true, it's great, but I would like to be able to sit with the numbers and understand that for myself, which I can't do when it's just sort of spoken at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6860.713s">I'd</a> like to understand how complete the data set is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6863.257s">So</a> at various times we hear that <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6868.182s">contact</a> tracing is complicated because people are not cooperating. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6871.423s">Well,</a> if people are not cooperating, how are we concluding that school-based transmission is not a thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6877.565s">And</a> then back to member Rousseau's point earlier tonight, like we don't know that somebody who's asymptomatic and test positive has only had the virus for two days, but yet we're using that and frankly providing instruction to people to not <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6892.43s">worry</a> too much beyond two days when that may not be a good thing for our community spread anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6900.22s">And</a> I just think this warrants a bigger conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6902.623s">I</a> will say that I am, I think anyway based on what I can recall about the information that's been shared with us, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6910.072s">I'm</a> surprised that we haven't seen more spread than we have seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6914.657s">Maybe</a> that's because we have welcomed our youngest learners who have the least amount of, I'll say free will about how they move about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6924.347s">Maybe</a> that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6925.829s">Maybe</a> when we welcome back some of our <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6929.252s">more</a> mobile students who have freedoms to move about as they see fit that we will see something very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6938.379s">And</a> I don't think anybody, you know, and certainly not me, I don't want to see us have to close, but I want us to be clear about what it would look like if we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6950.368s">And</a> I don't want that to feel like an arbitrary decision made by anybody because there shouldn't be anything arbitrary about how we make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6960.092s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we're doing our due diligence as a committee, not putting this weight on the superintendent because that's not what we should be here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6971.376s">But</a> I think it should be a collaborative decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6973.377s">And</a> I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6974.817s">We</a> need to properly post that this is what we're going to talk about, because there are a number of members of the community who I believe are not here tonight that would want to speak about this, either to say to stick with what we have or to change it or to do something else completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6989.402s">And</a> I think we owe the community that courtesy as we have this conversation so I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6996.955s">I</a> think Member Ruseau made a motion to schedule a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7000.118s">It</a> doesn't have to be an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7002.72s">It</a> can be no to 72 hours out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7004.922s">That's</a> fine by me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7006.244s">But</a> I do think we need to have a meeting where we revisit what we're publishing, how we're publishing it, and what those metrics are that are going to drive us forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7621.662s">A</a> point of information, section three is not filled out and it never has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7626.286s">So</a> there's some, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7629.292s">blanket</a> language there, which is not the intent of what that section is supposed to contain. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7634.658s">And</a> I've brought this up multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7636.44s">It's</a> never been populated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7637.821s">So</a> when I say we're not even populating the things that we said we would do, that is what I'm specifically referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7644.529s">And</a> so even if the metrics are updated as of last week, the dashboard is incomplete and it always has been.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11027.037s">I</a> think you're on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11028.238s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11030.42s">My</a> understanding is that the vast majority of remote kids at the elementary level experience changes, not just maybe some, but that almost all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11039.266s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11045.531s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11046.552s">And</a> you know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11050.89s">I</a> don't think that change was met with a lot of favor by remote families. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11056.932s">I</a> have heard people say that part of the reason why this shift is happening is to provide capacity in the buildings to cover classes that aren't being able to be taught in the building like music. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11068.995s">So</a> we're using specialists to support proctoring essentially and taking, so taking <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11078.889s">away</a> known teachers from remote students to proctor other specialist classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11084.99s">Is</a> that happening?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11167.538s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11171.339s">And</a> I've heard the administration say a couple of times, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11178.455s">that</a> they have or haven't received feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11182.797s">And</a> I'm just curious how you are soliciting that feedback because I actually heard today from a number of parents who in some of the larger classrooms are pretty disenchanted with the experience that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11196.944s">So</a> I'm just curious what actions the administration is taking to solicit input.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11234.605s">I</a> think as a district, we need to think carefully about how we are reaching out to families who are part of this educational equation in a way that they never have been before. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11248.169s">And</a> we talk about that a lot, but I'd like to see us actually engage families in this discussion in a more <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11259.58s">meaningful</a> way so that we can do more than just assume that because we haven't received a complaint that everything is that all is well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11269.007s">because</a> I think in some cases, all is actually well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11271.868s">And</a> I think in other cases, the reasons why all isn't well are fixable and just completely unaddressed because no one is reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11281.111s">So,</a> I've heard like at the middle school level, people say sometimes they're kids who are at home, whether they're at home because they're cohort B or cohort C or cohort D, can't hear what's going on in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11296.459s">And,</a> um, but I don't know that we have any sort of window into what those, what those issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11303.103s">Um,</a> in that case, it's pretty fixable. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11305.164s">We're</a> field testing microphones. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11306.965s">Hopefully</a> we have a fix on the way, but there's, there's other stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11310.487s">That's</a> so fixable. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11311.627s">If</a> we take the time to ask the questions and I'm just concerned that we're not, we are not asking the questions and maybe that's a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11319.531s">Maybe</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11321.768s">Maybe</a> it's something else entirely, but I would like to see us actually engage the other adults that are responsible for education right now because they have no choice, obviously, in understanding from them what they're seeing and how that might help us all continue to improve.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11885.907s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11887.028s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11889.909s">Dave,</a> when you say the numbers in the 20s, that's across elementary and middle, or does that include the high school?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11899.195s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11937.486s">Mayor,</a> can I ask a quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11940.528s">We</a> didn't cover this during Joan's presentation, but in our packet, there was something that said update regarding plan for most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11949.355s">And</a> it referenced a contingency plan, but I didn't see it attached in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11953.378s">I</a> just saw what looked like a cover memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11957.061s">Did</a> I miss a document? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11960.003s">No,</a> it was just the memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11962.625s">Is</a> a contingency plan forthcoming?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11970.98s">I</a> don't see a contingency plan in the memo.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12013.012s">Maybe,</a> I know this came out of comments that I made, maybe I should be more clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12017.255s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that a contingency plan be created in the event that we have to send our most vulnerable students remote en masse. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12027.103s">That</a> is the contingency plan that I believe that we need to have.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12124.687s">what</a> the plan is if that is entirely not an option is is that yes this specific yes yes so and and i know that every student has their own plan that is not the plan that i'm asking for i believe that as a district we need to have a framework that says that if if <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12147.057s">a</a> whole building has to be shut down, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12149.758s">Like</a> that could be a reason why our most vulnerable have to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12153.778s">Maybe</a> there's something that has happened in a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12158.019s">Are</a> there services that can transition to Zoom seamlessly because we have that experience? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12163.941s">We</a> did it in the summer during ESY. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12166.841s">Are</a> there certain services that just simply can't be done that way and we want to find alternative ways to continue to conduct them in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12174.936s">So</a> to me, it's not about like what every individual student needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12178.937s">It's</a> about the services we're providing and which of those services would we need to sort of protect in some way so that they can continue to happen in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12189.041s">Which</a> of the services can we transition and what is our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12193.223s">The</a> entire point and purpose of having a contingency plan is that when that thing happens that you're not <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12200.545s">planning</a> for, like sending all remote kids home, that you don't start from that day and have to work to create a plan and a structure and a way to get things going again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12213.895s">So</a> the whole point of having a contingency plan is to have a jump on whatever that thing is that you're not planning for, so that you know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12222.853s">And</a> all I'm asking is that we think about these students, and frankly, how much we don't know about how this will impact all our students, but particularly our most vulnerable in the long run, and have some level of a plan in the eventuality, or maybe not, that we have to send everybody home. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12243.304s">I</a> mean, I think lots and lots of people think it's an inevitability that we will all end up back at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12249.727s">Whether</a> you think that or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12251.887s">The</a> only downside of having a contingency plan is that you spent time thinking through what the contingency plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12259.554s">There's</a> absolutely no downside to being prepared and I hope we would never have to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12264.239s">But</a> if we do, I don't wanna be delayed in providing services to these students.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12344.93s">I</a> think it does for some services, but the value of a contingency plan is to have a full catalog of what your services are so you know what the specific plan is for each and every one of the services that you have to provide to support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12359.278s">So</a> yeah, I think perhaps that is the contingency plan for some number of services, but it's not the whole contingency plan, or at least it shouldn't be.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12502.117s">So</a> to be clear, I would like evidence that the district is prepared to continue to meet our legal obligations <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12511.822s">if</a> and when we have to go full remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12515.685s">I</a> would like some evidence to give me confidence as a member of this school committee that we are prepared to do right by these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12525.994s">even</a> if the unforeseen happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12528.236s">So</a> yeah, I think that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12531.479s">I</a> mean, that is the overarching question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12534.582s">Like,</a> are we prepared to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12536.363s">Can</a> we provide assurances to the families of these students that their services will continue <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12543.892s">and</a> that it won't take us weeks or months to do that, that we will be prepared seamlessly to transition in one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12551.177s">I</a> would like some evidence to tell me that, and this particular report made me think I was missing a document because it doesn't provide any specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=12561.323s">So</a> that is what I'm looking for.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=13130.6s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=13134.561s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor with a second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=13151.568s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that a contingency plan be developed to assure that we are prepared in the event of an emergency district-wide closure to continue to provide services to our most vulnerable population.<h2><a href="../2020-11-10_3tlRdpeIbkM/2020-11-10_3tlRdpeIbkM.html">Communications, Strategy & Stakeholder Engagement Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=154.232s">Member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=155.252s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=156.213s">And</a> member Graham here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=157.273s">So</a> three present. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=159.774s">The</a> meeting objectives for today are really to focus specifically on <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=164.152s">Um,</a> kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=165.632s">So</a> to discuss plans for kindergarten information sessions, enrollment plans, and community outreach, um, to address the below approved motion of the school committee from back in February, which is the school committee refers our kindergarten orientation practices to the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=182.555s">The</a> subcommittee will conduct current communication and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=187.316s">We'll</a> review current communication and community engagement practices related to kindergarten orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=192.021s">The</a> subcommittee will recommend revisions to the current plan and or approach to the school committee by September 20th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=198.245s">So</a> we're obviously outside of that target date given COVID, but we did in our planning meeting last month, talk about this being a specific topic of discussion that we will go through today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=213.756s">So</a> we have a couple of folks from the community who have joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=220.027s">And</a> the first item on the agenda is really to talk about our district timeline and how we compare to some surrounding areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=230.411s">So</a> I actually did a little bit of research to try to get some of that information so that we could have a productive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=241.135s">And</a> I actually went out and I'm gonna share this document with you all because I think it's easier to see in a chart form <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=250.303s">So</a> one of the things that I did was put together sort of, and I'll say my recall of our typical kindergarten orientation practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=259.728s">And</a> we had some brief discussion about this at the last meeting, but we can start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=265.351s">And</a> then I also have some information about districts around us and what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=269.973s">So</a> while we wait for Dr. Edouard-Vincent to join, I figured we can go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=275.456s">Can</a> you all see my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=278.998s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=281.231s">So</a> as far as I understand our current process, registration typically opens in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=290.739s">Then</a> in March and April, we have a presentation called Bridges to Kindergarten, which is like a parent information <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=298.593s">session</a> about what to expect in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=302.374s">And</a> then the kindergarten visiting day where students and families are invited in for a short time to experience what it's like in the school that happens in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=315.136s">Our</a> kindergarten screenings actually don't happen until September. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=319.237s">And</a> generally speaking, we do not formally entertain tours <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=328.485s">of</a> our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=331.427s">So</a> that's my understanding of the current process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=333.708s">But</a> before we go on, I fully admit that I could be incomplete about sort of my understanding of what our practices are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=342.292s">So</a> if anyone has anything else that they want to toss into the conversation, we can add that now.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=368.636s">Peter,</a> do you know, did we do any sort of virtual tours last spring during the pandemic?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=381.92s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=383.356s">Okay,</a> so I don't think we've done virtual tours in the past, which, and I did, I have that down as sort of a revised step, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=395.619s">So</a> hang on to that thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=399.3s">The</a> other thing I did, and I think you can see it, it's just a comparison of some of our neighboring districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=409.298s">Basically,</a> what I tried to do was just get an understanding of what schools around us were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=415.543s">If</a> you recall from the conversation back in February, which might have been a few million light years away, we were talking about this in the context of, in particular, families weighing charter schools as an option and having to make those decisions about charter schools long before we even start our processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=437.601s">I</a> did actually go out to two of the local charter schools that is sort of my impression are the biggest charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=443.326s">So</a> the first being Mystic Valley and the second being Prospect Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=447.79s">Their</a> registration processes are, Mystic Valley's process is open and it has been open for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=455.676s">And</a> their lottery submissions are due on January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=459.339s">So</a> anybody who's considering go, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=465.588s">trying</a> to get through the lottery process at Mystic Valley, their applications are due on January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=472.972s">They</a> do host open houses traditionally starting in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=477.915s">Their</a> website didn't talk about tours explicitly and their website also didn't have any content like specifically oriented to kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=487.78s">Prospect</a> Hills registration process seemed a little to slide back a little bit and <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=493.172s">really</a> be lottery in March, so applications due in late February. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=499.014s">But</a> on their website, there was definitely a clear place for you to request information about an open house or even tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=508.477s">And</a> there was definitely some specific content about kindergarten on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=513.847s">So</a> then I went and looked at some of the area districts and what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=518.628s">I</a> wasn't successful in collecting information in all cases, but there were a couple that were sort of interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=528.531s">For</a> Melrose, their registration process opens in February and they are a feeder school to Mystic Valley as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=538.194s">But</a> their open houses start in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=539.974s">So</a> they do open houses, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=543.55s">January,</a> February, there did appear to be options for tours in February, and then registration starts in February as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=551.893s">They</a> did have kindergarten-specific content on their website over in Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=558.915s">Wakefield</a> was similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=561.136s">They</a> actually opened their registration late January, early February, and they had some informational meetings starting in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=569.417s">And</a> then Somerville actually, what I have been able to glean is the first thing that they do is they email eligible families who have kindergarten and eligible students for the upcoming school year in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=585.086s">Their</a> registration process starts on January 12th, but they also start info sessions in November and they appear to be doing some virtual tours even before January rolls around. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=598.442s">That</a> was what I was able to sort of glean from neighboring districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=601.584s">So</a> I'll stop there and just ask if there's any questions or other comments or things we want to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=627.037s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=629.411s">The</a> next piece on the agenda was really for us to talk about things we may want to do in the future in this process, really around our outreach plans and our timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=642.699s">A</a> couple of things that came up in our last meeting was the discussion around the usage of census data and how we might use that in our process, which seems to be what Somerville is doing on their end. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=655.247s">And</a> then also we talked a lot about <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=658.055s">community</a> resources like Medford Family Network and reaching out to area preschools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=663.977s">So</a> what I wanted to do today was talk a little bit about other thoughts that we had in terms of outreach plans, things that we're thinking would make this process more effective given that we do appear to be a fairly late process as it compares to, in particular, the charter schools that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=689.542s">competing</a> against, I guess is like sort of an awkward way to put it, but where some students from Medford ultimately go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=696.987s">So</a> I just wanted to open the floor for other thoughts about outreach plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=705.033s">And</a> if any of the community members who have joined us have thoughts that they'd like to share, I'd like to sort of open it up to you all as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=716.161s">Member</a> McLaughlin.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=868.007s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=869.188s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=870.208s">So,</a> um, we, um, we actually looked, um, before you jumped on at what some of the, um, area cities and particularly the charter schools are doing in terms of their relative timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=884.616s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=885.738s">And</a> I picked these cities just like more for your information. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=889.42s">These</a> are all feeder communities to Mystic Valley in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=892.923s">So</a> I was just curious what some of those folks were doing to start to think about like where could we line up our practices a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=910.134s">So</a> we were just talking about things that we could be doing that <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=916.008s">would</a> move the timeline a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=919.691s">And</a> Jennifer, I think you have a new K student this year, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=925.658s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=926.598s">So,</a> um, as the resident, um, kindergarten parent on the phone, I wondered if you would just be willing to share sort of in your recall of what happened and obviously like sort of the pandemic definitely got in the way of things, but, um, what was your reaction to the, to the process as you went through it and what were the things that you were thinking about along the way? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=950.502s">And</a> am I correct in remembering that you are also a teacher?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1093.662s">No,</a> I think that was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1094.843s">Thank</a> you for sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1097.244s">And</a> I think one of the things that we talked a little bit about in the last meeting was this idea that we should be proactively reaching out to prospective kindergarten families through the census and setting some expectations about what <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1123.138s">Um,</a> what's to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1124.419s">And</a> I think one of the things that happened last year, although I'm going to guess it wasn't necessarily on the roadmap was we went to, um, online registration, um, out of necessity, but now that it's here, we've worked out those processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1139.545s">I</a> think it gives us some interesting opportunity when we think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1142.707s">Um,</a> being proactive, um, really even, even now, even in November and in December in some way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1153.287s">to</a> let people know what's coming and what we're expecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1155.928s">So</a> I certainly wanna see us explore some sort of mailing to be actively reaching out to families via the census information, which I know we have to sort of work with city hall to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1171.214s">But</a> if we can be reaching out for that reason, even in early December, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1178.627s">I</a> think we sort of get ahead of what becomes an annual set of questions on social media about what's happening, when does it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1189.753s">How</a> does it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1190.734s">Who</a> do I talk to? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1191.754s">How</a> do I get X or Y or Z? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1194.516s">Perhaps</a> there's a way for us to put a letter together and maybe there are some nice quotes from people who have been through the process even this year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1204.941s">Where</a> it's so unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1207.19s">that</a> could be styled into the outreach just to let families know what's coming and what the plan is for this year in terms of registration and onboarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1219.06s">So</a> that's certainly something that I would like to see us bring forward to the school committee and recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1225.025s">But</a> I also think we talked a little bit last time about some sort of Q&A sessions happening and <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1236.437s">perhaps</a> even before the Bridges to Kindergarten presentations, which used to happen in like March and April, I feel like those even should slide back into like the February timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1247.079s">So</a> this is just, this section is just sort of my thinking about all of this and happy to tweak and change any of this based on this discussion, but it was just sort of a starting point to say, how could we be thinking about this and what is reasonable for us to try to achieve this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1264.083s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1266.644s">really</a> thinking about how do we start the process in December so that we are ahead of those lottery dates that are as early as January 4th, actually this year, over at Mystic Valley, so that when people are looking for information, they can have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1291.539s">Thoughts</a> about December ideas, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1295.381s">Glucy?</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1369.121s">And</a> the online registration, I'm making an assumption that it's sort of good to go for forever more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1376.968s">Is</a> that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1377.608s">I</a> didn't want to assume that, but yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1380.15s">And</a> is it intensely manual on the back end or
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1454.145s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1455.546s">I</a> guess I'm not sure I'm clear on like the the lift or how viable it is to do some sort of video like cross schools video tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1467.954s">Really,</a> I mean, December, January is like right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1470.855s">I</a> don't know if that's a big lift or a little lift or <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1475.745s">I</a> think what I would call her.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1668.962s">Yeah,</a> I think it would be great to be able to publish something on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1674.424s">on</a> the website so that if somebody is reading, like I was actually today going out to all these websites and saying, who even has kindergarten specific content on their website? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1683.689s">And</a> it was a bit of a mixed bag, but there were places who I think did a good job of describing kindergarten on their website, or at least in a sort of, I'll say simple way, but it was something to grab onto, particularly if you are a new family to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1701.769s">I</a> did like what Melrose had out on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1704.531s">It</a> was simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1707.213s">I</a> don't think it would be like overly complicated to publish something global, but I think even some of those FAQs that certainly churn up a lot of questions over time and in all kinds of different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1723.544s">that</a> would be great as well to be able to have that on the school website level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1730.313s">So</a> I think that would be really meaningful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1737.563s">The</a> other <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1742.705s">I</a> was sort of making an assumption that there would be no tours this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1747.068s">So</a> in terms of like the notes and things we would be doing when we report this out to the school committee, I was making an assumption there would be no tours planned for this year, at least not at this point, but that, you know, perhaps these other things that we're putting in place could sort of help bridge that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1769.097s">I</a> guess one question I had is like, when do we plan to open registration for students? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1775.378s">Or</a> if we had thought about that, I mean, I think it would be great if we could open that in January, especially because it is online this year, but I don't know how that fits in with all the other processes that have to happen to start to officially sort of pull people into the district.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1966.76s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=1997.817s">Yeah,</a> I mean, one of the things that I heard and it's certainly not since the pandemic, but pre pandemic is that there didn't appear to be a process to reliably <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2013.13s">request</a> a tour and have somebody engage with you about how that might happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2018.314s">So</a> I heard, you know, I've heard from families, I asked for a tour and no one got back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2024.158s">And</a> I think part of that could simply be who <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2029.391s">Who</a> did you ask and did that person have the right tools to say yes or no to that request? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2037.759s">And</a> so maybe as we think about post-pandemic options, if there was a structure in place that would allow us to give tours, maybe Wednesdays are a good day to do that under our current time out on Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2054.253s">Or</a> maybe there's other, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2056.255s">you</a> know other times on a monthly basis or something where those tours could happen but just to think about how do we make sure that not only that we have these options but that there's like a clear path to access the option so that we don't have people in the community thinking that we're being non-responsive but instead that there's you know there's a clear protocol if you want a tour this is how you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2083.194s">I</a> think one of the schools had a like <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2086.289s">a</a> form like a Google form that said, fill it out here and tell us what you are looking for from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2091.593s">And</a> then presumably there was some process on the back end that they could, you know, engage with those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2096.777s">So</a> perhaps there just has to be an actual way to ask for those things as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2101.841s">So</a> that we centrally have a good feeling that those things are happening when they're being requested, and that we can keep tabs on the fact that we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2111.704s">like</a> burdening any particular school or building principal or administrator to try to sort of manage all of this, that there can be a more systemic approach to doing some of those things, which I think would be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2134.811s">I</a> also had on this list that sort of everything would slide back into like a slightly earlier spot in the year with online registration happening as early as January. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2147.1s">And</a> then those bridges to kindergarten presentations may be happening in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2150.623s">I</a> wasn't sure if that felt like a good timeline for you all in terms of what those activities are that <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2160.59s">It</a> takes to sort of put on bridges to kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2163.212s">I'm</a> sort of assuming some of it's going to be virtual again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2167.755s">The</a> reason I think it's important for us to sort of spec out the timeline is because if we're gonna send something out in December, I would want that letter to be able to say, this is sort of when you can expect things to be happening like Bridges to Kindergarten, because a truly new family would not even know to expect something like Bridges to Kindergarten unless we've told them that that is something that's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2190.661s">So</a> just trying to think about that with an eye toward like, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2196.263s">something</a> going out in December is sort of where my head was at as I was trying to think through all of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2207.109s">One</a> thing I was not sure about was whether we needed to officially recommend to the school committee that we adopt <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2220.197s">that</a> we asked the school administration to work with the city to collect the census information to be able to enable that mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2231.686s">I</a> wrote a resolution that we can talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2234.268s">I</a> wasn't 100% sure how was the best way to do that, but if we think it's necessary, I wrote it so that it was easy enough for us to adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2246.335s">If</a> we don't think it's necessary, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2248.756s">I</a> just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2249.577s">I</a> didn't know Dr. Edward Benson, if that helps sort of move things along more fluidly when we're sort of crossing outside of the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2260.663s">bounds</a> that the school committee is officially saying, yes, we're behind this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2482.017s">Oh,</a> Lisa, did you have a question?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2525.104s">Okay,</a> so I know that we fill out a Medford census every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2529.888s">I</a> mean, I'm sure it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2533.008s">I'm</a> sure the data is not quite as complex and rigorous, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2542.373s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2542.953s">But</a> in that census, and I think this is what Mr. Murphy was talking about in the last meeting, in that information, you do outline all the members of your household and their ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2556.019s">So</a> there is data. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2557.18s">I'm</a> not, it sounds like it may be in the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2561.84s">So</a> I sort of think that one of the things that we should do out of this meeting is vote on this resolution and bring it forward as an output of the meeting for the larger school committee to vote on so that we know that the entire committee is in agreement that we should be sort of actively promoting this mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2584.155s">Because</a> I think without this information, it becomes harder to mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2588.738s">We</a> can rely on what Marie Cassidy has, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2591.928s">it</a> definitely will not reach everybody.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2706.031s">Member</a> McLaughlin.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2827.333s">I</a> just wanna be mindful of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2828.814s">The</a> other thing that I had on the agenda was some discussion about a survey of impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2836.159s">So</a> I think when we started this discussion, it was really around how, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2842.43s">we</a> weren't even beginning our process until after many of the charter schools were already like sort of well down their path, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2850.234s">So</a> I think sliding this whole timeline and doing some of these things that we've talked about will make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2856.697s">But</a> I also would like us to think about how do we provide some sort of survey <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2864.46s">Maybe</a> like in July or something that allows people to tell us in a more formal way that they felt like they got what they needed from the process or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2874.884s">And</a> I feel like the sort of the farther away you get from the timeline at the harder it becomes to remember sort of how you were feeling in the moment right like either you <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2885.132s">either</a> you remember it fondly or you remember it like in a more escalated way, even than it was happening in your world at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2893.876s">So</a> I would like to see us also... <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2897.616s">do</a> a survey and think about how do we ask the right questions, both of those families who registered and those who didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2908.625s">So</a> if we start with census data, we know all the people who have potential enrollees <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2916.03s">and</a> then we also could know who did enroll and we can ask them questions about the process and did they feel like the timeline sort of met their needs and those kinds of questions but also we could then target those families that didn't enroll to understand like why didn't they enroll and <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2939.897s">If</a> the answer of I didn't enroll because I moved, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2945.118s">But</a> if they didn't enroll because they chose another option for their child or children, we don't have any insight into what those issues are right now, except for sort of general <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2961.301s">anecdotal</a> information like I think Lisa at the last meeting you talked about child care being a big driver for some folks to go to charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2970.17s">I</a> think we should start to collect that data so that when we think about what are those impacts and how do we stop sending $7 million to charter schools like <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2982.058s">How</a> much money would we have to spend to save $7 million going to charter schools right is, is there some equation there that some action on our part or some programming could make a difference so I would also like to see us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=2997.559s">do</a> an official survey this year and really on an annual basis this could be sort of a trial run year where we're looking at if you registered sort of how did the process work and what would you want us to do differently but then also if you didn't register why not for us to start to collect information about like <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3020.419s">what</a> are those opportunities for us to make sure that our Medford kindergartners come to Medford public schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3028.486s">And</a> maybe there isn't an opportunity, but maybe there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3031.448s">And</a> I don't think we really have good data on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3035.072s">So</a> that was the other thing that I wanted to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3037.974s">I'm</a> totally open to discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3040.456s">Obviously,</a> it's not something that has to happen right now, but thoughts about survey? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3046.181s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3167.749s">I'm</a> just making a couple of notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3169.41s">Yeah,</a> and I think to your point, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3175.355s">The</a> place that I always look is on the cherry sheets for those numbers, but I don't even know if those are the like precise numbers because they are tied to enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3185.323s">So</a> those are just estimates is my understanding as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3188.406s">So</a> I think that's maybe a separate conversation that we should think about having. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3195.471s">And</a> maybe we can work on a resolution to do that in an upcoming meeting or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3203.055s">Um,</a> but certainly I think the, again, the sort of anecdotal conversation around charter school is certainly if you lose somebody at the kindergarten level, you have lost them times 13 years of fees leaving the district, um, which is why kindergarten is such a critical pivot point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3223.927s">So,</a> um, I do think doing some serving both for those families who enroll to make sure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3231.317s">we</a> can continue making small changes that meet the needs of the community, as well as really starting to think about those folks who are not enrolling and sort of why that is, I think would be really a helpful start from a kindergarten specific space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3249.202s">Lisa.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3490.364s">Any</a> other last thoughts about this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3494.447s">There</a> was at least one parent who said they had some thoughts and some comments, but wasn't able to come to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3503.433s">So</a> my plan is just that I will share out whatever those comments are at the meeting on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3508.636s">And</a> if we adjust the plan based on that, I think that's totally fine, but I wanna make sure that, I told her not to worry about trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3519.099s">get</a> me an email before the meeting that I would just include it afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3523.444s">Any</a> other questions, comments, thoughts about kindergarten?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3614.484s">No,</a> and I think that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3615.785s">I</a> think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3617.948s">When</a> I hear people talking about having questions, it's that they just don't know, and they don't even know where to go to get their answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3627.25s">So</a> I think if we do a better job of anticipating what those questions are, and I think we can be reasonably good at that, and letting people hear from us in a proactive way, I think that will go a long way to establishing a good foundation <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3645.876s">And</a> we've already written half the video right here live tonight, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3651.801s">Is</a> there a motion to adjourn?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3659.247s">Okay,</a> so I have to call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3661.029s">Member</a> McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3664.211s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3665.953s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3666.993s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3668.715s">And</a> Member Graham, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3671.997s">Motion</a> to adjourn is approved and I will see you all later. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3675.932s">Have</a> a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3676.797s">Thanks,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3tlRdpeIbkM&t=3677.34s">Bye.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-06-26_8oEn2KkMIiU/2025-06-26_8oEn2KkMIiU.html">Community Development Board 10-14-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3296.897s">That's</a> the one that I'm hung up on is social structures because that's like targeting a specific economic state of a neighborhood.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3689.366s">Yeah,</a> I can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3691.126s">I'd</a> like to be at that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4049.292s">The</a> design guidelines come from zoning or some master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4054.833s">But</a> the only other thing I was thinking in the interim is that you develop guidance for proponents of what to come prepared with at the presentations to our board to make it easier for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4071.016s">I</a> mean, that's sort of where we're always having
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4093.906s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I'm used to the city of Boston is very complex and they have built into their zoning, you know, there's specific articles of zoning dedicated to each neighborhood and within that neighborhood zoning, it has very specific design guidelines to be compatible with that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4112.39s">I</a> mean, that's very complex, but that's, unless you really wanna get into an overhaul like that in the city of Medford and look at different areas and neighborhoods, <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4124.237s">and</a> talk about neighborhood context and compatibility, that's a lot of work.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1133.124s">So</a> are you saying that that's because there's a data reporting issue, or are you saying that's because we just suspend everyone out of school? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1144.671s">I'm</a> not clear what your conclusion is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1173.755s">So</a> are you saying, I'm looking at, I think I'm looking at what you're referring to, Paul, and I'm looking at a grid that starts with all students and then it breaks down into subgroups. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1184.339s">All</a> students, 1,400 students for the 18-19 school year, 112 students disciplined, 0% in school suspension, 8% out of school suspension, 0% expulsion, 0% alternate setting, 0% emergency removal, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1204.112s">0%</a> students with school-based arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1206.554s">So</a> are you saying that that 8% should be distributed across all of those columns and that we are not accurately like categorizing and classifying what we're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1217.343s">Or</a> are you saying we simply don't do those other things?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1248.946s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1249.307s">So,</a> the data, it's not a data issue then, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1253.309s">So,</a> what you're saying is there aren't expulsions, so 0% makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1258.3s">Um,</a> there aren't alternate settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1259.982s">So</a> 0% makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1261.203s">So,</a> so this date, what this data says is that 8% of students receive out of 1400, 8% or 112 received an out of school suspension in the 2018, 2019 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1270.77s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1271.571s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1271.691s">And</a> this resolution is saying, we want that number to be zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1288.211s">in</a> favor of pick a different category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1294.175s">Is</a> that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1313.989s">I</a> can try. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1316.087s">I</a> don't know if I can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1317.268s">Let</a> me try.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1319.83s">I</a> think I have it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1320.711s">Let</a> me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1326.856s">Can</a> you see something?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1331.22s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1331.58s">Can</a> you see a chart that says 2018-2019 student discipline data report? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1339.246s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1340.908s">I've</a> got two screens, and I don't even know what I'm sharing at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1343.73s">So</a> tell me if it's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1345.586s">Not</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1348.168s">So</a> Melanie, I was reading across this top line, this all students line. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1355.012s">And</a> so what we're saying is the goal is to take this 8% to zero and to either move the punishment, I guess I'll call it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1370.871s">to</a> a setting where we can be focused on some of the things that Paul was saying we used to do and we don't do anymore, focusing on the rehabilitative aspects of what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1384.619s">I</a> think that's what we're trying to accomplish with this policy.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1975.803s">75%</a> of students are high needs students who are disciplined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1978.544s">So</a> of 112, 84 is 75%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1978.985s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1987.206s">75%</a> of students who are disciplined are high needs.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2215.311s">Stacey,</a> I actually think that that is the right way to go about getting at number five on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2225.417s">So</a> I still don't think that ending out of school suspensions is a bad sort of number one place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2235.502s">But</a> in terms of being able to accurately identify number five, an in-depth program review, so would <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2244.304s">allow</a> us to look at the data, as you said, like I agree, I think there's lots of data missing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2250.348s">Like</a> I would like to see lots more data than is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2253.81s">So</a> what I would suggest member Ruseau is that between four and five, we add something that says the administration will complete a comprehensive program review to identify the causes of suspension, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2273.079s">recommend</a> mitigation efforts so that number five can actually happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2278.204s">Because</a> otherwise, we're just throwing a number at the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2282.688s">And</a> we don't know if it's enough or if it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2285.75s">But</a> if we say, here's our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2289.554s">Here's</a> what it's going to take to address our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2292.296s">And</a> here's the money that we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2295.079s">Now</a> we have an actual path forward that is actionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2301.383s">So</a> that would be my suggestion is that we add that as another bullet in terms of what will happen to get us to this place next fall, where we do not want to be issuing out of school suspensions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2420.362s">But</a> this resolution stops out-of-school suspensions at the start of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2428.347s">So</a> nothing is immediately happening is my read on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2431.509s">Is</a> that correct, Paul?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2436.833s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2437.788s">So</a> I mean, nobody is suggesting that this happened tomorrow.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3146.789s">So</a> I just wanted to, while we were talking, when I think about accountability, I think about our accountability to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3156.515s">And</a> I think we certainly have a responsibility to follow the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3162.579s">And</a> it's my understanding that those violence issues, particularly that Nadine was talking about, would be cared for under the law and would not <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3175.686s">this</a> would not supersede any requirements that we have under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3178.969s">So,</a> so there is that, but I also think accountability means figuring out how to not repeat the same situations that sort of escalate, particularly amongst students of color, but for any student at that, for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3198.185s">And</a> to make sure that we are doing the things that, that we need to do as a district, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3203.629s">to</a> deescalate those issues and to help those students sort of assess why their behavior is sort of leading to this place and get them on a better path. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3217.656s">But</a> while we were talking, I looked at some other districts and I just wanted to note that Arlington High's out of school suspension rate is 2.1% to our eight <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3233.715s">I'm</a> looking at Malden right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3239.678s">Malden's</a> out of school suspension rate is 7.9% at Malden High to our 8 point something percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3250.664s">And,</a> you know, I just think we have an obligation to try to do better than we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3259.386s">I</a> think we all agree on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3261.167s">And</a> I don't know why there's so much resistance to saying we're gonna make a goal and move towards that goal in a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3269.29s">And</a> frankly, to put the school committee on the hook for the resources and the prioritization of these goals, which is our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3277.934s">So</a> it is our job to decide what those priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3283.177s">Obviously</a> with a lot of input and direction from <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3286.832s">all</a> of the administrators on the phone, which is frankly shocking given that school goes back tomorrow, that you all are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3295.256s">And</a> I wanna point out that it feels like you're all here because you're here to tell us that we're wrong and that out of school suspensions are not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3303.8s">And</a> maybe that's not exactly why you're all here, but I would like to see us all get to a place where we can agree that goals are okay to have, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3313.483s">And</a> that in terms of working to achieve a goal, accountability is critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3322.129s">And</a> that is on both the student and on incumbent on us to set those priorities and to do what we can to mitigate out of school suspensions in total, but also specifically for students who are disproportionately being suspended out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3343.803s">I'll</a> stop there, but I just wanted to point out that it feels like you're all very against this, and I really haven't heard anybody say why.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4332.779s">Graham?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4336.802s">I</a> think that the edits that the superintendent shared, I'm generally fine with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4342.766s">I</a> would. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4343.658s">still</a> ask that a program review be formally added to this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4348.701s">And</a> I would like to see the program review be about discipline in a broader sense than simply out of school suspension, because I think Maria is right that it's, we can't just feel good about solving like this tiny piece of the problem so that our metrics look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4367.29s">Like</a> I want us to be endeavoring to do better <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4373.126s">sort</a> of overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4374.006s">So</a> I think that that program review has to be a little bit more, um, sort of broad in its, um, in its review of discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4383.108s">Um,</a> and I mean, that could include everything like up to and including taking recess away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4390.309s">And</a> we have, uh, we have a resolution that is tabled about recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4394.97s">Um,</a> it continues to be a point of pain at the elementary schools, and maybe it's not like the most immediate thing because we're not going back into a school building tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4403.491s">but</a> it's a form of discipline that begins at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4408.133s">So</a> I would like to still see us add that program review and craft some language that casts like a broader net so that we can address discipline in a comprehensive sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4420.597s">And</a> then I think to Mr. Murphy's point, there should be a number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4425.558s">So</a> we're up to seven now that establishes some sort of reporting <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4430.916s">on</a> an annual basis where we all reflect upon ourselves about, are we making the right progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4438.961s">Are</a> our programs working? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4442.303s">It</a> sounds to me like it has to be a little bit more detailed in some way, and perhaps the program review can recommend what that way is, but I think that data <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4454.171s">is</a> informative to us to say are the programs that we're funding effective, but I think that data also needs to be parsed and provided in a feedback loop to those people issuing the discipline so that they can understand <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4471.115s">What</a> discipline are they delivering and how does that compare to the system overall so that we can help people be aware of their unconscious biases? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4483.478s">Because</a> it's not a criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4485.679s">I</a> mean, it is a criticism and it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4487.499s">We</a> all have those and we all <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4491.869s">need</a> to be willing to look at how those are playing out in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4495.91s">So</a> I think that that reporting mechanism needs to allow our staff to reflect on their own kind of part in this process, and not in a disciplinary way, but in a I think we all want to be better at our jobs kind of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4512.423s">but</a> that reporting should be informative in the macro level program sense, but also in the individual sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4519.39s">And</a> that's when I think data and reporting sort of meet together to provide something really meaningful that can help us move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4527.838s">So</a> those will be my two additions to what the superintendent shared as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5383.933s">So</a> I just, um, I sent these to, uh, to member McLaughlin, but I just wanted to, um, read them out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5392.721s">Um,</a> because as I was typing, I was like riffing a little bit over what I said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5399.087s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure I was clear about what this says. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5402.15s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5403.55s">On</a> the program review, the administration will complete a comprehensive program review of disciplinary practices across the district, including, but not limited to the use of out-of-school suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5412.798s">The</a> program review will recommend mitigation and improvement strategies and will provide specific recommendations on how student victims are supported through our disciplinary practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5423.187s">So</a> that does resonate with me as a woman, as somebody who, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5431.775s">you</a> know, women often are in a position where they are the victim, and there's very little recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5440.257s">And</a> the likelihood of, you know, it sounds like we are lucky that we don't have sexual assaults in our midst. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5449.74s">If</a> that's true, I think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5452.001s">If</a> it's not true, we need to be committed to reporting those as they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5458.482s">But</a> the vast majority of those <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5461.044s">those</a> situations if they occur, that student who assaulted another student, particularly a woman, is going to be right back in class. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5471.708s">So</a> I do want us to be focused in our program review on not just the discipline part of it, but how are we supporting those students who are victims? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5483.973s">Because</a> I do think they're important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5485.654s">And</a> the goal of reducing out-of-school suspensions is not to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5491.798s">ignore</a> the importance of the victims in a particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5496.602s">So</a> I want there to be some focus and some time spent on how we are supporting students who may fall into that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5504.529s">And</a> then the other piece was about the reporting requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5510.27s">The</a> program review will identify annual reporting requirements that include, but is not limited to, system-wide disciplinary measures reporting to the school committee, as well as establishing a staff feedback process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5522.734s">And</a> to Tony's point earlier, most people don't have the luxury of seeing this stuff in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5533.354s">or</a> the misfortune of seeing this stuff in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5535.779s">I</a> don't know what the right qualifier is there, but what I would say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5542.975s">It's</a> not shocking to me that our reporting is totally inadequate on this front. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5548.799s">I</a> think as a district, we lack systemic support for the work that you guys do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5556.525s">And</a> we need to commit to providing you the kind of support that would allow you to be able to describe those things in a consistent way and in a uniform way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5566.432s">so</a> that when people ask about what's happening, there's a way that you can provide that information that doesn't require 25 people on a Zoom sharing anecdotal stories, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5579.463s">But</a> instead that there's some way that the reporting mechanisms you guys use provide you sufficient space and detail to be able to tell us what's happening and to aggregate it <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5594.249s">Because</a> for all kinds of reasons, we're not all like right there in the thick of those situations as they happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5601.623s">But</a> it doesn't mean that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5606.618s">people</a> don't care or that people don't want to know, I just think it simply means that they're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5611.419s">And</a> so the reporting and the systemic support of the work you guys are doing in that moment has to be there and it has to be easy for you all to comply with and be accurate about, otherwise it's not worth doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5625.643s">And</a> I have no idea how you report this stuff, but I continue to get mimeographed pages home <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5633.885s">from</a> 1982, and I'm just here to say that it's probably consistent that we need to do better as a district in giving you guys the systemic support that you need to do what we're asking you to do.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6205.326s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6208.347s">Tomorrow's</a> a big day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6209.167s">We're</a> finally here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6210.487s">So</a> it's very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6211.687s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6212.908s">And</a> I would make a motion to adjourn.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=11359.255s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=11361.696s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12486.162s">I</a> may have more questions than I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12489.868s">suggestions.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12490.549s">But</a> my first question to Ryan was how do you know how much of the original house is intact? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12498.895s">You</a> did mention that there had been maybe some renovations to it over the years, but I'm just wondering if you know how much of the original remains.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12622.828s">Yeah,</a> I was just curious if you were to put a priority on, I mean, is it more about the architectural <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12632.136s">features</a> of the home or the history that it represents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12637.598s">And</a> I don't know, I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, but, you know, so just thinking like in that area, it seems to me a little odd just to, I understand, you know, what you're getting at and what your objectives are, but it seems a little odd to me to just create that as, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12658.942s">a</a> historic district, that single lot where I think we have to look at where we are in present day and balance the tension between historic preservation or educating our residents about our history and allowing important housing and redevelopment to move forward that is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12688.488s">I</a> guess I don't really have any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12690.87s">I'm</a> just sort of thinking out loud, because it is a challenging issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12694.653s">But</a> I sort of like where Clace was going about, is there an option to relocate it to a more appropriate location? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12704.281s">Or</a> is there mitigation somehow that can be negotiated with the homeowner to incorporate some historic elements, maybe not the entire house, but <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12718.41s">information</a> or a plaque or history or photographic evidence of the home are something in writing about the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12731.278s">I</a> don't really have much else to say, but I don't know if I can personally support just blanketly <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12741.802s">recommending</a> that that lot be its own historic district, considering other factors around housing development.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12889.27s">So</a> the- Can I ask another question? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12892.472s">Like</a> one of our first, well, one of the first board meetings that I attended, didn't we have a proposal before us about building, you know, two houses on one lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12906.822s">I</a> mean, has that, and one of them was to allow a second home on a lot where it preserves a historic home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=12913.767s">I</a> mean, is that something that was discussed with this

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=286.973s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=290.455s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=296.754s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=383.204s">Hi,</a> this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=385.064s">I'll</a> make a motion to approve the A&R plan.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=487.468s">Andre,</a> this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=490.71s">I'm</a> not sure if I should do this before you read the notice, but I did want to disclose that I work for Stantec. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=499.175s">And</a> I just learned since the last board meeting that Stantec has been hired by BJ's to provide environmental consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=508.64s">So</a> with that new information, I am going to abstain from reviewing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=515.965s">and</a> participating any further in this review. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=519.446s">So</a> I am going to mute and stop my video for this portion of the agenda.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4312.715s">This</a> is Christy that I just I agree with place I it would be nice to have but <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4320.817s">I</a> don't think it's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4322.097s">I</a> think it does appear from what Mr. Champy explained that it would be pretty challenging and probably impact abutters maybe more significantly than intended to get that done.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6455.099s">Hi,</a> this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6456.28s">I</a> just want to repeat back what I'm hearing as a board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6459.522s">I'm</a> hearing that the present condition of that access is not in an ideal safe state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6471.388s">And</a> it's not the development that's creating that condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6475.13s">But</a> by way of the development, it would improve that condition and maintain access to those houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6482.895s">So</a> is that accurate?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6510.656s">Well,</a> is it enough to say that the development, the only condition is that it maintains access to the
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=11661.944s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=11665.147s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14131.163s">Can</a> I just add, hi, this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14133.905s">So,</a> um, I am in the building profession, but I do agree that the presentation was a little confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14144.103s">And</a> I don't feel like I could make any recommendations to the zoning board at this time, because I don't quite feel like I have a good understanding of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14157.733s">And</a> it would be helpful if the proponent could take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14167.27s">maybe</a> consider the comments from Clace and whatever may come forward tonight and maybe do a repackage of the presentation and walk us through very comprehensively and in a very better way and sequential order of how the development <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14192.624s">works</a> and more renderings and a better explanation of the variances that are being requested.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14204.91s">I</a> think the request is to see all of the information more visually than verbally.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14213.094s">And</a> I would really like to see a response to the Historical Commission's comments, because I believe they are very significant.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14759.941s">I</a> mean, where I'm struggling is I'd like to graphically understand what the problems are, and then take the board members through how <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14770.627s">you're</a> responding to those challenges and presenting the best project possible, considering the conditions of the site and all the parameters that you need to work within.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=14975.379s">The</a> only thing that I would add, if for projects that the board easily understood, I don't know if there's some guidance that the Community Development Board could give and say, here's images that exist online for guidance.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15234.385s">Can</a> I ask, I'm sorry, could I just interrupt for a second and ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15238.828s">This</a> is where I am getting a little more confused in terms of references to the prior project, because do we have to consider the prior project anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15248.295s">That's</a> in the past, and what we're talking about is a project.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15253.458s">So</a> a historical commission's letter is <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15259.118s">Present</a> letter is focused on the current project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15262.401s">So</a> I think that's the subject of our discussion, which is not reference to anything that happened for the prior project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15271.688s">So</a> I think what we're seeing are the comments <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=15275.226s">that</a> we feel are important based on the current project and would like to see a response to those visually.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16442.997s">Christy</a> Dowd, I second.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16456.01s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16458.05s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16501.706s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16513.142s">He'd</a> say bye.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16519.286s">Have</a> a good night.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg/2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg.html">Community Development Board 07-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=206.0s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=211.482s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=1672.123s">I</a> did want to point out that I was just reading the specific requirements for marijuana retailers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=1679.688s">And</a> it does say marijuana retailers shall only be permitted in the C2 and industrial zoning district as specified in the table of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=1691.32s">Marijuana</a> retailers shall not exceed 10,000 square feet in retail floor space That's as specific as it gets for the marijuana retailers, but it doesn't get any more specific on the other Types facilities.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5532.116s">I</a> mean, would it make sense if there's like a <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5538.105s">you</a> know, a floor plan that extends out to, you know, right and left where the other areas may be impacted and you just pick points of perspective views. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5549.071s">So</a> you can see like what the abutting house sees and then, you know, where on the right side, I'm sorry, I'm looking at the mock-up view trying to imagine what's on right and left.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5582.103s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5583.143s">No,</a> I'm just saying.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=11226.937s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=11232.381s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=11234.582s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13511.878s">So</a> I feel generally the same way that Jackie does. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13515.639s">I</a> think we're definitely in a better position by changing the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13521.921s">There's</a> something that still makes me feel a little funny about applying the same requirement to three stories and six stories, because the burden is quite different on a three-story housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13537.646s">That</a> means they're only going to have two floors of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13540.732s">And</a> so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13544.554s">It</a> just seems like it may need a closer look. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13548.377s">So</a> I guess if there was some certainty that there is some flexibility in the review by city council of these future projects going forward to be able to make sure that it's actually feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13566.828s">whatever</a> the commercial use of the ground floor is feasible with the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13574.533s">That's</a> all I would just say. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13576.974s">Because</a> the first floor is not going to be 100% commercial use. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13581.277s">You</a> have to have an entrance and other supporting uses at the ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13585.219s">So</a> I just think that I should proceed with caution just to ensure that there's flexibility there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13731.926s">I</a> agree with the first floor thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13733.287s">I</a> think it's, you know, it's just that the review process, you know, just to make sure that the whole project is feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13741.129s">And</a> anyway, it's something, there was a comment earlier that just got me like, oh, well, we have to make sure that the entire floor is for commercial use, but there has to be some other space that's non-commercial to support the other use of the building.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14418.145s">Well,</a> it seems like maybe one of the flaws, but it says like three stories and not any real square footage metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14432.078s">I</a> believe in the spirit of the zoning amendment, I just think that there's so many more things that are going to come forward that are more complicated as a result of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14447.355s">So,</a> and I just, that's where my concern of flexibility in the review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14453.112s">I</a> mean, usually you say, if we encourage mixed use and if you can get mixed use into your development that's, you know, meets a certain square footage threshold, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14466.146s">And</a> if you do a little more, your incentive is we might give you more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=14472.189s">So</a> like where is incentive-based planning to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15371.211s">Yeah,</a> it seems to make most sense now that we've talked through it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15378.137s">I</a> mean, if we can't make our commercial district successful now, it's a little concerning just blanketly throwing it across apartment one and apartment two. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15391.466s">I</a> don't think there's any question that it belongs in C1 and the mixed use district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15399.532s">But</a> yeah, it seems to make most sense to me.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15637.516s">So</a> I've got a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15639.498s">Something</a> that you said just triggered something. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15640.959s">So,</a> you know, if I own a two or three family and I decide I want to, you know, tear it down and build new, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=15652.862s">am</a> I going to be subject to having to do commercial on the first floor?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16080.458s">I</a> agree with it in spirit, but I feel like there's still a lot of unknowns that could unintentionally burden those areas or not really result in what the mayor is trying to achieve there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16103.596s">So</a> my inclination right now is to say no on those.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16543.267s">So</a> are you saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16545.84s">If</a> someone wants to come in and build a three-story apartment building, they have to go, without commercial uses on the ground floor, they have to go through special permit with this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16558.31s">It's</a> not a right.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16569.187s">Almost</a> makes me think then to give people more density in apartment one if they put commercial use on the ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16578.871s">Give</a> them an extra floor.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16917.683s">Yeah,</a> we could just keep it simple because we don't even know if they're going to write. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=16921.667s">We</a> don't have anything anyway, right?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17000.823s">I'll</a> try this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17003.444s">I</a> make a motion to recommend to the city council that they keep the language as proposed for the zoning amendment to include ground first floor commercial uses in the C1 and mixed use zoning district.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17029.857s">I</a> was crying really hard.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17038.439s">I'll</a> make a motion to recommend on the apartment one and apartment two proposed zoning amendment for our first floor commercial use that we <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17054.188s">We</a> recommend that it be allowed versus required, but there's really not much more that we can offer without further analysis of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17064.975s">So,</a> I mean, is that what we're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17067.377s">Are</a> we just not gonna provide a recommendation on those?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19932.628s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20706.357s">Do</a> we have anything online?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20859.925s">Sorry,</a> I have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20862.267s">My</a> internet went out when you were talking about the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20866.797s">Oh,</a> okay, decided.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20911.892s">I</a> mean, I've typically seen plans for 10 years, but you could mention like, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20917.868s">you</a> know, what would be short, mid long-term goals, but overall you do the plan for 10 years and then plan to revisit it every 10 similar to what Andre was saying.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21112.157s">And</a> then with the 10-year action plan, is the consultant going to advise on how to measure, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21122.647s">key</a> performance indicators and like how the city is like actually achieving those 10 year objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21133.593s">You</a> know, cause then how do you measure yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21135.474s">Cause</a> you know, everybody says like, oh yeah, city always does plans, but then nothing ever happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21142.038s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21164.131s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21164.451s">So</a> to that point, it's like maybe the consultant can advise on how the actions that the city is taking are being measured and reported out for progress.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21688.137s">Nevermind,</a> you know, starting work at, you know, 7am. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21693.52s">We</a> should try that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21694.919s">split</a> up the agenda a little more.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21731.254s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21731.394s">Deanna</a> Peabody?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21754.9s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21755.321s">Take</a> care.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2576.225s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2578.327s">Thanks,</a> Diane. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2579.668s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2580.629s">I</a> am excited that we are offering online registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2586.073s">And</a> I hope that it's our plan to do that regardless of whether our buildings are open or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2590.697s">Because</a> I think there's a tremendous community of parents who getting to the Parent Information Center on a particular day or time is just not logistically feasible when you can do it <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2604.787s">at</a> home. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2605.848s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can find ways to streamline this even further as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2612.013s">But</a> I also wondered now that we have this online registration like have we done pushes out to all the area preschools to sort of make everybody aware that we want them to register as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2630.695s">given,</a> especially given that they may not, you know, if they have a first kindergarten child, they may not be following the blog, or even if they have other children, they may not be following the blog to know that they still need to be doing this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2644.346s">And</a> the sooner, the better.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2662.506s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2662.966s">And</a> then, um, I guess one other question and a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2667.409s">Um,</a> the comment is that before the school closure, we had a subcommittee meeting scheduled to talk about the kindergarten, um, onboarding and registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2676.793s">And</a> I'll circle back with you all on finding another date and time where we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2682.336s">Um,</a> and particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2684.33s">wanting</a> to make sure we get that meeting in before the end of the year so that all the institutional knowledge that Diane has in her head over her years of service can sort of be part of the conversation as we prepare to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2698.759s">And</a> that will obviously, that meeting will continue next year, but I want to make sure we get that in this year for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2704.182s">So</a> I'll reach out on the dates for that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2708.465s">And</a> then I think the other question I had was around, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2714.249s">kindergarten</a> visiting day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2715.55s">And</a> I know, um, especially if you are a first time parent to be able to sort of touch and feel what school is like is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2726.636s">And</a> we may simply not have that option right now, but I was wondering what plan B is if we don't go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2734.48s">And</a> we still want to provide our families some virtual way to touch and feel what school is like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2743.581s">and</a> whether you guys have talked about that at all.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2816.422s">Yeah,</a> I think, you know, none of this is good, but there's a lot of ingenuity that comes out of really, really bad situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2825.126s">So</a> I'm really glad that we were able to move in this direction.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3620.916s">So</a> I think I understand the numbers, but I just want to make sure I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3625.92s">So</a> if you take the McGlynn Elementary School, if we think of the kids that are sort of on watch in some capacity, we have two kids that we haven't made contact with, zero that are closely monitored, zero special ed students not engaged and zero EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3643.072s">So</a> for a total, for that whole school, there are two children <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3647.696s">in</a> a concerned status.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3744.202s">Yeah,</a> and I have to say, I wasn't exactly sure <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3748.43s">what</a> the numbers would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3750.292s">So</a> this is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3754.155s">I</a> think one question I have as we continue to refine these, I'm assuming that you'll give us an updated report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3762.641s">If</a> that can also include like what is the definition of a student that requires close monitoring? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3768.106s">So</a> I'm assuming we're all sort of using that same definition in terms of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3773.628s">what</a> does it mean to be in the category of needing to be closely monitored? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3778.491s">I</a> would just wanna make sure that all of our schools are using the same criteria to come up with that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3786.175s">So</a> hopefully you can add that to the next time that you provide this report to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3791.178s">And</a> then the other question that I had around technology access, access to the internet, and whether there's like a one-to-one device available at home, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3802.383s">is</a> whether there is a place where we're capturing this data from a sustainability perspective in school brains or wherever we capture this kind of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3813.548s">So</a> if we're hearing from a family that they lack internet access, that's something that I think we're going to need to know in a systemic way ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3824.773s">So</a> is there a place that we're capturing that information or is that the next phase of this?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3920.08s">Yeah,</a> and I think having a place for it to live systemically is super important as we think about what the next several months and years looks like throughout the sort of ebb and flow of this virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3935.944s">I</a> don't think there's going to be less need for us to be really clear about how many students lack internet access, how many students lack a device, those kinds of things as we go forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5329.992s">I</a> have been thinking a lot about the same thing when it comes to what happens in the future and the need for contingency planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5341.639s">And</a> I'd like to make a motion that the engagement communications and strategic planning subcommittee work with the administration to develop plan to have a series of community roundtables in the month of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5356.905s">The</a> plan would include a strategy to use the roundtables to develop possible fall 2020 back to school scenarios amidst our ever-changing environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5367.714s">The</a> subcommittee would provide a full plan to the school committee at our next meeting on May 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5372.958s">And</a> the roundtables sort of in my vision would be something that would be executed as committee of the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5380.184s">But</a> I want to totally appreciate all the hard work the administration has done <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5388.079s">so</a> far, and I'm very concerned about the administration continuing to sort of take on the load of all of this on their own, especially as we look forward to fall 2020 and what that could mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5403.082s">And</a> it could mean we're all back to school and we're just behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5405.683s">It</a> could mean something else completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5407.824s">I</a> think there's a bunch of scenarios there that we need to sort of vet out in collaboration between the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5415.281s">our</a> teachers and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5418.203s">So</a> I'd like to make that motion and hopefully have a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=5422.446s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6328.317s">It</a> was a lot to digest, but I got through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6332.079s">I</a> did have one question though. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6333.299s">At</a> the beginning of the report, it says there's 226 total responses, 102 complete responses, 61 partial responses, and 63 disqualified responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6344.484s">And</a> I wondered if you could just clarify what a partial response means and what a disqualified response means.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6419.002s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6419.622s">Thank</a> you, and I think the other question that I had, I think I saw that you could answer the survey multiple times if you had multiple children. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6430.05s">Do</a> you have any sense of how many folks responded more than one time, or is the data not able to tell you that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8019.614s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8021.196s">Just</a> a quick comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8022.097s">This</a> was another meeting that sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8025.453s">got</a> held hostage to our school closure back in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8030.276s">So</a> there were several meetings that need to be rescheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8032.777s">And</a> this meeting to refer this to the engagement and communications and strategic planning subcommittee is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8040.281s">And</a> I will get something on the books shortly so that we can be prepared to look at the results once they come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8050.266s">So</a> we'll find a time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8052.916s">Great,</a> thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2020-04-14_a7nti5izX0Y/2020-04-14_a7nti5izX0Y.html">Medford School Committee Budget Meeting April 6, 2020</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=790.513s">Just</a> a quick question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=791.534s">For</a> the marching band, do students pay participation fees to be part of the marching band?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=822.865s">And</a> do you have a sense of the average amount of fundraising that happens year over year to support the band?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=870.729s">And</a> does the band parent organization, did they submit information to the district about their fundraising dollars this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=881.869s">Is</a> there some way to know what that amount of money is?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=900.991s">Yeah,</a> whenever you have a chance, it's not urgent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=902.612s">I</a> just, I'm just trying to sort of understand how all of the extracurriculars come together, which is different from, you know, between fine arts and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=913.818s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1704.6s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1704.88s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1706.876s">Thanks,</a> Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1708.318s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1709.139s">When</a> we talked about the middle school health curriculum, we noted the need for a staff person, but we also had some notes about professional development and materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1720.691s">Is</a> that included in these numbers that we're looking at on screen or are those additional costs too?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1737.395s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2757.126s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2758.827s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2760.308s">Yes,</a> Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2761.949s">Thanks,</a> Molly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2763.57s">Can</a> you tell me, the screen that we're looking at now, which one of those line items is the replacement budget?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2813.276s">So</a> the $175 would equal the labs at Columbus Brooks and Medford High for $75. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2820.261s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2821.301s">Plus,</a> what is the other $100?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2847.657s">But</a> it doesn't include the 136 on the second line of the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2852.68s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2853.24s">So</a> if you see right, it says NPS technology refresh plan up under plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2864.713s">And</a> so that number says 136. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2866.575s">So</a> this, that hundred is not the same as this 136.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2872.099s">Um,</a> and then when you talk about, uh, things like, uh, maker spaces and building learning capacity, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2884.15s">cybersecurity</a> training. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2885.591s">There's</a> no cost associated with any of those things on your plan.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2940.398s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2941.718s">And</a> then, as I, as we scroll down your plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2948.38s">There's</a> this, there's this mention of, I guess it's in the <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2952.412s">down</a> to the wish list about the 1,200 machines, the 2012 desktops, the 1,200 machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2960.234s">Are</a> these numbers in the budget somewhere? <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2962.795s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2965.955s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2967.856s">Can</a> the machines even be used anymore?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3085.05s">Okay,</a> and then when you talk about increased library staff, is there like an average amount of salary that a licensed librarian or credentialed librarian we would expect to pay?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3197.609s">And</a> Kirsten, in your opinion, if we were to have a line item that dealt with routine maintenance so that we don't find ourselves in a position where we're having to <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3209.725s">bond</a> and spend millions of dollars in one shot, like what would that number be from your perspective that would keep us maintained?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3641.684s">I</a> mean, we had this conversation at length and I was personally told that there is no such thing as a number that we work to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3650.992s">Lots</a> of looks like, I don't know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3653.374s">And</a> yet here we are, we're talking about a number that we're working toward and we don't even know what that number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=3658.778s">No</a> one has ever told us there's a 5% number we're working toward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4416.663s">Um,</a> next we have athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4420.144s">Oh,</a> can, can I ask a question real quick? <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4421.765s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4423.185s">Um,</a> for the two nursing positions that you're looking for, Tony, what is the sort of, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4433.008s">starting</a> point for salary for a position like that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4692.657s">In</a> our first budget meeting where we talked about the budget process and the notion that we weren't building to a number, we also had a motion on the table to schedule budget hearings for community schools specifically, as well as the before and after school and food service. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4710.676s">So</a> those big revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4713.274s">And</a> to my knowledge, those haven't been scheduled yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4716.616s">Do</a> we have a plan to get those on the calendar sooner rather than later? <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4720.157s">And</a> then my second scheduling question for Bobby is, we did have a motion to talk about the policies and procedures around athletics eligibility, and that was supposed to be end of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4732.723s">But</a> obviously, we're all just a little delayed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4736.185s">So</a> I was just curious when we could expect that information as we go forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4836.73s">Well,</a> I think it may have been my motion and that was definitely my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4841.414s">So,</a> I understand that they are not budget built in this same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4846.118s">However,</a> we have no <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4848.43s">We</a> have no visibility or transparency into how those revolving accounts work, like community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4855.177s">I</a> know there's a million things that come in and out of community schools, and we don't ever talk about those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4860.341s">So</a> my intention when we were having that discussion, and I don't know how other people feel about this, but my intention was that we would have a financial review of those revolving accounts that was <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4872.733s">in</a> more detail than a single line item on a single piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=4877.754s">So</a> I'd like to, if that was unclear the first time, I'm happy to make a motion right now to conduct a financial review of our evolving account programs in some level of detail so that we can all understand the ins and outs of those programs.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5348.44s">Okay,</a> I know we're at 530. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5351.742s">I</a> still have a motion on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5353.142s">Okay,</a> can you just repeat your motion, it was to conduct a financial review of revolving our revolving our significant revolving accounts so food service before and after schools and community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5365.769s">I'm,</a> I'm super willing, I'm super willing to talk about a reasonable timeline but <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5372.472s">I</a> don't know how we ever have a reasonable timeline because every time we talk about the budget, we run out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5377.814s">So</a> something has to change in this process going forward, for sure, so that we can have time to talk about all of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5385.577s">But</a> we can't continue to say we don't have time when this committee is expected to sign off on a budget and send it to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5398.562s">whether</a> it's this budget or it's revolving accounts, it's all related. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5402.103s">None</a> of it can be isolated, not the way we currently do business.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5588.241s">I'm</a> talking specifically about these revolving account meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5592.044s">They</a> can wait to occur until next year, but they need to occur before October 15th.<h2><a href="../2020-04-14_cdDdeNL9hko/2020-04-14_cdDdeNL9hko.html">Medford School Committee virtual meeting April 6, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3124.365s">You're</a> on mute, Brianna.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3754.922s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3756.944s">Kirsten,</a> can you just give us an update on the timeline of the larger negotiation that you're referring to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3821.508s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry, I was talking about our upcoming contract that's out to bid.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3846.317s">And</a> I think we talked about sharing a copy with the committee in one of our initial budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3853.441s">If</a> you could send a copy of the bid or give us a link or something, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3859.403s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3860.744s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4386.368s">So</a> mayor, this was approved in our, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4390.538s">meeting</a> whenever that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4395.301s">But</a> we do need to change the date to give Peter some runway to get this off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4401.445s">Peter,</a> I was thinking May 4th, but you tell me if that's okay, thumbs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4408.99s">So</a> I'd make a motion to amend this approved motion to change the timeline to our May 4th school meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4420.14s">school</a> committee meeting.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4817.199s">I</a> think all of this certainly speaks to starting at the beginning of the process instead of at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4825.405s">I</a> think if we sit down and we talk about a clear set of goals, we can mitigate against differing opinions about what the committee is supposed to do or wants to do or thinks they should do or thinks they can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4838.715s">We</a> also would have an opportunity then to outline and lay out <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4842.558s">what</a> the real expectations are for the kind of work that we're doing, how much time we think it's going to take, as well as what's the right number of people on the committee to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4854.224s">So</a> because we never outline what the work is, we have no idea if we have the right number of people to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4861.027s">I</a> think there's a lot of different schools of thoughts that we need to entertain as we put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4865.189s">So</a> if we start there with the beginning of the process, we can have a clear picture of the number and types of folks that we want to represent our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4875.752s">Then</a> we can put out a call that is clear and unambiguous, solicit people, bring them back and allow this committee to <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4886.1s">help</a> put that committee together so that it can be positioned to move forward as quickly as possible, given our already delay.<h2><a href="../2020-04-02_h6VaG8W1tBc/2020-04-02_h6VaG8W1tBc.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 30, 2020</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=1498.32s">Thank</a> you, Marianne.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3718.404s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7221.845s">Hi,</a> a couple of questions for Bernadette, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7228.388s">I</a> know we've done one deployment of Chromebooks already, and it sounds like we gave out like 400 or so Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7236.171s">I</a> know that there are families out there who felt like it's only going to be a couple of weeks at this point, and I'm sort of making do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7245.517s">But</a> with a longer projected outlook of all of this through at least May 4th, but in reality could well be past that, do we have a guidance for families who may not yet have computers that would be helpful to share? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7263.984s">And</a> also, do we have enough Chromebooks? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7267.785s">And</a> if we don't, are there <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7271.343s">funds</a> coming from the state level or elsewhere to support the purchase of additional equipment to support our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7281.95s">I</a> can even speak in my own house. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7283.932s">We</a> have a computer, but juggling that between multiple kids, my work computer is not an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7293.318s">My</a> husband's work computer is not an option, but at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7297.709s">I</a> know that we're not alone and I've only got two children. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7300.31s">So</a> I'm sure there's lots of people out there juggling even further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7304.291s">So</a> can you share some guidance and whether there's been any discussion about additional equipment purchases at the city level or even the state level?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7395.925s">And</a> has there been any discussion about the city or the state providing additional equipment should we need it?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7452.604s">Yeah,</a> I think the important point, though, is we're well off the mark of being a one-to-one Chromebook district. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7458.605s">So</a> I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7461.355s">I</a> would not be surprised at all if we run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7463.756s">We're</a> nowhere near a one-to-one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7465.577s">So</a> as we move forward into prolonged at-home instruction, I think we just, you know, it's more note to, you know, the city and the state level that this is where I sort of expect we're gonna get to a problem here in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7488.588s">I</a> have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7492.014s">I'm</a> glad that we've clarified the Zoom component. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7497.778s">As</a> we go forward with this plan, which by the way, I know was just a tremendous amount of work to put together and start moving everybody down this sort of course corrected path, which is, it feels like what we're all doing every day, almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7513.951s">Will</a> there be another iteration of coordination across the district so that our teachers are planning across <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7522.395s">not</a> just what's happening in their own building with their grade, but what's happening across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7527.056s">And</a> I just am super sensitive to the fact that a teacher may have had a really great curriculum plan, lesson plan, and it's all been tossed up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7537.918s">And</a> now they're saying, how do I give at-home instruction for three hours a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7542.698s">How</a> do I do that in a way that doesn't necessarily rely on the computer? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7545.839s">When</a> do I use the computer? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7547.499s">Like</a> we're totally sort of starting from scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7551.957s">And</a> I am just wondering if there's work that will start to happen across, say like our third grade team, so that our third grade team across the entire city is collaborating and sharing what's been working, what hasn't worked, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7567.023s">So</a> that at the end of all of this, our third graders sort of emerge similarly, if that's even possible at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7578.421s">Will</a> that start to happen next or what is the plan as we sort of look forward to how do we on ramp to normal school sometime in the future?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7751.119s">Yeah,</a> and I Bernadette, I totally appreciate that we can't do everything all at once at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7759.006s">And</a> that this plan is going to have to live and breathe and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7762.029s">So</a> as we sort of press forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7766.133s">I'm</a> sensitive to the fact that our teachers are in uncharted waters as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7775.341s">And</a> they have kids at home and <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7777.68s">reinventing</a> the wheel for three hours of instruction every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7782.862s">However</a> we can help them make that process easier in the next iteration as this thing evolves, I think would be wonderful for everyone.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10155.147s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10157.549s">Can</a> we, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10160.1s">Can</a> you hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10161.101s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10161.661s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10162.562s">Um,</a> I was noticing in the the report and the conversation around having not been able to reach 30 out of 480 students felt like a good sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10176.198s">way</a> to understand what's happening in terms of how many students are we reaching and I'd like for us as we talk about the entire school population at all levels for us to figure out how we can start to assess where we're at <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10191.968s">in</a> all buildings and with all of our populations in a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10195.47s">And</a> it doesn't have to be on Monday, but as we continue to progress forward, I would hope that we're reaching more and more and more families. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10204.334s">And</a> if that's not happening, I want us to be thinking about whether we need to be changing our strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10210.256s">So</a> can we put that on an agenda for a future meeting?<h2><a href="../2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk/2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 9, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4917.096s">I'm</a> just I'm like just to like give a little bit of a clarification on to like or insight into like thank you so we should cancel for a week member Graham it's like being a senior and wanting a snow day I suppose but so I have a couple of questions the first one actually really sort of dovetails nicely do we even know <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4943.428s">what</a> our families do and don't have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4947.23s">Like,</a> I think we speculate quite a bit about what they do and don't have access to, but I don't think we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4953.794s">And</a> maybe there's a way to start to know so that we have some indication of what our reality really, really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4965.52s">So</a> we may find that people have more access than we think. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4969.342s">We</a> may not find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4971.678s">But</a> I think it's important to understand what does access mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4975.879s">Do</a> they have a Chromebook or a laptop at home? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4978.54s">Do</a> they have internet at home? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4980.261s">Do</a> they have a smartphone? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4981.921s">What</a> are those access components that could become important as we go forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4988.663s">And</a> then I think the other thing from an emergency preparedness perspective is, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4993.188s">We</a> have never deployed Chromebooks for individual use to my knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4997.974s">So</a> I'm going to assume that we don't have a deployment plan to sort of manage equipment like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5005.042s">So</a> that's a whole other sort of work effort to think about technology deployment that we should be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5015.046s">I</a> was also curious whether the food security task force, I know it's forming, but if they're involved in your upcoming meetings to talk about the students who do rely on us for food and what deployment options there would be where we have to call off school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5031.409s">And</a> then finally I saw an update from the commissioner of DESE today about guidance around makeup days that came through my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5040.151s">So</a> there is some guidance out there that talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5043.325s">The</a> 180 days is still in play officially right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5048.229s">There</a> were some different levers in terms of if the day is after a certain time, then it sort of changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5055.094s">And</a> I just saw that today, but I would definitely sort of caution against us thinking blizzard bags are the option, because I don't think they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5067.283s">I</a> don't think that <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5069.221s">I'm</a> necessarily equipped to teach my Children the way that the educators in this community are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5075.069s">So</a> I know that doesn't, you know, sort of make it easy to deal with something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5080.156s">But</a> I think we have to carefully weigh those pros and cons of <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5083.68s">you</a> know, just tossing homework at people and expecting that that can pass for learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5089.463s">Is</a> it just to make sure that people stay sharp? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5092.185s">Is</a> it just in cases where we're asking somebody to self quarantine? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5097.207s">Like</a> what are all of those remote learning components? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5100.729s">And</a> when, as you build your plan, I'm just hoping that you guys will sort of think through all of those things and then tell the community what you're thinking about those things so that people have an understanding of, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5112.409s">The</a> fact that we are thinking about this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5114.67s">We</a> do have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5116.771s">Here's</a> what's not perfect about our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5119.011s">And</a> what have you just so that people understand? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5122.113s">I</a> mean, the situation seems like it changes every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5126.114s">Maybe</a> more frequently than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5128.315s">So</a> it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5129.395s">I</a> know it's a moving target and I appreciate all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5132.536s">I</a> would just want to make sure that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5134.955s">have</a> these other components of the plan flushed in so that we are really ready if we have to mobilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5141.799s">And</a> it goes far beyond cleaning buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5143.92s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5144.561s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5144.921s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7113.237s">So</a> I just had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7114.598s">On</a> the airfare topic, it's more complicated than just how you might buy a regular flight, because if you bought a regular flight on Delta, there's a $200 change fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7124.084s">You</a> can personally use that ticket going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7127.146s">But</a> a lot of these tour companies go through a consolidation process, and it radically changes what your ticketed options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7136.632s">It</a> could be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7137.452s">It</a> could be bad for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7139.414s">There's</a> some digging under the covers that needs to happen with the tour operator to understand what those implications are because they may well be quite different than what the commercial airlines are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7150.742s">Right</a> now what they're saying is if you buy a ticket right now, they'll be super flexible with you going forward because they want to take your money right now and not have sales come to a crashing halt. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7163.01s">But</a> they aren't allowing people to cancel <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7166.556s">trips</a> right now and receive refunds on stuff that has been booked in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7170.457s">So</a> there's a lot of nuance in that flight stuff that we would probably need to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7177.199s">I</a> found this policy incredibly confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7181.12s">I</a> had to work really hard to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7184.201s">So</a> I would like for us also as a committee to revisit our field trip policy and talk about the kinds of information that has to go home to families so that everyone is really, really clear what the insurance means. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7196.769s">For</a> example, the report says that this insurance is required, and on the form it says that cancel for any reason is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7204.895s">So</a> is it an option, or is it required? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7208.078s">I</a> understand that forms may be different, but I just want to make sure that the information that we're sending home to families proactively is clear, and it's clear that it's not clear, because there were questions tonight about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7221.36s">But</a> I also, I do support the notion that we need to talk to the Attorney Greenspan and understand what those options are and really think about the best course of action for our families, who this is a lot of money to lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7241.325s">And</a> a lot, you know, there's huge benefits to going through tour companies, but this is sort of one of the downfalls of going through tour companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7248.427s">Like</a> if you just booked a hotel, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7250.854s">Many,</a> many times you can get out of it, especially this far in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7254.457s">But</a> once you're inside a tour company's package, it's very, very hard to decouple. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7258.62s">So</a> I think we really need to have a lot of conversation with the tour company. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7262.944s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that we give the superintendent the authority to make this decision before the 31-day timeline, but only after she has a conversation with our attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7276.556s">He</a> has ample time to get in touch with the travel company and explore how we recover more money for our families than just simply $1,000.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7899.367s">I</a> would like to make a motion that we send our field trip protocols back to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7911.05s">I</a> totally hear your point about we all weren't looking at this fine print and there is <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7916.198s">a</a> big difference between having insurance and having good insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7919.579s">And</a> I feel like we're sort of caught in that trap right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7923.58s">I'm</a> not an insurance expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7925.74s">You're</a> not an insurance expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7928.241s">But</a> I think we have to do something to make sure we have the right guardrails in place so that an actual insurance expert can help us weigh the pros and cons, or frankly, make decisions to self-insure in these cases, which is another insurance option. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7943.544s">You</a> know, more complicated, it's a different thing altogether, but I think we really have to sort of investigate all of those options. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7950.186s">So</a> I'd like to send this to the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee so that they can take a look at it and come up with some solutions to be productive about this going forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8373.607s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8375.347s">I</a> think it's also important to note that our charter school bill will increase by about a half a million dollars next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8381.609s">So</a> $138,000 isn't going to go really very far in the big scheme of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8389.45s">I</a> didn't know Mayor Lungo-Koehn what information you've received from our state delegation because one of the central things that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8397.082s">does</a> stand to impact Medford is one of the final measures, which was funded at only 4% of the seven year phase in instead of 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8406.913s">So</a> every other measure was funded at 14%, which includes special education, English language learners and health care costs, but support for support for <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8420.164s">High</a> needs students was only funded in the governor's budget at 4% in year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8427.228s">So</a> it's a drastic shift down from how the rest of the equation is funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8433.291s">I'm</a> sure it's why towns like Winchester stand to make more money than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8438.274s">In</a> all of this But I would like to know from the state delegation what they're doing to Affect change in the Ways and Means Committee process as they put their budgets together and how we can help and then Finally I make a motion that this report be sent to the <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8465.133s">engagement,</a> communication, and strategic planning subcommittee for further work in support of the submission, and as importantly, the requirements around having a plan for engaging families across the district, which is critically important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9026.626s">I</a> agree that there's not enough time for any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9030.95s">But</a> one thing I do want to mention is that one of the central questions were asked in this plan is <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9038.951s">What</a> is our plan for ongoing engagement? <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9042.133s">And</a> I don't believe we have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9044.595s">And</a> that is someplace we could start. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9046.116s">So</a> what we could do between now and April 1st is draft a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9052.721s">It</a> does go on to say that they are specifically wanting us to engage organizations that represent some of our marginalized families, our PTOs, our CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9068.542s">our</a> English language learners pack, title one, so there are teachers, so there are some specific people that I think we could reach out to between now and April 1st to start to have the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9082.177s">And</a> if we've started to have the conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9085.023s">Surely</a> we can write a paragraph that talks about what our ongoing plan is with the notion across this room that it is just the starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9094.508s">But</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9095.969s">We</a> cannot meaningfully engage people we've never successfully engaged before in 10 days or even in 20 days to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9105.073s">This</a> isn't a March problem or even a January to March problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9110.496s">What</a> we can do though I think is to move it to the subcommittee and talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9115.069s">what</a> those plans might be, start that brainstorming and get this thing submitted and behind us so we can get back to doing the real work of family engagement without money to do family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9125.194s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9663.817s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9665.859s">So</a> one of the things that I'm thinking about in terms of the timeline, I know it's tight, but we have a really short window of time and opportunity to mobilize, particularly on the Brooks and Columbus play spaces so that those can be ready to be acted on this summer when kids are out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9689.477s">And</a> I also think we have an equally short timeline on the <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9694.102s">RFP</a> to engage the proper partner to do the McGlynn design study because that study needs to <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9705.799s">Be</a> sent out to RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9707.3s">We</a> need to select a bidder. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9708.82s">That</a> bidder needs to be engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9711.121s">They</a> need to do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9712.922s">And</a> then we need to have our eye on the timeline that by November of this coming year, if we are going to be preparing to go back to the CPC, we'll need to be ready with information. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9724.848s">I</a> know there was a lot of talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9727.389s">We</a> had a meeting a couple of weeks ago, a number of us and a number of other interested parties who want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9735.312s">this</a> committee engages the right design firm, particularly for the McGlynn Playground that knows how to engage the community, how to engage with kids, how to engage with students of all abilities, and how to really sort of balance all the various needs across our student populations and really our community population to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9757.767s">So</a> I think there's interested folks across the committee, across the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9763.442s">But</a> I don't think this committee has to be particularly small. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9767.784s">I</a> just think they have a lot of work to do to shepherd this through its process and make sure that along that process the right people are engaged for their input where it is particularly valuable rather than what I don't want to do is bog down folks who want to be part of <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9790.271s">the</a> conversation in feeling like they have to sign on to review and write RFPs in order to be involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9798.093s">So</a> the committee is really there to do that work to make sure that folks are appropriately engaged along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9805.655s">And</a> in the interest of time, I'm suggesting that Peter, who has been front and central on all the CPC grants, sort of act to collect applications, vet them, and provide a recommendation to us.<h2><a href="../2020-02-28_Mn4KS2yu_8U/2020-02-28_Mn4KS2yu_8U.html">Medford School Committee meeting February 24, 2020</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=493.051s">Am</a> I good? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=493.451s">Am</a> I on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=494.412s">I</a> also wanted to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=496.353s">This</a> year in particular, I know it was a real team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=501.016s">We</a> called in reinforcements from all over the place to make this race happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=505.378s">And</a> there were lots of folks who jumped in, some of whom don't even have children in our schools, like Lauren Felch and a number of other folks who really, really stepped forward to make this happen and really bolster the team this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=519.466s">So</a> I just wanted to say a special thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=521.875s">all</a> the people who made this year's race in particular happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=524.917s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3782.56s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3783.181s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3785.502s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for the work that you've been doing to pilot FOSS in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3791.525s">I</a> had the opportunity to sit in on some of the early conversations when teachers were looking at various curricula and I just really commend the process and the engagement from teachers across the entire district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3806.753s">So</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3807.837s">that</a> that has served us well, because what I hear come back from my kids is real excitement about science, and I sort of wish I got to learn science that way, because as it stands, I'm not allowed to teach science in my home, because I'm unqualified, so I might drop in for a science class or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3828.154s">And</a> then one question that I had on the budget was, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3833.618s">I</a> was surprised to see that the consumables cost was so low, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3837.66s">To</a> be bringing in living organisms and all kinds of other things, that's not a lot of money across such a big swath of classrooms.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3906.785s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3907.486s">And</a> then the other just point of context for the people in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3912.754s">We</a> sort of made reference to a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3916.4s">All</a> of the departments have been asked to identify three to five initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3921.335s">that</a> if funded would positively impact student achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3925.178s">So</a> that's a mouthful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3926.439s">So</a> it's sort of been abbreviated to wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3929.642s">And</a> so all of the departments are providing the school committee really for the first time an articulation of what those things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3935.567s">So</a> thank you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3938.029s">And</a> it's super nice to be able to grant $0 wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3941.012s">So</a> thank you for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3943.774s">That</a> was the best wish so far.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4678.628s">Yep,</a> member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4681.429s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4683.749s">At</a> the middle school level, do you have any data that tells us what demand would look like if there was another language offering? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4694.432s">So</a> I don't know how the selection process happens today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4701.814s">If</a> one language is more popular than the other, if you introduce French, how would that change the dynamics of <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4708.675s">students</a> and sort of what their preferences are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4710.656s">And</a> I don't know if you have that information or there's a way you can sort of start to collect it to understand demand.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4795.482s">»»</a> So is there an opportunity to do some data collection since this form is going to go out and families are going to be responding in real time to understand, would there be a preference there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4808.992s">if</a> it was offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4809.793s">I</a> mean, obviously we'd have to say it's not offered currently, but we're trying to understand what the demand would be if there was three choices.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4846.717s">And</a> I guess the other question that I would have is, do you have data that you could share with us about historical demand? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4855.981s">So</a> how often? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4857.992s">does</a> somebody get their first choice? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4859.253s">How</a> often does somebody not get their first choice and gets placed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4863.417s">Because</a> I feel like once you start on a trajectory with language, you're in a shoot and you're continuing down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4871.503s">It's</a> a little bit harder to change course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4873.005s">So</a> I'm just curious if we have the right number of the right things based on what we see the demand is.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6251.158s">Does</a> the Andrew 7th grade class go on this same field trip or is it just a McGlynn trip?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6288.556s">Yeah,</a> I am a huge advocate of field trips and the experiences that they afford our students, some of whom may not have similar experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6301.032s">just</a> sort of in their general path as they kind of travel through seventh grade as an individual or eighth grade or any other grade for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6310.094s">So</a> definitely exploring particularly now that we've moved to a full lottery and we're embracing that model where we're saying our middle school experiences are really the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6320.195s">I</a> think it would be really great for us to think about these kinds of experiences as places where we want to be able to offer similar experiences between the two schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6340.359s">Yeah,</a> it's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6341.28s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6342.7s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6343.041s">Member</a> Ruseau.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9008.046s">Thank</a> you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9009.968s">So</a> a couple of things that strike me as I listened to the report and read it and it was actually helpful for you guys to say the same things again because there is a lot to digest here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9022.996s">A</a> couple of things that just sort of jumped out at me, and that parents have asked me about personally.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9051.899s">expecting</a> more timely connection of my child was assessed and you saw X or Y or Z and then I found out about it versus if you found out something about my child in October, I wouldn't want to have to wait until February to know that there was something amiss there.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9191.529s">Yeah,</a> I guess when I think about the sequencing, right, like I know we're kind of obligated to a timeline for conferences by teacher contract, but that timeline doesn't match up with any step in the assessment process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9206.017s">So</a> it doesn't match up with the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9208.478s">So</a> I can understand wanting ideally to have a face-to-face conversation, but now we've had kindergarten conferences and we're gonna finish that second assessment <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9220.112s">So</a> we've missed it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9221.453s">So</a> what's that?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9235.36s">But</a> if the second assessment isn't due to be finished until this Friday, have you had the kindergarten?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9307.768s">So</a> is there a timeline for that, for when the results from February will go home to families?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9343.738s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9344.739s">And</a> then just hearing this update and hearing about pre-budget, it sort of strikes me that there's like a bigger picture here, particularly as it relates to the budget, which is not just about what tool we use to screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9362.172s">I</a> think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9363.995s">when</a> you start screening, I think we probably expect to see a lot more children be identified earlier that may require services, which also potentially costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9377.339s">Um,</a> and then from there, um, we have our, you know, sort of the curriculum conversation that has started around ECRI and journeys and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9387.123s">But</a> then we also have this whole pile of kids, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9391.298s">who</a> are like out of the cycle of an initial assessment being able to catch those challenges early and remediate them, and they may be in six, seven, eight, nine, 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9403.303s">So</a> what is our plan to sort of identify those children and do what we need to do to remediate them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9410.746s">So</a> it just strikes me that there's this bigger conversation around literacy and the costs we need to anticipate both <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9420.098s">this</a> year and into the future that we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9424.321s">I'm</a> told by lots of people that there's lots of support all over the city, including at our city council for support of the money that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9431.807s">And</a> that is super exciting to me, but I feel like we do have to lay that out somehow so that we can start to have a meaningful conversation around what it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9441.913s">What</a> are all the, like, if there's 100 parts, which parts of the 100 parts are we dealing with this year, and where do we go from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9448.875s">So</a> how do we, when do you sort of plan to tell us what the data's telling us, and when do we have that conversation, I guess is my question.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9703.336s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9703.656s">And</a> I think the other, when I think of the big literacy picture, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9708.618s">It</a> also includes what's happening with our tier three students who are not in your budget, but they're in the special ed budget, but they're sort of all wrapped up in this conversation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9719.702s">In</a> some way, shape, or form, because we're talking about literacy and we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9723.547s">what</a> tools are we using to remediate and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9726.368s">So</a> when I think about like that need for that bigger picture, that's a whole other facet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9731.409s">I</a> would include in my mind that has to be included if we're talking about literacy, whether it's, you know, whoever's budgeted ends up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9738.671s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9739.031s">So</a> I feel like we need to have that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9740.812s">I</a> don't know where we would have that conversation, but I think it's really important.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9770.786s">And</a> I think just like sort of any process when this happens, these bubble years are going to be years where we're having to <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9779.302s">do</a> many things, and if we can see to the other side of it, things get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9784.664s">But</a> for right now, we do have a lot ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9787.526s">So</a> again, I'm not exactly sure if that's a curriculum subcommittee conversation to have, which is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9795.129s">But</a> I really want us to have that sort of broader literacy conversation so that when we're making decisions about the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=9803.493s">we</a> sort of can do that with that whole picture in mind.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10786.298s">So</a> I know I sent a note to you before I resigned as the chair of the Brooks PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10792.24s">I</a> tried to submit and I got an error message and that was after I put all the information in the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10798.782s">So</a> I don't know if it landed to you and it just threw an error or if it just <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10804.92s">evaporated.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10807.625s">Okay,</a> so then maybe it was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10809.329s">I</a> just wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10810.872s">The</a> other thing I want to point out about that policy is that there were commitments made by the district about <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10817.752s">some</a> training support that would be offered to these organizations, and that has not happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10826.315s">There</a> was something shared that was a webinar from the AG's office, which was actually really informative if you're going to be on a board that is a 501c3. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10839.699s">And</a> I know some schools have taken measures to make sure their folks are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10844.115s">But</a> one of the big important pieces that sort of gave rise to needing a policy at all was around treasury and record keeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10852.058s">And</a> there was a commitment in that policy that the district would be providing some training resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10857.576s">for</a> our treasurer specifically and I know that that hasn't happened yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10932.563s">Yeah,</a> and I can certainly appreciate the <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10937.151s">Time</a> constraint, I think it's real and I think we have to figure out a way to maybe collaborate our way out of that But I will say As a 501 c3 the job of a treasurer is very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10951.88s">It</a> has a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10954.113s">obligations</a> and ramifications that sort of well-intentioned parents trying to do good for their schools just may not have the depth to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10963.239s">Like</a> literally my eyebrows go up each and every time I hear about a raffle going on in our school district because I suspect that many of them are not compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10975.086s">And</a> it's not because people don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10977.548s">It's</a> that they don't even know that there's something to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10981.456s">So</a> I think there are some key things that are really important from a compliance standpoint that if we could all maybe work together with the PTOs that are doing this and experiencing it and building something that's repeatable, whether that's like a Webex or something that's recorded, it would go a long way to the collaboration and a feeling that the sort of support goes both ways from the district to the PTOs and vice versa.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11429.263s">Patterson</a> when they have problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11432.585s">I</a> think that's the worst case scenario, actually, because she's going to end up repeating herself again and again as people ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11440.208s">So</a> we can remove it from the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11444.63s">That's</a> an option that we should maybe talk about in the Rules Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11451.405s">But</a> I just want this body to know that despite the best of intentions of all of these really hardworking volunteers, they're probably not getting it right because it's very complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11465.217s">And</a> I don't want that to come back and sort of cause stress on this body or this administration, but more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11475.257s">I</a> don't want it to come back on these well-meaning volunteers, which could also happen as they sit on a board of a 501c3. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11483.56s">So</a> I know it's sort of not our problem to solve, but from a collaboration standpoint, I have some real concerns about choosing not to do anything, because I feel like we need to take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11502.207s">Member</a> Ruseau.<h2><a href="../2020-02-06_4OupiMzprjU/2020-02-06_4OupiMzprjU.html">Medford School Committee February 3, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=945.138s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1869.243s">I</a> mostly echo what Paulette had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1871.785s">And</a> I think one of the hardest things about advocacy is it takes a lot of personal conviction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1879.268s">And</a> I think you guys all quite clearly have that level of personal conviction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1884.391s">So</a> regardless of what anybody says to you or what the answer is, I think the cornerstone of advocacy is that if you believe in what you're advocating for, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1896.528s">Don't</a> let anybody tell you differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1898.35s">So</a> please keep doing what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1901.293s">We've</a> clearly taught you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1903.336s">And</a> I would also say that there's lots of ways to feel regret and to feel like you're getting messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1912.646s">And</a> some of those feelings can come from unspoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1917.935s">comments</a> or unspoken body language, and others can come from actual direct communication that has made you feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1927.882s">And</a> what I would encourage you all to do is that if there are things being directly spoken to you that make you feel like you are being penalized, I would ask you to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1940.071s">coming</a> forward to either Superintendent Edouard-Vincent or Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, and to make sure that they understand where that's coming from so that if there is a systemic issue, we can address it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2715.435s">»»</a> Can I just ask one more question before you leave the microphone? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2719.518s">Maybe</a> two? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2721.56s">Is</a> Logan one of the 11 designated airports? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2723.581s">»»</a> No. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2725.328s">And</a> for those families who are returning that we're aware of, I think what I heard you say, and I just want to make sure I understand, is you're attempting to get in touch with those families, making sure they're aware of the federal recommendation that they self-quarantine, but they can choose not to, and they can choose to send their children to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2749.515s">Is</a> that what I heard?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2781.556s">And</a> are they all sort of approaching this the same way, which is it sounds like to make sure the families are aware of the recommendation and then the families make that decision to either send or not?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2802.172s">And</a> do you have any words of comfort maybe to offer <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2808.663s">the</a> community that has not traveled to China but hears about, back to the hysteria, but hears about students returning from China who may be attending school, whether that's parents of students or staff or administrators.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4090.359s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5156.897s">I</a> noticed that in the report there were a number of retirements and about 60% of those retirements were not happening in the summer, but they were happening after the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5167.662s">And</a> I was just wondering, is that normal? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5171.544s">Is</a> 60% typical? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5173.905s">Or</a> is this sort of an anomaly of the year?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5209.44s">So</a> it's normal that 60% of our resignations slash retirements would happen during the school, the operating school year, or is that unusual in some way?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5229.094s">Okay,</a> that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5232.695s">And</a> then I was also reading that we have like 60, I think it's like 61 people on leave of absence, is that correct?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5266.581s">And</a> is that <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5267.566s">Again,</a> is that like a typical year, or is this unusual in some way?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5273.749s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6893.615s">Is</a> there a district driven communication plan to families prior to the info sessions?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6928.387s">Okay,</a> so I'd like to make a motion that something central comes from the district no later than February 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6937.509s">that</a> includes a number of items just so that families who may not have been paying attention to this last year because their kid was a distant fourth grader and now they're a fifth grader has some sort of backdrop information and some clarity in addition to the dates, which it's great that we have all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6956.576s">So</a> I'd like to see a communication that includes our rationale for the lottery process selection, a description and rationale of any student exemptions from the lottery, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6966.998s">An</a> outline of all lottery pools, including school-specific breakdowns and sub-lotteries for students on IEPs and 504s if they apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6974.304s">And</a> then a schedule and timeline of key dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6977.066s">I</a> think a consistent communication with all of that information is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6981.669s">So</a> I'm making a motion to ask the district to do that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6996.269s">So</a> I make a motion that the district send a communication to all fifth grade families no later than February 14th, 2020 to outline the lottery as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7004.315s">Number</a> one, the rationale for lottery process of selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7007.658s">Number</a> two, a description and rationale of any student exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7011.501s">Number</a> three, an outline of all lottery pools, including school specific breakdowns and sub lotteries for students on IEPs or 504s if they exist, and a schedule and timeline of key dates.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7041.734s">I</a> think last year there was some conversation about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7047.108s">some</a> students on IEPs were part of a separate lottery than the students without IEPs so that there was balancing happening, or 504 is potentially right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7060.759s">So</a> I think if there are sub-lotteries, I just want people to clearly understand <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7066.704s">what</a> those components and factors are so that when they get to the info session with you, they can come with informed questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7078.628s">And</a> if they can't get there, we have given them the top to bottom understanding of what our plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7086.75s">And</a> I think this is such a huge improvement over the communication path of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7091.453s">As</a> a fifth grade parent myself, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7094.515s">And</a> I get a lot of questions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7097.136s">So</a> that's the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7098.597s">And</a> so that's the clarification on that.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7154.946s">member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7156.767s">I</a> would also like to make a motion that we refer our middle school lottery process to the communications community engagement and strategic planning subcommittee for a view of our current communications and onboarding practices related to middle school selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7172.875s">I'd</a> like to further ask that the subcommittee report back to the school committee no later than October 31st of 2020 with any recommendations for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7182.56s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7478.556s">Thank</a> you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7483.099s">Just</a> a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7485.521s">Are</a> all the forms that are needed on our website, it seemed like as I read this, that the caregiver authorization affidavit is not on the website, but available in the Parent Information Center only?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7502.46s">Yeah,</a> the caregiver authorization affidavit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7505.982s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7507.443s">And</a> then just a couple of other things about the form that sort of prompted some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7513.747s">So</a> when we talk about school assignment, perhaps we can provide a more precise web link than medfordpublicschools.org because I think once they land there, it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7526.363s">particularly</a> clear how they would get to that listing of streets and school assignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7533.185s">So</a> there's probably a more precise path.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7539.347s">No,</a> what I'm saying is this instructs people to go to www.medfordpublicschools.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7545.669s">They</a> would then have to hunt to get to the street listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7550.82s">So</a> if we if exactly so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7553.623s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we can provide sort of a clear path for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7560.732s">And</a> then the flyer also says our after school program is first come first serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7565.635s">And</a> it sounds like that may not entirely be true.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7580.123s">So</a> can we make sure that this flyer is updated so that it at least doesn't lead us down a path that is inaccurate potentially? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7587.647s">She's</a> doing that right now as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7589.108s">OK,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7591.109s">And</a> then the <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7595.676s">Other</a> comment that I had about the process in general is there's just been a tremendous amount of discussion about kindergarten in the last few weeks all over social media and specifically there are a large number of parents weighing charter schools versus Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7611.308s">This</a> is happening in particular this year because some surrounding communities are at their charter caps so now Medford families are being selected in the lottery in larger numbers than in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7620.956s">I</a> believe some families have already had to commit to a charter based on the charter school's deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7625.919s">And</a> all this has happened prior to any rollout of our kindergarten related communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7631.042s">The</a> questions from families, from new families are similar at this year, year over year over year at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7638.826s">But</a> one recurring thing that I continue to hear and I get emails about all the time is that <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7644.147s">Medford</a> does not seem to be super responsive to parent inquiries and requests for information or even tours of the schools outside of this official kindergarten rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7655.3s">And</a> it's not allowing us to put our best foot forward and I think we have a really great <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7660.205s">best</a> foot to put forward at the right time when parents are making kindergarten decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7666.346s">So</a> I think a question that I have for you is what are our protocols and policies around fielding requests for information from incoming families as well as tours?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7739.691s">So</a> I'm not hearing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7742.834s">And</a> of course, I'm assuming that that is happening in some cases, but I think there's a number of cases where that is also not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7750.359s">So</a> I guess the question is, if we are hearing from families who are saying, I reached out in some way and I didn't get a response, who should we direct those folks to?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7779.775s">And</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7781.155s">I've</a> never personally had that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7784.916s">However,</a> I've seen it and been contacted by lots of people who have had that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7790.839s">And</a> I just want to make sure that, particularly in that super anxious time, especially for our first time families, that <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7798.561s">they</a> get to see in action how amazing our programs are before they are forced to make decisions to go somewhere else that may not necessarily be the best fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7811.927s">So</a> whether that is or not is I think for parents to decide in that context, but I also want to make sure that they don't make those decisions because they couldn't hear from us or get their questions answered.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7829.773s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7830.253s">So</a> when people reach out to me, I will make sure that I direct them to you in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7835.078s">Um,</a> and then I also would like to make the motion that we refer our kindergarten orientation practices to the communications community engagement and strategic planning subcommittee for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7844.688s">The</a> subcommittee will review current communication and community engagement practices related to kindergarten orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7851.696s">And</a> the subcommittee will report or recommend any revisions to the current plan and approach to the school committee here by no later than September 30th of 2020.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8255.299s">So</a> I make a motion that the school committee refers our kindergarten orientation practices to the communications, community engagement, and strategic planning subcommittee for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8265.222s">The</a> subcommittee will also review current communication and community engagement practices related to kindergarten orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8271.624s">The</a> subcommittee will recommend revisions to the current plan and approach to the school committee by September 30, 2020.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10199.663s">I</a> am really excited that we are pursuing a strategic planning effort as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10204.845s">I</a> feel like we've heard about a lot of strategic plans or the need for strategic plans in Medford over the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10211.448s">And</a> I really do believe that it's because we are sort of at this proverbial tipping point where we all recognize that we cannot continue without a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10220.331s">Our</a> strategic plan is an important roadmap and not something we can or should expect to come together quickly or easily, as you guys know because you've been at this for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10230.034s">But</a> with our strategic plan process, we have an opportunity to listen to our many constituents <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10234.673s">and</a> revisit things we've long accepted, including things like simply our mission statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10239.599s">Our</a> strategic plan, when it is completed, is also an overarching communication to the community about who we are, where we are going, and when we will get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10247.89s">It</a> allows us to be open and transparent about what we plan to do and when. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10252.113s">It</a> also sets the foundation for us all when the community asks, have we ever thought about X, or what does Medford do about Y? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10259.939s">It</a> will allow us to say, yes, we have thought about X, and we're going to complete that in year 20, fill in the blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10266.064s">Because</a> before we can get there, we have to do A, B, and C for that to be meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10272.509s">Perhaps</a> most importantly, it provides guidance to our spending choices so that we can spend wisely, and we can have real dialogue about the resources we need to execute the plans, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10282.532s">accelerate</a> certain parts, or add new ideas to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10285.793s">So</a> I want to thank you guys for all of this work, and I'm super excited that I get to be the chair of the communications, community engagement, and strategic planning subcommittee as we embark on this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10296.554s">I</a> would like to make a motion to move this draft strategic plan to that committee so that we can start that process of that more in-depth look and work on our discussion around strategic planning and the entire process moving forward.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10832.936s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10834.477s">So</a> having heard Sharon's question and Melanie's question, <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10838.7s">I</a> feel like the answer to both of these questions is that we have to be both patient and impatient at exactly the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10847.066s">None</a> of these things can happen by June, July. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10852.329s">Small</a> things can happen, but we're talking about moving a massive organization in a totally specific direction, and that takes a tremendous amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10867.068s">In</a> the best of situations, resources are not an issue and you can just commit to moving in that direction, but we have sort of added complication that we do not have endless resources to execute on every single thing that we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10881.255s">So</a> sort of patience and impatience is an interesting balance to have to strike when you do strategic planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10888.159s">I</a> think the other thing that happens often when you do strategic planning in any capacity is <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10893.41s">What</a> you thought was done is often really just the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10898.291s">So</a> something like an acronym, when you start talking to other people, you may find that that acronym really just doesn't speak to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10907.773s">And</a> I think I want us all to be open to the fact that this is the beginning of a process that is going to take some time and be

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1052.528s">School</a> committee woman, Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1055.922s">One</a> other thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1057.063s">Maybe</a> we can just combine all of these together, but we should have some sort of committee of the whole before this whole process gets started so that we can put our put our thoughts together and understand what we think we want to see in terms of the data that comes to us from a budgeting perspective so that when the department chairs are working to put their stuff together, if there's something <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1078.535s">particular</a> that we know that we'll want to see that we can give everyone that advanced notice so that they can get that together rather than feeling like they have to respond to that stuff on the fly as those questions come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1089.678s">Because</a> I think there's things that I can think of that I'd like to be able to see in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1094.06s">And</a> I'm sure everyone has those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1095.7s">So</a> I'm not sure if we can do something in terms of budget planning before this whole process starts so that we can just all be on the same page about what to expect.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1262.862s">Motion</a> to approve this schedule as amended.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2987.083s">I</a> just wanted to say that this report was really easy to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2992.024s">I</a> think for me as a new school committee member, but I think anybody read this, they would really understand what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2999.026s">And</a> I think that's so important because these things sort of fly across in sound bites. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3004.147s">And</a> I read it and I said, I don't even have one question about what I just read. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3008.308s">So</a> I thought that was really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3011.329s">I</a> also wanted to especially thank the teachers who are <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3018.231s">Working</a> through co-teaching and a new curriculum at the same time, I know how hard that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3026.376s">Either</a> one of those things is really difficult, but to sort of change your stand and deliver approach as you're changing the content you're being asked to deliver as well is incredibly time-consuming, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3039.265s">to</a> both you and all the teachers that are making that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3042.147s">I</a> know it will be really worthwhile.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3073.66s">Yeah,</a> that's wonderful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3882.477s">School</a> Committee Woman, Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3885.03s">Thanks,</a> I am hoping that I'll be able to be there as well, so I'll check my calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3889.592s">One</a> of the things that this makes me think about is sort of what do we already do when it comes to financial literacy at all levels of education in Medford, and I think there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3906.288s">misinformation</a> out there about what we do do, what we don't do, what other people do, what other people don't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3912.913s">And</a> I think it would just be really nice for particularly parents that have younger children who haven't gone through the whole system yet to just understand something about how we approach financial literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3926.627s">whether</a> it's elementary school, middle school, or high school, and just give people a familiarity with what those structures are that exist today. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3933.07s">So</a> I don't know if there's a way we can do some sort of update or some sort of press article about what our offering is from the beginning to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3942.494s">I</a> think that would be really valuable for lots of different people for lots of different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3947.316s">So</a> just more a suggestion than anything, but I think it would be helpful.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3956.789s">Is</a> that a motion or? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3957.529s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3959.73s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we put out a press release that gives that sort of end-to-end perspective of financial literacy across the district.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3921.59s">Can</a> I also make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to revisit our capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3927.696s">There</a> are new members of the committee our New leader is in place and I think it is time to start to talk about that capital plan again I don't recall the bathrooms being on there in a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3941.088s">So</a> I think it's time for us to have that conversation In a committee of the whole meeting Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3946.893s">Thank</a> you
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5719.693s">School</a> Committeewoman Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5722.549s">How</a> does our substitute rate compare to surrounding communities?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5752.145s">Do</a> you have a number that you could share about somebody that you think is sort of relative?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5792.544s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6332.705s">School</a> Committeewoman Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6335.28s">Just</a> another question about the adjustment Councilors in the FY 19 budget year where they're the same number of adjustment Councilors at each of the elementary schools.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6361.551s">And</a> is that true in the current budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6364.683s">in</a> the FY20?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6371.608s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6372.048s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6465.821s">The</a> field trips, is it a particular field trip that's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6468.522s">Because</a> even if it's just the buses, that's still not <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6473.778s">much</a> in terms of an entire district worth of kids going on field trips.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6494.171s">And</a> is there some way to provide a description of the field trips that the district pays for at all various levels?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6539.701s">OK,</a> yeah, I'm not interested in sort of backpedaling into FY 19, but I would like to think about looking at how the district is paying for field trips at various levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6550.336s">So</a> I do think we need to come up with some way to do that, but totally open to. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6555.377s">how</a> that happens.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6568.24s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6568.5s">And</a> that's where I'm trying to get an understanding of what are we paying for and what aren't we paying for and what are we asking students and families to pay for what are we asking or what our PTO is paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6579.723s">So</a> I think that bigger picture of <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6582.32s">field</a> trips and ensuring that we're providing similar educational experiences across all of our buildings and across our students sort of starts with money and what we're paying for here to sort of start to build out that bigger story and that bigger picture.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6609.631s">Yeah,</a> that would be great.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7624.781s">We</a> had a similar request for free cash last year to replace, I think it was sort of the same exact story, replace aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7635.839s">equipment</a> that's no longer going to be supported when they stop supporting Windows 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7640.462s">And</a> now we're here doing that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7643.224s">My</a> question is what's left in terms of what other equipment is unreplaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7649.669s">Because</a> I think each time we do this, people think we have solved this problem of our aging equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7655.753s">And</a> if we have, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7657.875s">But</a> if we haven't, I want to be able to talk about that as well.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7780.71s">Yeah,</a> and I would not advocate for us to do it in one year, because then we have to do it in one year again in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7786.633s">So</a> I definitely want to move away from that kind of a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7790.634s">But</a> what I want to make sure that we do in this upcoming budget cycle is be really transparent about what's in the budget, what's not in the budget, so that <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7799.66s">our</a> colleagues on the city council understand that if they say yes to $100,000 of free cash or $200,000 of free cash, that that hasn't solved the totality of our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7811.804s">I</a> think to do that, we need to be able to say, this is the goal, this is where we want to be, and this is where we are, and this is how long it's going to take for us to sort of get out of the position that we're in and get to this place where we're replacing our technology every year, 20%, 20%, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7829.761s">But</a> I think in order to do that, there needs to be a clear description of where we're at, and are we even at the place where we can start 20%, 20%, 20%, or are we in a hole, so to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7842.488s">And</a> I think we need to be really clear and transparent about that in the budget process, so that when the city council feels like they've solved a problem, we can say, yes, you have, in fact, solved this problem, or no, we have not solved that problem, and we have more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7856.735s">So</a> I just want the folks who, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7860.033s">ultimately</a> have to approve our budget, but also the community to understand exactly where we are and exactly what we do and don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7867.716s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7868.096s">So</a> is that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7870.657s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7981.243s">I</a> will take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7982.303s">I</a> was pretty plugged into the budget process during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7985.125s">And</a> I don't recall anything that resonated to me in quite that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7989.186s">So</a> perhaps it's a matter of being more clear about what those things need to look like so that the picture is <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7996.883s">clear</a> to people outside of the school department, because I think that's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8000.806s">But</a> I will go back and take a look at that again, and we can talk about it in the upcoming budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8006.269s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8238.512s">Yeah,</a> I think when we talk about the technology conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8241.902s">I</a> think we need to be really clear that there's two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8245.484s">There's,</a> do we have at our disposal the amount that we need, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8252.487s">And</a> then, do we have the means to maintain that base? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8256.728s">And</a> I think the answer to both of those questions right now is no, no and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8262.031s">At</a> least that's my opinion, and we can talk about that during the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8266.473s">But</a> I think it's important to be clear about having two real needs with two <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8272.196s">particular</a> amounts of money, both which are bigger than we have the budget for. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8277.999s">And</a> I want to make sure that we're just being honest about that and the ways that our district is receiving technology right now through PTOs, filing grant requests, all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8292.187s">So</a> there's technology flowing in that we're not paying for and we're really lucky about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8296.849s">But</a> at the same time, that equipment has to be maintained as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8300.391s">So</a> we have to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8302.487s">both</a> are we where we need to be in terms of do we have enough equipment to do all the things that we need to do to provide a quality education. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8309.172s">And</a> then do we have the money to maintain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8311.374s">And</a> I want to make sure that in the budget conversation that we really clearly have both of those conversations so that the community understands truly where we are and what we cannot do in the confines of this budget because we are required by law to submit a balanced budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8328.166s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8328.387s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8329.467s">that</a> there's no magic that makes all of that happen at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8332.728s">And</a> I want us to be really transparent about that.<h2><a href="../2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E/2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E.html">School Committee meeting May 20, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6627.973s">Hi</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6628.733s">I'm</a> going to talk about some of the activity that we've done this year at the Brooks, and I want to start by saying a huge thank you to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6636.941s">for</a> their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6638.262s">This</a> is our second year presenting to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6641.044s">And</a> last year we talked at length about the state of the grounds at the Brooks specifically and also across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6649.311s">And</a> that picture on the lower right is a picture of our new field, which we were able to break in just in time for field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6656.217s">And</a> it has truly been a game changer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6658.639s">So</a> thank you to this committee for all the support that you provided and to the mayor for helping make this happen in collaboration with the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6667.735s">So</a> we're back this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6670.196s">And</a> what we decided to do as a collaborative group is talk a little bit about what has been going on in our buildings this year, but also try to be efficient in the things that we want to talk to you about for consideration, because they truly are shared concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6686.099s">So</a> we sort of decided to divvy things up, but I want to say that from a perspective of what happens in the Brooks building, we 100% support what you'll hear from all the rest of the schools in terms <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6697.775s">what</a> their priorities and concerns are for you guys to consider, and I think that goes kind of all around the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6703.658s">We're</a> all very lined in sort of what the opportunities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6707.701s">Our</a> leadership team changes every year, and so this year we welcomed Mitzi Galante to the co-chair position, and Mike Allen will be cycling off for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6716.786s">And</a> we have a new monitor because our monitor only serves for one year at a time, and the rest of the committee stays in place for next year through an election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6727.313s">Our</a> spending recap looks a lot like what it has looked like in past years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6732.177s">On</a> the left side, you see the recurring costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6733.878s">So</a> it's things like in-school enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6736.02s">And</a> we divvy up the enrichment budget across all of the grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6740.403s">So</a> there is the same amount of money being spent, albeit perhaps different amounts of things happening in the different school grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6749.711s">We</a> support field trips and teacher supplies, which are <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6753.003s">sort</a> of the next significant component of our budget, field day, library resources quite specifically, and then sort of a hodgepodge of additional items. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6762.851s">Last</a> year we talked to you about establishing our version of a grants committee process, which is really a process for the community to talk to us about. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6769.764s">what</a> they think is important and how we might spend money when we are able to raise in excess of our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6777.028s">This</a> year we authorized $5,000 in spending, and that money will be spent across Chromebooks, reading intervention and teacher resources, coding mice for the technology classes, phys ed equipment, and stage and performance equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6792.818s">The</a> field remediation contribution also happened in this fiscal year, so it's on there, but that's sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6799.133s">happened</a> in the middle of the summer, so it doesn't have a great home. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6804.476s">So</a> far this year, we've raised about $45,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6807.578s">About</a> 10% of those funds are generated from corporate sponsors, and the remaining 90% is raised across a variety of events that happen in our community, particularly with event attendance and activity participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6823.303s">Fall</a> Fest is one of our biggest fundraisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6825.732s">We've</a> already set the date for next year on October 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6829.988s">And</a> the read-a-thon trivia night and our annual talent show are the biggest sources of fundraising for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6837.675s">Other</a> than that, we do talk about favorites like our ice cream social, our open mic nights, which are really amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6846.202s">I'm</a> always so shocked at how fearless little kids are in front of a microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6852.006s">So</a> there's lots of other things that we do across the year, but we really try to create a balance of events from a fundraising standpoint so there is truly something for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6860.518s">One</a> of the things that I wanted to talk about tonight from a consideration perspective is that, especially hearing a lot of the conversation already this evening about English language arts reading support, the libraries at the elementary level are woefully understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6877.594s">We</a> have a part-time librarian that supports four elementary schools, and it is near impossible for her to make any forward progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6886.627s">I</a> think there are three issues in the library as I see them and as we have discussed sort of as a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6892.53s">One</a> is that a part-time person cannot possibly support four elementary schools, that an identifiable library curriculum does not exist at all grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6902.475s">And</a> frankly, it's unfair to think that our part-time resource is going to ever have the capacity to build a meaningful curriculum for the library given <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6912.813s">the</a> huge administrative burden that she carries in her part-time capacity across four schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6918.156s">And</a> the third thing, and I would say sort of this is in order of importance, but the third thing is that there is no meaningful budget from the district to purchase new library books. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6928.922s">So</a> when the science curriculum rolls out, how is the library being sourced with books that are relevant and appropriate to that activity? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6938.187s">And</a> what does happen in practice is that <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6941.312s">you</a> know, PTOs like ourselves and I think all the other elementary school PTOs provide lots of support in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6947.777s">But</a> it's sort of a parent-driven approach versus an educator curriculum-driven approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6953.422s">So</a> I think there's a lot of opportunity in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6957.165s">Even</a> if we could get to two headcounts so that each librarian could focus on two buildings, it would be a light year of difference from what happens today. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6966.273s">I</a> mean, the poor librarian, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6969.235s">Lannan,</a> is just <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6970.85s">driving</a> all over the city, covering people who are out, trying to handle all the administrative activity in each of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6976.851s">And</a> I think when we talk about English language performance, a real meaningful library experience in a building can really be a game changer for kids who are struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6989.433s">And</a> somebody who can help them learn to love to read on their own and for pleasure can be a really important aspect of what needs to happen to kind of bring those kids along. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6999.872s">I'm</a> going to turn it over to the Columbus now for their report.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8284.961s">And</a> I just wanted to say thank you to all the parents who have been in the room since 7 tonight to be here to show you guys that we all do really believe in the things that we're telling you and there's <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8297.61s">a</a> whole bunch of folks in the room from all the elementary schools across the city here tonight for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8306.053s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8754.722s">Exactly,</a> so we're very new. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8757.288s">And</a> part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we don't flame out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8761.191s">So</a> what we decided to do at the beginning of this year is that for each event, one of the PTOs who is a registered 501c3 assumes the role as the reporting PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8771.639s">That</a> means they assume insurance risk, tax reporting liability, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8777.676s">and</a> a requirement to honestly handle all the money that flows in through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8782.86s">And</a> that's actually not a small task. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8785.062s">We</a> had to buy additional insurance for the Disney raffle because the money coming in was in excess of what we normally do. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8792.307s">So</a> what happens is each year we sit down and say, what events are we going to do and who's going to report? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8798.492s">So</a> all of that money is reporting under a registered 501c3 amongst the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8804.216s">So</a> we are not a 501c3 independent organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8807.488s">because</a> we are really just there to fundraise and push the money back to the schools where the PTOs can decide how best to spend it.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8818.718s">Thousands</a> of dollars, less insurance, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8821.34s">Yep,</a> yep.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8824.583s">Right,</a> because we would have to form a different board, which is challenging because we're already <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8831.285s">the</a> same group of folks that show up to every last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8834.987s">So</a> we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8837.229s">We</a> have acknowledged that we need to continue to talk about it because we could get there quickly, but we're not there yet.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8904.328s">So</a> that again, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8905.868s">So</a> let me give you three comments about that topic because I know it continues to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8911.651s">The</a> first comment is that the two middle school PTOs <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8915.798s">Neither</a> one of them has officially reached out to us to say they want to be part of an alliance with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8922.282s">And</a> if, in fact, they did, we would definitely want to talk to them about what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8927.546s">What</a> happens and what plays well from a fundraising perspective at an elementary school level could be quite different. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8933.59s">And</a> we want to think carefully about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8936.212s">If</a> anyone wants to understand the rules in more detail, we would be happy to talk about the details of those rules that are being considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8942.296s">But</a> frankly, they are being considered <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8944.718s">and</a> run through the boards of the respective PTOs, because those PTOs are assuming all the risk in these operations, and they do need to be okay with what those requirements are, because they are the holders of the risk, the reporting requirements, the compliance, and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8962.501s">And</a> the third thing is that I believe that we have already agreed that we are totally open to collaborating with the Middle Schools on the Wizards game next year, which was a huge hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8972.168s">We</a> need to figure out exactly how we will do that and exactly how the middle schools want to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8977.75s">But</a> that's sort of a conversation that I anticipate we won't have until the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8982.192s">As</a> I think those two boards are also going through a number of transitions and a number of other things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8986.934s">So</a> if anyone wants some additional detail about the facts of the memorandum of understanding that we're working on across the schools, we're happy to reach out and talk to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8997.418s">But</a> to be perfectly clear, the two middle school PTOs, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9002.26s">have</a> not yet reached out to us in an official capacity to talk about that.<h2><a href="../2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg/2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg.html">Medford School Committee meeting Monday, December 17, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4463.875s">So</a> there are a number of people who definitely won't win anything tonight, namely our raffle captains. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4473.019s">So</a> there were 10 folks who were identified as captains at the outset of this effort who were expressly prohibited from buying tickets, although they were asked to spend lots and lots and lots of hours helping other people be eligible to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4486.243s">Our</a> raffle captains included Christy Aveno, Jen Conti, myself, Melissa Maywalt, Maureen McSweeney, Doug Nagengast, Gary Pabst, Cheryl Rodriguez, Bob Russo, and Bailey Schendel. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4498.033s">A</a> special thank you to Tamara Morrow, who is the treasurer of the Brooks, and she is a raffle captain and the person who is responsible for the finances, the reporting, and raffle compliance, which is no small feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4512.005s">We've</a> learned a lot about raffles. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4515.475s">But</a> she has done an immensely huge task with ease. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4520.357s">So</a> we sold 4,824 tickets and received some donations along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4526.539s">Our</a> gross sales were $24,178. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4528.5s">Yay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4538.482s">After</a> we pay our raffle expenses, and we filed our required tax returns, and we pay our gaming taxes, our schools will each receive over $4,000, which is a huge addition to all of the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4550.676s">So</a> that's $4,000 to each elementary school, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4554.96s">the</a> end of the bath. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4557.282s">We're</a> just getting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4558.163s">We</a> have two more events planned this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4560.366s">Our</a> electronics recycling will return, and we'll have a Wizards game in the spring as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4565.631s">And</a> there will be more to come on both. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4568.013s">But</a> the reason that we're here is to pull the winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4570.696s">So</a> the raffle wheel is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4572.969s">It's</a> quite full. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4575.85s">We</a> did mix everything around and shake it up and the wheel can be spun a few more times for good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4582.653s">The</a> first prize that we would like Dr. Edouard-Vincent to pull is the grand prize winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4587.555s">The</a> grand prize of the raffle is $5,000 in Disney gift cards or a cash equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4594.019s">The</a> grand prize winner can, at their option, use the gift cards to book a vacation at a Disney resort or Disney cruise. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4600.204s">Shannon</a> Demos, the assistant principal at the Brooks School, is a local resident Disney expert and has volunteered her time to help the winner plan their vacation, if they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4611.194s">The</a> $5,000 grand prize may or may not cover the whole cost of a vacation, including airfare, accommodation, and dining, subject to the winner's booking preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4618.94s">You</a> can go to Disney all kinds of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4622.082s">So</a> $5,000 is kind of a blank canvas for whoever that winner is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4627.204s">The</a> winner must be 18 years of age or older and a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4632.446s">The</a> winner must claim their prize in seven business days, so excluding Christmas, which is a federally recognized holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4637.689s">This</a> means the prize must be claimed by December 27th at 5 or we will draw a new winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4642.971s">So</a> if you would do the honors and pull the winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4647.669s">Spin</a> that drum. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4648.75s">Reach</a> in there really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4650.271s">Whoa,</a> that is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4653.694s">It</a> is quite full.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4675.685s">Does</a> anyone know Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4679.008s">Does</a> anybody know Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4682.611s">We</a> will take that and call her. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4685.313s">And</a> then if you would also pull one more ticket, there is a second place prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4689.716s">It</a> is a $250 Disney gift card. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4693.92s">The</a> same rules apply about claiming the prize and US residents and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4698.123s">But</a> the second prize winner will be pulled now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4700.825s">It</a> is packed.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4704.908s">So</a> next year we'll also be on the hunt for a slightly bigger drum.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4732.122s">So</a> thank you very much for playing along here and pulling our winners. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4736.023s">So</a> we'll take those from you, and we will take the wheel and empty it out and get it back to the Irish-American as well.<h2><a href="../2018-10-17_DHppOEsfgwM/2018-10-17_DHppOEsfgwM.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 15, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=936.729s">Sure,</a> it's Jenny Graham, 7 Raleigh Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=944.937s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=946.679s">Do</a> you guys want to introduce yourselves before we start?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=956.592s">So</a> you guys have a flyer in your pockets and what that outlines is some work that has been going on across the four elementary schools since <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=966.327s">this</a> summer to try to collaborate on some joint fundraising activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=972.911s">So</a> as you may know, all of the elementary schools have their own PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=976.813s">We</a> all have our own board structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=979.374s">We</a> all have our own events that we hold annually, and we all try new things all of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=985.197s">And</a> this past summer, a group of folks convened to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=989.299s">are</a> there ways that we can work together? <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=992.32s">Last</a> spring we had a small but successful joint fundraiser and it was a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=997.523s">So</a> I think at that first meeting about 20 or so people, maybe 25 joined us with representation from all four of the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1007.707s">And</a> so what we did in that initial meeting was talk about just some kind of intent and ground rules in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1014.782s">how</a> we would work together, and we really came up with a couple of overarching rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1020.45s">One</a> is just that the goal is for us to get to know each other in a little bit of a different capacity than we have an opportunity to on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1029.511s">Also</a> to do some joint fundraising in places where the fundraising doesn't cannibalize other efforts from each of the individual schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1038.275s">So</a> we thought really carefully about things like things that are happening already in certain schools and the calendar and trying to figure out kind of where to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1046.418s">And</a> then we brainstormed some ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1048.098s">And</a> there were like 20 or so ideas that we talked about in that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1053.501s">And</a> what we did agree to is we were going to do a couple so that we didn't try to <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1057.807s">kind</a> of boil the ocean and have too many things to do and have everybody get fatigued. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1062.289s">So</a> out of that meeting, we actually sort of locked in on a couple of different ideas, and that's what's on your one-page summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1072.014s">And</a> Christy's going to talk about the first item, which we are just launching, and then Cheryl will talk about the second one, and then we'll be happy to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1080.519s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1363.531s">Cheryl,</a> do you want to talk about the second item?
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1442.962s">And</a> then the last event, well the last two events on your page, one planned for electronics recycling, which actually was the first thing we did last spring when we all worked together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1453.809s">It's</a> quick and easy, unlike learning the ins and outs of how to run a legal raffle in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1459.432s">That's</a> a different amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1462.434s">And</a> so we'll kind of cash in on quick and easy this spring as well with the electronics recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1468.658s">We</a> actually just last week decided that we have an upcoming professional day which is on election day and we'll be hosting a free skate at La Conte rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1480.211s">Bobby</a> Maloney was willing to work with us and we'll be charging five dollars for admission and the proceeds will be split between the four elementary schools and everyone is welcome to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1490.361s">They'll</a> have <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1491.142s">rentals</a> there for a small fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1492.984s">And</a> that was something that we at the Brooks have started doing on professional days is having something available for folks and for a small fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1502.291s">And</a> we decided that with something like that, having more folks interested in coming to it would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1508.236s">So</a> we'll be doing the very same thing with that event in terms of splitting the proceeds and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1513.897s">And</a> then I think as we go forward, we had some big ideas like having a gala where we honor teachers in the district and all kinds of like really cool things that just take a little bit more than a couple of weeks to pull together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1527.291s">So</a> we have some ideas on how to continue this momentum forward and it could mean <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1532.746s">kind</a> of bringing other schools into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1534.787s">But</a> one of the things we really wanted to do was start small enough that we could be successful, rather than trying to start too big and having the whole thing kind of burn out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1543.07s">So</a> we wanted to try to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1545.951s">I</a> think the big thing for us is everyone's going to come together to fundraise, and then the independent PTOs and their structures will make decisions on how their share is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1554.414s">So</a> there's no global obligation in terms of how the money will be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1559.696s">that</a> power will be kind of remaining with the individual PTOs who all have different needs for their students and their buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1566.502s">So</a> this is just hopefully a way to infuse dollars into the process rather than make decisions.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1576.811s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1581.775s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1582.075s">And</a> we'll be kind of all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1583.957s">We're</a> trying to schedule the dates and the times for all of the places where we'll be selling raffle tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1590.341s">And</a> we're going to try to be out in the community as much as we are in the elementary schools so that we have a bigger reach and a bigger draw to kind of bring into the fold when we look at proceeds.

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=971.789s">Jenny</a> Graham, 7 Ronalee Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=974.471s">So</a> back in the spring, we were <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=978.017s">talking</a> about PTO transparency, among other things, and really any sort of friends of group that works on behalf of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=987.021s">So</a> we drafted some guidelines around what kind of information PTOs should be sharing with the school committee via the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=997.865s">And</a> at that time, we had like a couple of <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1001.782s">Committee</a> of the Whole meetings where we worked with various members of PTOs across a number of the schools to build a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1009.564s">So</a> I built all of those questions into a Google Doc, which would need to be transferred somehow into ownership by MPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1019.747s">But</a> the Google Doc is there to say, from a reporting year standpoint, which most are July 1 to June 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1029.301s">Who</a> are the board of directors? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1031.003s">What</a> is the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1032.705s">Do</a> they have articles filed with the AG's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1035.508s">Do</a> they have insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1036.89s">There's</a> just a whole slew of questions that just talk about what's the mission? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1040.454s">How</a> do they go about the mission in a high-level way? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1043.537s">And</a> then what kind of expertise do they have on hand and where do they need support from MPS? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1049.969s">And</a> in particular, the place where that comes up a lot is around the treasury function of these PTO groups, because most of them are 501c3s. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1060.195s">And</a> there's a whole slew of requirements around proper reporting of everything from how you pay vendors, to raffles, to all kinds of things that people may or may not be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1075.623s">So</a> I think part of the policy also outlined <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1079.467s">an</a> ability for somebody from MPS to educate particularly the treasurers about their responsibilities so that as 501c3s and people who are well-intentioned, they're not inadvertently not following rules they didn't know existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1095.24s">So</a> I think that's kind of the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1097.501s">So</a> all of that kind of lays out in the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1100.102s">with</a> the goal being that once a year, you can go in, you can fill out the form, you can attach documents if you need to around bylaws when they're updated, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1110.808s">And</a> then at any point in time, there's some sort of visibility about all the groups who are working on behalf of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1118.513s">And</a> it then allows all of you to have some awareness when somebody says, hey, does so-and-so really <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1125.963s">have</a> an organization that is here to benefit Medford Public Schools, there's some way to know that without having to kind of scurry around and kind of check in with people you know or people you might think are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1138.986s">But</a> I think the other thing that kind of came out of that is certainly an interest in the PTOs working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1145.148s">And</a> on another night we'll talk about some of the work the elementary schools are doing together this year that we're excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1152.19s">But</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1153.106s">The</a> accounting piece is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1156.39s">It's</a> something that comes up even when we talk about some of the citywide joint fundraising that we're gearing up to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1162.809s">And</a> it's been a lot of legwork to kind of find the right people who have been able to help us do the right thing for the right reasons from a reporting standpoint so that none of us end up in trouble from a tax standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1177.938s">So</a> I think that's a big piece, especially for the treasurers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1181.439s">But</a> overall, just some sort of transparency for all of you to know who's out there, doing what, for whom, and when, and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1191.485s">But</a> it's pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1192.445s">It</a> shouldn't take more than a few minutes for people to fill out the form if they know who their board is and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1198.627s">But</a> it needs to make its way into your domain, I guess, from a Google Form and storage perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1205.509s">And</a> I certainly shouldn't have access to everybody's responses, which I do now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1209.671s">So</a> we just need to figure out how those mechanics move. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1213.652s">And</a> then they would also have to be released out to all the <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1218.28s">the</a> organizations, whoever has that list, so that they know that that's expected.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1258.095s">Yeah,</a> and there are some questions about, particularly from an accounting standpoint, there were a couple of questions in there to assess if somebody does this work for a living, there's probably not anything our training is going to tell them that they need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1272.561s">So</a> there is a mechanism to exempt folks who are particularly qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1277.802s">But</a> I think it will, from a volunteering perspective, I think it will also help people understand that there is support. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1284.768s">So</a> if you have somebody who, like myself, who has a finance degree but does not practice in accounting, conceptually, I think I could do that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1294.056s">But</a> without knowing about all the filings, there's no way that anybody would be able to get it right on a volunteer basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1300.161s">So</a> I think you'll see more people be willing to take on that really important job in these organizations if they know there's some support.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1336.857s">But</a> I think starting is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1339.4s">And</a> the other thing that we outlined in that policy is that you all have an expectation that these groups are going to come before you on an annual basis in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1349.615s">So</a> you can have a little bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1351.782s">information</a> from them about what they're up to and how they're doing it at a different level of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1358.446s">And</a> we outlined and laid out various ways that we would allow people to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1363.289s">But</a> the importance is, if somebody's out there raising $40,000 for Chromebooks, you all should know that that's happening, because it's a great news story that sometimes doesn't get told. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1375.536s">And</a> then there's all kinds of other things that happen on behalf of the schools that I think it's impossible for you guys to know about.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1566.958s">Right,</a> well, and we're actively working on an event at the Brooks right now, which is happening on Sunday, and we try to be careful about how we ask people for things, but we are, people are saying, hey Wegmans, can you help us? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1583.163s">Hey</a> Ajero, can you help us? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1586.112s">There</a> are things like that that go on in all the schools in all kinds of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1590.294s">But</a> all the money that we raise is going towards activities to support the Brooks, because that is our sole mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1599.039s">Where</a> I feel like the Kiwanis, I'm assuming, has a slightly broader mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1603.521s">And</a> so perhaps that's the way to exempt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1605.703s">Our</a> sole purpose as an elementary school PTO is to raise money <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1610.935s">to</a> benefit the school in which we're associated.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1621.019s">Right,</a> so there just may need to be some sort of amendment.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1692.241s">I</a> will say it takes about four minutes to fill out the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1697.267s">if</a> you have any level of infrastructure, even PTO level infrastructure, they can fill out this form in four minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1704.45s">So</a> I think if there are organizations like that that you guys want to be aware of, it's probably the least time intensive thing that they would get asked to do on any given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1715.415s">So</a> from that perspective, it should, and we tried not to make it burdensome because when you talk about PTOs and friends of the band and all that stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1725.807s">They</a> are all volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1727.349s">They</a> all have day jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1728.591s">They</a> all are hardworking folks who are doing this on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1731.815s">So</a> we tried really hard not to make it cumbersome for anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1734.778s">So</a> I would imagine that if you went down that road of asking folks like the Kiwanis to weigh in, that it would be no big deal for them to get it done.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10708.325s">So</a> if what we're trying to do is change hearts and minds, you don't do that with vague letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10715.77s">And</a> I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10717.282s">You</a> have to do some level of kind of standardized communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10721.563s">But</a> to date, the letters have all been fairly vague and not descriptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10728.265s">And</a> I totally understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10730.386s">But</a> if you want people to feel good about going to a school with a newly appointed principal who wasn't in the mix when people made their original selection and when that note went home, he could be really valuable in the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10745.628s">I</a> would definitely suggest that he's potentially someone who should be out in front of this and not waiting for parents to be upset and disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10757.371s">Because</a> if he's as fabulous as everyone says he is, and a former baseball player and an athlete and all of these great things, he should have some credibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10769.154s">All</a> he may need to do is put his face out there <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10773.749s">in</a> particular populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10775.231s">And</a> I'm a Brooks parent and I'm not somebody affected by this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10779.176s">But</a> I would also say, if you're going to run a lottery and you're going to pull 17 students, 20 students, however many students from a particular school, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10788.096s">I</a> would go ahead and send that information home and say, this is your last chance, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10793.578s">You</a> got 17, we are gonna pull 17 folks, 15, I don't care how many it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10798.42s">But</a> you have one more chance and then we're gonna do this and it's gonna be completely random. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10803.723s">Yeah,</a> I think you have to be transparent about the plan and what those consequences are.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10820.39s">Yeah,</a> I think, you know, as a parent, hearing partial lottery, it's never been clear what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10827.896s">And</a> I think it's because you guys aren't even clear exactly what that means even tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10831.579s">I</a> mean, that's why you're talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10833.22s">So</a> when you hear that, you might take from that whatever it is that you want to take from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10838.425s">But</a> if you're intending to do something specific, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10841.789s">Generally</a> speaking, giving people those specific guidelines helps them make the best decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10846.531s">And</a> you may see people make a different choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10850.472s">You</a> may not, but if you don't do it, you are certain to have 17, 20, however many parents who are infuriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10859.435s">So</a> at least you have a chance to do something to lessen the impact of the people who are upset.<h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1720.384s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1721.644s">So</a> as we talked about putting this form together, one of the things that I was concerned about as a member of the PTO was making sure that whatever we put together is really <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1735.535s">simple</a> and streamlined for the people who were asking to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1739.237s">So</a> in the spirit of fostering collaboration between all of these groups that work so hard and the central office and the school committee, I felt like it was really important to be able to say to folks, this is what it looks like and this is what we need from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1756.568s">And</a> really to be able to demonstrate how easy it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1760.07s">Largely,</a> what you see here is just the beginning of the Google form, and it's exactly what Kathy just read to you, so that there's a link between what this form says in its intent and the actual policy, which will undoubtedly go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1775.803s">But</a> as you fill this out, we don't want people to forget over time exactly what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1784.243s">So</a> the vision is that each year, the organizations would provide this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1789.367s">Anything</a> you see that has an asterisk next to it is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1794.69s">There</a> are things that are required by the end of the year, but they're not listed as things that are required in the form because the vision is that this form will be used at multiple steps across the year to be able to give information. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1808.199s">So</a> up front, when you first put this information together, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1812.753s">just</a> some basic information about the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1815.055s">So</a> who are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1815.916s">What</a> is your purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1817.398s">What's</a> your mission and vision? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1818.599s">Do</a> you have a website? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1820.081s">Are</a> you a 501C3? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1821.802s">So</a> just really very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1824.946s">We</a> also put in a place for the MPS staff liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1830.071s">So</a> whoever is your <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1832.073s">either</a> your building principal or your band advisor or whoever that person is that is your connection point to MPS would be listed here, as well as some sort of primary email for the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1847.481s">Anything</a> that's got a parentheses stating public, the vision is that those fields would be made available on a larger list so that the community could go out to the NPS website, they could see who all of these organizations are and there'd be some way to contact them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1862.07s">So</a> there'd be some aggregation of some of the information in these forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1867.701s">Then</a> we talk a little bit about the organization specifically, so fiscal year end. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1872.222s">And</a> that's really so that the superintendent's office has some track of the fiscal year end. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1878.443s">I</a> would assume that most would be June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1881.124s">But</a> in the event that there's something different out there, they shouldn't be looking for financial documents if the year end has not come and gone yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1888.246s">And</a> then Kathy referenced training. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1890.586s">And</a> one of the things that we talked about as being really important is <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1894.968s">providing</a> some sort of support for folks who may want to take on a role as treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1900.835s">In</a> particular, if you're a 501c3, there's real legal requirements associated with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1906.202s">So</a> even if you're good with numbers, it may not mean that you are equipped to be a treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1911.568s">So</a> this field allows the superintendent's office to know, I've already been trained by the superintendent's office, or I don't need to be trained because I am, in fact, a professional in this field, and I know everything I need to know about doing this correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1926.574s">Or,</a> in fact, I do need training. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1929.215s">So</a> that will allow the superintendent's office or whoever ultimately does this training to be able to say, OK, these are the five people for this year who need this training. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1941.156s">When</a> you flip forward, oh, I guess I have to answer these.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1960.901s">So</a> you can see, especially if you're somebody who has a website, a lot of this information would be available there anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1969.06s">and</a> it shouldn't take but a few seconds to fill this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1977.174s">Okay,</a> now we're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1981.375s">So</a> then here you would be saying, OK, so for this school year, what am I telling you about? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1985.857s">And</a> you'd go through and you'd say, this is for the current school year, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1992.159s">There</a> would be an opportunity for you to say, yes, I already have provided the superintendent's office a copy of my bylaws, because that's part of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2002.022s">Or</a> there are updates that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2003.743s">So</a> if I say that there are updates needed, I can actually just go ahead and add it right here, snap it in there, and then it's ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2012.599s">If</a> you scroll down just a little bit, there is some information here about your elected officials, so name, title, email address, and phone number, with a caveat that only the names would be listed on the public listing and that that central mailbox would be listed as the contact information for the organization so that we're not kind of publicizing personal emails and phone numbers of the folks who are working on these committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2044.738s">It's</a> too smart even for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2048.121s">A</a> couple of other things that we identified that would be important to know from a transparency perspective, does the organization carry insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2057.088s">Yes</a> or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2058.309s">And</a> if so, what kind of insurance is it that the organization carries? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2065.114s">And</a> then as you go forward, there's space for the financials to be uploaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2071.524s">whatever</a> your approved budget is can be uploaded, your end of year financials, and any regulatory filings can be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2078.706s">So</a> you submit this, the information goes to a central drive, and that would reside wherever you guys decide to put that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2085.829s">And</a> then if I needed to go back, I could go back and edit my response to add those other documents as they come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2090.83s">So</a> really simple, everything in one place, really intended not to be burdensome, but provide a level of transparency so that you all know <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2100.711s">exactly</a> what is happening in the organizations from a fiscal and from a reporting perspective.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2144.642s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2145.103s">So</a> they are required. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2146.283s">You</a> just can't, if we require it on the form, you'd be required to attach something when you fill out the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2151.826s">And</a> the vision is that that demographic information would be filled out at the start of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2156.578s">And</a> the financials for that year wouldn't be available till almost a year later. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2159.86s">So</a> it's just that the forum isn't that smart and can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2163.683s">But</a> the goal would be that whoever is responsible for making sure this information is coming in, if they're not seeing it 60 days after that fiscal year end that's listed there, that they'd be able to reach out and say, hey, where are your filings? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2176.993s">They're</a> not uploaded.
 <p>[Jenny Graham]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2292.216s">And</a> I know that there, I think we're planning for this to go into implementation next year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2298.719s">Um,</a> if there's any interest in a group to volunteer to go first to do the presentation to you guys, the Brooks PTO would be excited to do that sometime later this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2309.464s">So</a> we would be happy to, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2311.203s">put</a> together what we want to tell you and bring it to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2316.01s">If</a> there's room on the schedule for that, we'd be happy to do that just to give people a sense of what that would look like and that it's not that scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2327.272s">Thank</a> you.
