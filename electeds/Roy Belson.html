    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=282.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=283.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=287.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=296.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=307.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=326.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=333.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=342.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=346.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=349.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=351.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=354.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=361.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=375.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=379.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=385.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=389.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=407.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=417.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=421.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=426.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=428.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=439.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pertinent questions are these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=441.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it true that we're in a deficit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=444.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=448.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives available to meet our needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=453.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is this a one-time request or will there be another one, a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=458.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=461.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=464.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=469.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=475.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=480.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=487.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=490.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=501.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=508.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=511.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=519.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=529.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=532.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=539.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=547.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=555.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school administration, by law, is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=567.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=570.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=577.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=582.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=585.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=594.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=603.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=607.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=613.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=616.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, did they fail to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=628.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=630.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=636.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a need for an override, because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=650.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=653.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=657.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office, and the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=666.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=670.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=672.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=675.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=679.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=681.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=684.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=691.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=699.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=716.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=719.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=730.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=736.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=740.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=743.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=744.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=749.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=750.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=756.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=762.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=771.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=779.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=781.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=783.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=785.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=791.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're going to reassess it and the taxes are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=797.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably going to pay a little bit more for water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=801.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=808.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=823.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=826.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=829.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=832.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=838.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=841.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=847.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=851.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=855.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=859.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=861.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=863.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=871.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=876.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=880.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=883.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=888.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=895.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in a planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=909.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=912.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=921.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=924.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=931.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=936.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=937.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=941.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=953.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=959.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=960.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=974.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=979.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=983.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=985.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=994.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1004.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1009.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1015.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1018.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1020.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1022.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1031.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1037.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them, and we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1046.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want, and no school system is able to do that, and no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1053.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1057.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1063.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1065.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1067.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1068.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1071.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1089.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996, and I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1095.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1105.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville 23958, we just built a building so you can see where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1117.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1118.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you want to chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1121.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1128.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1130.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1141.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1153.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1155.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1159.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1161.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1169.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1173.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1178.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1180.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, you know, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1188.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1189.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1194.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're going to make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1205.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1207.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1208.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1210.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1211.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, the charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1212.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1214.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1234.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1243.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1247.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1249.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1255.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1260.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because our benefits are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1262.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're very good, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1264.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1268.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1271.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1277.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1280.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1287.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1291.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1294.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1299.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1308.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1311.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1316.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1317.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1319.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1327.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1330.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1333.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1342.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1344.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1346.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are voting against it, need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1351.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1359.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1362.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1366.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting or are going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1372.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, so the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1377.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1381.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1384.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election for the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1396.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1402.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1405.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1406.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1411.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1419.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1437.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1442.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1450.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1455.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1458.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1463.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1473.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1479.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1483.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1487.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1488.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1499.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1501.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1505.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1506.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1509.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1521.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1526.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1528.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1533.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1539.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1548.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1552.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1557.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1559.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1566.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1580.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1584.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1586.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1588.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1590.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1593.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1596.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1600.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1604.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1607.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1609.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1613.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1617.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1621.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1626.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1629.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1631.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=139.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=140.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=144.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=153.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=164.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=183.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=190.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=199.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=203.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=206.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=208.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=211.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=218.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=232.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=236.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=242.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=246.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=264.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=274.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=278.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=283.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=285.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=296.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pertinent questions are these is it true that it's we're in a deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=301.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=305.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=307.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: available to meet our needs Is this a one-time request or will there be another one a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=315.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=318.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=321.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=326.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=332.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=337.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=344.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=347.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=358.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=365.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=368.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=376.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=386.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=389.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=396.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=404.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=412.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school administration by law is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=424.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=427.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=434.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=439.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=442.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=451.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=460.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=464.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=470.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=473.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, that they failed to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=485.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=487.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=493.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a need for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=496.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=507.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=510.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=514.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=517.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=523.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=527.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=529.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=532.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=536.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=538.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=541.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=548.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=558.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=573.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=576.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=587.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=593.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=597.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=600.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=601.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=606.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=607.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=613.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=619.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=628.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=636.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=638.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now, they're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=642.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=648.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're gonna reassess it and the taxes are gonna go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=654.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably gonna pay a little bit more for water and sewer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=658.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=665.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=680.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=683.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=686.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=689.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=695.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=698.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=704.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=708.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=712.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=716.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=719.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=720.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=728.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=733.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=737.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=740.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=745.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=752.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in the planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=766.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=769.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=778.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=781.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=788.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=793.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=794.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=798.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=810.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=816.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=817.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=831.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=836.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=840.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=842.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment, over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=856.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=861.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=866.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=872.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up, you're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=877.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=879.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=888.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=894.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=901.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=903.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=906.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And no school system is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=908.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=910.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=914.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=920.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=924.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=925.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=927.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=928.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=929.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=952.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=964.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville, 23,958, we just built a building so you can see where that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=975.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you wanna chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=981.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=985.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=987.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=996.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1008.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1010.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1012.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1016.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1018.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1026.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charlene, the room boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1031.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1035.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1037.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1045.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1046.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1047.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're gonna make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1062.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1064.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1065.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1067.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1068.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, their charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1069.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1071.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1091.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1100.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1104.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1106.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1112.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us, because our benefits are good,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1120.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: very good, by the way, and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1125.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1129.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1134.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1137.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1144.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1148.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1151.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1156.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1165.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1168.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1173.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1174.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1176.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1184.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1187.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1190.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1199.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1201.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1203.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are voting against it need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1208.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1216.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1219.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1223.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1227.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1229.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, of the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1234.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1238.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1241.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election, or the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1253.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out, because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1259.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1262.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1263.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1268.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1276.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1294.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1299.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1307.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1312.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1315.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1320.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1330.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1336.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1340.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1344.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1345.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1356.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1358.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1362.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1363.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1366.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1378.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1383.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1385.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1390.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1396.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1405.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1409.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1414.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1416.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1423.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1437.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1441.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1443.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1445.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1447.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1450.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1453.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1457.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1461.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1464.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1466.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department, you don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1474.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1478.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1483.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1486.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1488.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=860.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: language instruction of the elementary grades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=862.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a tremendous program, and they've involved the Italian Consulate, and as you know, there's been many more activities besides just the language instruction that they brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=871.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I'm disappointed in tonight, Chikandra, is the fact that I thought you were gonna give me a Ferrari tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=877.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought that was part of the deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=879.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, having not received that, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=882.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sorry, but you know they did bring...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=900.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now watch what happens with this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=902.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, come on up and get it before I spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1058.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1060.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1064.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1183.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me go over them real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1186.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1190.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pursuant to our budget hearings that we had last Thursday, we reviewed some of the items that you brought up and tried to make some adjustments based on available funding that occurred during the few days that came after that meeting, and also based on what we perceived to be errors in the budget, at least in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1214.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in front of you, you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1217.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a budget document follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1218.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to go through it for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1223.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two resignations from the vocational school, faculty yielded $17,116 in savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1230.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One was in the auto shop and the other was part of the engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1234.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Salaries would allow some gapping between what they would have made if they had stayed and what we will replace them at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1242.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that gives us back $17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1246.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was a few resignations from the special ed faculty, and that will yield another $3,339.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1252.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these total areas, the two of them, give us $20,455 in available funding to be reapplied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1263.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one area that you actually voted the other evening was the banned travel account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1271.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that applause or is that just a... The band travel account got $3,000 that you actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1279.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, just so we understand, we have not changed the lines in your budget because until we make all the agreements tonight, we're not going to change things internally because once we change one page, we have to change five or six pages at least, minimum, because they all play off each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1295.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we're putting $3,000 into the band account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1299.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The elementary textbook account is going to be increased by $1,500 per school for a total of $6,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1305.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we put it in textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1307.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can be used for educational materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1308.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can be used for supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1310.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever the principal feels is important, but that gives them a little bit more back based on some of the discussion that was had the other evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1321.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The crew athletic program is expanding rapidly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1324.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had several meetings outside of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1326.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor has hosted several meetings, and there's several things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1330.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have two seasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1331.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order to supply the coaches, we are $8,400 short, so we added that to the athletic budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1338.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would cover that situation going forward this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1343.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there were two corrections to the principalships of the Andrews and the McGlynn Elementary that needed to be brought up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1351.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were using older numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1354.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That required $1,463 to go to the Andrews and $1,692 to the McGlynn Elementary Principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1363.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the total additions of recaptured funds evens out at $20,455.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1369.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The above adjustments and corrections will be made tonight if they're approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1374.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we progress toward the school budget, the end of the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1381.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be multiple changes based on personnel matters and non-salary costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1387.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there will be people that come and go, just like there are all year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1391.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will bring you up to date periodically in order to free up some funds, either to fill an account that might need a boost because of cost, or maybe to add something back that we couldn't add back in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1407.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as I said, we're not changing budget lines because it would affect too many page changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1412.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make the line adjustments once all decisions are made regarding the budget and provide copies to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1418.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, the second page of what you've been handed has a report on union settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1424.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I reported the other evening, the only union settlement at this point in time is a union settlement with the administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1433.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to recommend later on this evening to look at the unit building principles and other units are still being negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1442.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some discussion tonight about the teacher's contract and we're meeting with the teachers tomorrow as well as the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1448.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you information in that executive session as part of negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1454.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition, today we met extensively with Safe Havens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1459.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the group that is doing the comprehensive study of our security procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1464.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1467.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another visit will be coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1469.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've already had two visits now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1473.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when that is ready, we will come back with them with some recommendations regarding security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1479.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have kept the security line in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1484.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean that that will be the way we expend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1488.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be tied to the recommendations of Safe Havens and the wishes of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1493.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's see what that report tells us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1496.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a number of things we talked about today that are non-cost items that we think could be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1503.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some repositioning things that could also be helpful, no-cost items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1507.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are some things that are low-cost items that they think would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1513.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's let that report come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1514.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have the line item in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1518.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to spend against it until that report comes out, but we'll prepare ourselves to go in several directions and provide information to the committee so that we're ready to move once we see that report and once we reach some agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1532.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is that piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1536.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, one other item that came up the other evening that I think deserves some sort of mention tonight, and that's the Buildings and Grounds budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1546.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that the projects that will be most consistent with what the community is asking for and what we've seen must come from capital funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1556.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget will not meet those needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1561.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget reflects our savings in telephone, reflects our savings in various forms of energy, reflects our savings in other areas, in cleaning, that we believe we can absorb at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1579.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that allows the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1582.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to consider our capital requests, which I've given you some suggestions, but certainly others may be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1589.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as a committee and the mayor, you can sit and decide what you think is most appropriate as opposed to anything that I might think is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1599.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And certainly Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent will weigh in as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1603.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should tell you this evening that she would be here except the fact that her son Elijah had his wisdom teeth pulled and she's home giving him some comfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1612.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I spoke to her and I've gone over the materials and I know that she's in support of what I'm giving him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1618.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I feel comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1620.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what we've done so far since Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1623.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I would hope that the committee would support the budget as we've presented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1627.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of work has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1629.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Staff has worked very hard to make things fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1632.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budgets have contingencies in them, as we've talked about the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1635.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You never know when something new is going to pop up, and you never know when we're going to save something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1639.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the process of managing a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1642.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2256.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me try and answer some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2258.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, there's only one reduction in the vocational faculty, and that's for a program that only had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2264.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you can't sustain a program with one student, and the demand statewide has gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2270.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to be realistic when a program is not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2273.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2275.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't fund it just simply because we've always had it or had it for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2280.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Programs will come and go a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2281.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: New programs will emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2283.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be that coming forward a year from now, there might be a plumbing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2287.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There might be some other program that is more likely to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2292.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You talked about landscaping the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2293.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be something that's more attractive than the program that has one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2298.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the only reduction is the one teacher from the program that had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2304.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the dollars and cents go, I don't want to get into individuals right now, but I know that some of them moved closer to home and also got more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2313.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2314.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's usually an attraction for people in the trades when they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2320.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just simply need to pay attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2322.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money we have, we're not moving any money away from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2324.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just simply saying that at this point in time, in order to cover the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2328.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: variances or the different adjustments that you want, this is a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2333.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if a person costs more money, we'd go to undistributed to take that money from that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2337.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2338.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's ways to make that up, but we have to begin someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2343.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You take it where it exists initially, and then you move to cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2391.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so, so recruitment is underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2394.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we're certainly going to recruit people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2395.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to make every effort to bring people in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2398.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can I absolutely give you a, you know, a guarantee that we'll have the person we want by September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2403.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2404.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's highly likely we'll be aggressive out there to get people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2407.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are people out there who want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2410.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if a person has got good skills and ability, it may require getting a waiver from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in order to help them bridge the gap between their trade and also their teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2422.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we certainly have no intention of diminishing the faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2427.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2428.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: English teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2429.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Social studies teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2430.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2432.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll be at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2434.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2691.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, the mayor has got many projects in front of her, you know, and I'll let her answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2695.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I mean, obviously the schools were important, and I think she recognizes that has been generous over a period of time as as a predecessor has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2704.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just think we need to put a list together and see where we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2708.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think we, you know, need to give ourselves a multi year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2712.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't promise everybody everything all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2714.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if people see progress, I think they'll be encouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2717.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we can work from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2837.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to suggest to you, you might be more productive to refer it to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2843.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's clearly not a legal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2846.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clearly a way that the legislature funds these things statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2852.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons why they place people in different homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2855.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there may be housing available in some communities, sometimes not in others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2860.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But maybe there could be an option that the legislature could put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2863.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think that the solicitor can tell you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2866.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the legislature must do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2868.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the solicitor can tell you that, you know, the possibility exists if they choose to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2881.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They technically are, but it's always subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2883.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The famous last words of subject to appropriation, which means if they don't appropriate the money, they don't have to reimburse us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3494.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been around a long time, as most of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3497.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people think too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3498.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But nevertheless, I've seen a lot of budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3502.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you get hung up on any one item,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3506.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not helping because the budget is much bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3509.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to be able to look at the budget in its totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3513.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can express your displeasure or your concern about an item or a particular thing, but you don't want to not vote for the things that you do care about, supplies for the kids, teachers, materials, all the kinds of things, services that kids need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3530.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, if you have an objection to a particular item, express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3536.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But don't not vote for the whole budget, because the budget probably has many things in it that you do want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3542.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really something to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3544.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can come out and say what you don't like, but you certainly want to support all the resources, $60 million worth of resources going to young people and families in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3558.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way you've got to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3559.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's the way I have to look at it every year, because there are many things that I would like to put in the budget that I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3565.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, if I had, you know, an unlimited checkbook, you'd be a lot more things in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3570.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one ever does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3572.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, today, you should know that the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled against the Fair Share Amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3578.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the million dollars tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3580.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's 1.9 to 2 billion dollars worth of lost revenue that the Commonwealth will not... And the legislature is going to have to struggle, and the governor is going to have to struggle with how they are going to fund things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3594.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The discussion of the foundation budget is rife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3597.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the offsets are rife, circuit breaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3599.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3601.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where are the resources going to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3603.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no one, whether it's the state level or our level, gets to fund everything they believe should be in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3612.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would just suggest that if there's a particular item that you feel needs more attention going forward, you express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3622.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But don't withhold your support for a whole budget, because you're basically saying the other things aren't worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3628.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course they're worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3630.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of things are worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4418.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna share this with our assistant superintendent for finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4422.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4424.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She did all the work in getting it together and out to, with Schaub and working together to get the stuff in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4431.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we got back exactly what we expected to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4437.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because that's what we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4439.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think what's really significant beyond the work in here is the kinds of things that Lesley College is willing to do with us, and this is only the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4450.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some really productive discussions, they'll continue, and you know, Maurice has been involved and will continue to get more people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=110.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=112.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=120.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=122.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=125.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=141.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=149.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=152.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=153.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=154.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=158.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably, what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=160.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=165.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=169.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1890.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there is none?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1891.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have a full minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1895.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1934.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5176.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5188.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5192.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5194.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5209.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5212.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5229.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tie her up every day so I mean so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5235.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5236.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll give me a feedback as well and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6620.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6623.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6627.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6629.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6632.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6634.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6637.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6641.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6647.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6648.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6652.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6655.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6664.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6668.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6675.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6677.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6682.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6685.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6687.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6695.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6698.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6701.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of tradeoffs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6702.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6708.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6709.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6753.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6761.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6917.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6921.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6933.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6937.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6940.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6941.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6942.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6944.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6953.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6961.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6967.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6971.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6974.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7120.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7123.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7125.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a sense of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7624.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7627.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of the plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7641.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7644.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7647.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7664.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7669.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7675.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7680.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7695.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7702.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7706.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7708.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week posting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7711.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7722.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7731.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7740.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7751.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In other words, saying they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7757.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7758.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7764.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7769.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7779.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7784.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7791.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7801.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7804.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7812.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7821.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7843.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7845.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7849.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7865.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7871.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7885.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7888.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, that like all these universities would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7931.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work, based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7940.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7945.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7958.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7961.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7963.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7969.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7978.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't see us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7979.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8002.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8013.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8016.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8018.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because essentially they can work on it and we can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8026.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8028.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8029.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8049.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8059.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8061.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8062.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8067.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8072.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8075.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8086.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8087.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8090.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go over very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8092.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8097.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8111.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, that's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8117.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8118.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8152.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8155.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8161.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8165.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards, okay, which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8172.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8174.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8222.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8223.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8225.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8233.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8237.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8242.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9073.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9075.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9080.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9085.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9091.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9095.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9103.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9105.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9107.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9115.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9118.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people, perhaps, to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9128.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9132.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9137.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9142.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9143.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9145.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9150.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9154.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During the course of the year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9156.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other, and because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9165.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9168.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9170.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9171.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9177.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one, because they go with their friends, because that's one of the biggest reasons why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9186.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9189.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9193.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9198.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9208.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9212.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send them might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9223.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9227.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9229.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9231.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9234.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9236.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9238.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9242.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9250.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're gonna make a decision because we gotta get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9252.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9294.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9297.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9304.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9306.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9423.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9426.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9429.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9431.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9439.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9444.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that this won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9450.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9453.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9464.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9468.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9545.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9547.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9548.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9550.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9552.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9554.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9556.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9560.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9565.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9571.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9577.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10224.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10234.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10237.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10241.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10244.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10256.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10265.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10273.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10275.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10279.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10286.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10331.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10335.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins, and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10338.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10340.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not going to change the balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10341.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10342.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10344.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10636.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10638.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10642.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10649.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10652.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10656.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10660.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11574.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11589.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11591.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11593.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11595.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11596.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11597.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11602.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for effects to the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11613.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11615.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11622.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11623.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11735.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can, under community participation, provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11742.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11746.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11752.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=110.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=113.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical Chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=120.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=122.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=125.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=141.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=149.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=152.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=153.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=154.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=158.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=159.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=163.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Six or seven at minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=165.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=169.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1885.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We haven't approved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1889.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the report you put in the wrong place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1892.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1893.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only question is, is he?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1897.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1898.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only question was they passed on a 7-0 for just a vote, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1934.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5176.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5188.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5192.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5195.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5209.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5212.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5219.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give us feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5228.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schedule, I can't tie her up every day, so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with, we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then she'll give me her feedback as well, and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6620.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6623.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6627.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6629.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6632.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6634.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6637.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6639.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6641.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6647.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6648.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6652.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6655.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6664.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6668.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6675.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6677.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6682.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6685.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6687.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6695.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6698.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6701.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of trade-offs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6702.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6708.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6709.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6754.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if- Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood, but things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6917.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6921.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6933.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6937.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6940.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6941.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6942.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6944.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6953.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6961.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6967.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6971.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6974.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7120.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Paul, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7123.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7624.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7627.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of your plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7641.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7644.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7647.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7664.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7669.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7675.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7679.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals, for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7695.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7702.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7706.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7708.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week hosting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7711.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7722.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7731.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7740.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7751.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7757.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7758.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7764.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7769.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7779.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7784.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7791.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7801.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7804.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7812.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7821.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7843.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7845.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7849.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7863.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or... Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use... Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7885.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7888.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, like all these universities, they seem to think they have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7931.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7934.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7940.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7945.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7958.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of so many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7963.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7969.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7977.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't see us, the benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8002.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of, you know, bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8012.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8016.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better because essentially they can work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8020.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8026.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8028.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8029.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8049.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8059.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8061.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8062.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8067.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8072.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8075.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8086.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8087.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8091.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go over it very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8092.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8098.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8111.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, let's be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8117.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8118.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8152.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8155.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8161.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8164.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8165.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8172.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8174.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8176.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8222.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8224.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8225.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8233.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8237.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8242.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9073.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9075.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9080.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9085.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9091.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9095.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9103.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9105.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9107.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9115.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9118.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people perhaps to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9128.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9132.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9135.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The McGlynn Elementary is a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9137.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9142.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9143.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9145.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9149.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9154.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During the course of the year, we have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9163.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9165.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9168.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9170.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9171.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9177.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9182.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9183.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's one of the biggest reasons why people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9189.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9193.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9198.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9208.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that, and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send anybody might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows, because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9223.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9227.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9229.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9231.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9233.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9236.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9238.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9242.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9250.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to make a decision because we've got to get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9252.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9290.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9291.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9294.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9296.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9297.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9304.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9306.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9310.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to happen, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9311.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9423.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9426.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9429.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9431.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9439.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9444.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9449.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9450.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9452.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9464.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9468.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9547.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9548.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9550.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9552.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9554.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9556.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9560.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9565.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9571.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9577.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10224.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10234.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10237.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10241.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10244.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10252.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10256.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10265.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10273.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10275.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10279.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10286.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10331.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10334.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10338.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10340.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: change the balance, but you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10342.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10344.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10636.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10637.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10641.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, and you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10649.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15, and then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10656.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11574.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11589.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11591.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11593.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11595.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11596.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11597.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11602.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for, you know, affects the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11613.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11615.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11622.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11735.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can under community participation provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11742.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11746.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11752.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3624.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3640.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time in my role,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3642.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3645.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3647.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm supposed to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3649.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3651.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3658.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3664.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3666.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3672.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, a police investigation is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3675.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3685.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3689.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of those gaps do raise questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3692.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3699.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3704.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3712.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief, appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4191.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to continue for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4193.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4200.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that I thought was responsible for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4203.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took the blame myself, even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4215.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I took the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4217.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4229.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned, to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4248.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My goal was to aid the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4252.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4259.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I didn't go there with a lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4261.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't ask for any representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4263.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4270.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4277.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4280.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4285.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, as I look out, because I've been around a little while,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4289.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've probably hired most of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4291.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably was the person who signed your employment letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4296.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4302.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some differences this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4304.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4306.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't brand new this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4309.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4317.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to make a difference, and it's going to work out just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4322.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4324.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4328.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a person with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6945.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6952.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6958.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She met with us before she toured our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6962.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6978.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a number of open positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6981.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6993.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if in fact they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6998.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7005.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have after school programs, a director of early childhood is leaving, they run the after school programs, they oversee the family network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7013.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All these things have to be taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7016.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7017.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the mayor and I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7027.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7033.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These major administrative positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7036.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you get a chance to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7038.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that Dr. Edouard-Vincent will have every opportunity to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7042.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we stop our business right now, in July,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7047.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7056.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not a desirable outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7058.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7064.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7070.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7072.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want to drop that on your new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7075.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7079.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that Dr. Edouard-Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7085.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7087.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to finish strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7089.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7101.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7104.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7106.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7110.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to work it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7113.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7125.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7132.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is gonna have an awful lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7134.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7143.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7148.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7161.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7167.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7170.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that she will be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7172.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7188.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7191.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to assure you that that's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7194.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's finish strong together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7196.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a good balanced budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7198.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's put a budget together next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7200.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7210.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7264.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7268.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is that this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7272.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7275.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community doesn't need me to help,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7278.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7283.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly won't be a trucee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7285.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7293.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm a phone call away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7294.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I live down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7296.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7300.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been superintendent and been in this school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7308.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7310.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't intend to reject my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7313.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't intend to walk away from my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7316.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7325.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But will I be helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7327.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7328.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7332.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to progress and do well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7336.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8469.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quick summary is that under school choice, people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8477.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8482.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8487.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8492.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just doesn't work under the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8495.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8500.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not our situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8503.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to notify the state by a certain date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9255.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9258.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you take the next two weeks, remember the principal who we are all talking about a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9264.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: who needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9266.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations, but we've had discussions and, you know, I think over the next several days we'll get an answer, that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9278.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second piece is that, we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9285.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9293.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9301.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and have their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9313.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a suggestion, over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9318.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9320.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go over the principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9323.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: make a serious effort, but at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you gotta act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9329.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You gotta act because we gotta get in the business of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9331.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to, you know, there's things to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9333.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9336.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we don't need a one for one at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9339.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to be exactly even, but they have to be close enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9343.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be within 15, 20 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9346.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9458.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9460.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lubbock Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9463.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9468.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9476.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9480.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's four or five things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9483.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9488.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9493.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9500.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have, you know, emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseum, no offense, about a person here and a person there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9510.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9514.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9518.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to send some other people unhappy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9520.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9521.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9525.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9527.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9531.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9549.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9553.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9822.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10674.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10687.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10705.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game at Beverly High School this fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10715.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10726.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10729.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10732.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but other sports do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10734.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This includes soccer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10736.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10744.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10748.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10757.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10768.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10775.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10787.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10794.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10798.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10805.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10813.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10814.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10818.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10824.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10895.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10901.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10904.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10909.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10912.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10915.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10919.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10920.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10923.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10932.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to take youngsters out of games and not just listen to the kids saying, I want to go back in, I want to go back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10938.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10944.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10948.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a higher likelihood of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10951.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10954.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10959.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we intensify our coaches training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10962.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10972.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10977.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11018.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So typically the home team provides the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11022.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11026.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11030.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11045.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11050.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can go a long way with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11051.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11059.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11061.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ambulance is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11062.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11064.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11077.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11083.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did she already have it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, because I gave it to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11245.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11298.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11303.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11307.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11308.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11314.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11322.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just too extensive, but we can work that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11327.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11330.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not low level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11333.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that their proximity to us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11337.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11347.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11359.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11365.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that will not interfere with our otherwise operations and will help us upgrade our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11371.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11372.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to move forward because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us and they've got a short window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11382.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13565.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13577.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13585.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3624.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, that the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3640.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time in my role,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3642.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3645.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3647.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm supposed to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3649.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3651.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3658.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3664.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3666.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3672.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, a police investigation is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3675.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3685.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3688.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of those gaps do raise questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3691.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3699.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3704.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=3712.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief, appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4191.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to continue for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4193.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the Chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else that I thought was responsible for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4203.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took the blame myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4206.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4215.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I took the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4217.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4229.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4236.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4248.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My goal was to aid the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4252.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs, but I didn't go there with a lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4261.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't ask for any representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4263.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4269.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4277.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4280.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4285.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, as I look out, as I've been around a little while, I've probably hired most of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4291.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: probably was the person who signed your employment letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4296.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4302.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some differences this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4304.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4306.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't brand new this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4309.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it, we're gonna make a difference and it's gonna work out just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4322.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4324.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4326.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4331.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4331.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a person with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6945.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6952.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6958.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She met with us before she toured our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6962.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6978.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a number of open positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6981.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6992.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if, in fact, they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6998.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7005.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7007.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A director of early childhood is leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7009.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They run the after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7011.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They oversee the family network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7013.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All these things have to be taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7016.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7019.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7027.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7033.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These major administrative positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7036.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you get a chance to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7038.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that Dr. Edouard-Vincent will have every opportunity to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7042.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we stop our business right now, in July,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7047.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7055.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not a desirable outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7058.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7064.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7070.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7072.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want to drop that on your new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7075.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7079.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that Dr. Edouard-Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7085.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7087.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to finish strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7089.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7101.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7104.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7106.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7110.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to work it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7113.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7125.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7132.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is gonna have an awful lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7134.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7143.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7148.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7161.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7167.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7170.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that she will be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7172.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7188.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7191.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to assure you that that's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7194.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's finish strong together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7196.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a good balanced budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7198.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's put a budget together next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7200.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7210.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7264.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7268.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is that this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7272.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7275.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community doesn't need me to help,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7278.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7283.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly won't be intrusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7285.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7293.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm a phone call away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7294.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I live down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7296.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7300.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been superintendent and been in the school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7308.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7310.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't intend to reject my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7313.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't intend to walk away from my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7316.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7325.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But will I be helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7326.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7328.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7332.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to progress and do well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7336.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8469.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: quick summary is that under school choice people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8477.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8482.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us, and we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8492.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just doesn't work under the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8495.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8500.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not our situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8503.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to notify the state by a certain date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9255.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9257.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we take the next two weeks, remember the principal, who we are all talking about a little bit, needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9266.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9271.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've had discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9272.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think over the next several days, we'll get an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9276.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9278.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second piece is that we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9285.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9293.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9301.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and if their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9313.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9315.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9318.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9320.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go over the principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9323.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We make a serious effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9325.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you've got to act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9329.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to act, because we've got to get in the business of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9331.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's things to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9333.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9336.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we don't need a one for one at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9339.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to be exactly even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9342.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they have to be close enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9345.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: within 15, 20 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9345.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9458.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9460.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lumbergoyne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9463.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9468.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9476.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9480.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's four or five things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9483.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9488.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9493.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9500.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseam, no offense, about a person here and a person there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9510.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9514.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn, it's going to send some other people unhappy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9520.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9521.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9525.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9527.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9531.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9549.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9553.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9556.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9556.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9560.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10674.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10687.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10705.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game with Beverly High School this fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10715.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10726.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10729.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10732.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but other sports do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10734.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This includes soccer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10736.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10744.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10748.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10757.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10768.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10775.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10787.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10794.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10798.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10805.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10813.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10814.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10818.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10824.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10895.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10901.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10904.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10909.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10912.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10915.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10919.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10920.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10923.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10932.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to take youngsters out of games and not, you just listen to the kids saying, I wanna go back in, I wanna go back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10938.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10944.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10948.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a higher likelihood of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10951.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10954.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10959.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we intensify our coaches training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10962.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10972.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10977.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11018.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So typically the home team provides the trainer, but on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11026.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11030.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11045.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11050.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can go a long way with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11051.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11059.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11061.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ambulance is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11062.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11073.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: all kinds of injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11078.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11083.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11096.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She already has it now, because I gave it to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11245.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11298.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11303.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11307.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11308.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11314.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11322.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just too extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11324.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can work that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11327.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11330.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not low level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11333.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that their proximity to us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11337.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11347.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11359.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective and that will not interfere<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11367.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with our otherwise operations, and will help us upgrade our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11371.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11372.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to move forward, because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again, because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us, and they've got a short window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11382.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13565.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13573.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I mean because you can't mix those kids in as easily as you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13577.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13586.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=137.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have an answer for you very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=279.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was that Empower program where they were having kids do more things to help the kids who were not doing as well to get some additional assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=624.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Want to answer that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=625.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=626.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bistro 489 is well on its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=628.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few more things that have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=630.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some parts that were not immediately available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=634.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're also adjusting the bathroom for security reasons so you can go directly from the bistro into the bathroom rather than going into the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=643.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There have been a couple of events up there, but we're very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=647.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that this Friday, I want to make a tentative announcement, but this Friday prior to the marathon,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=655.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Crystal Campbell Foundation will probably have some event there Friday morning, and I'll give you information about that tomorrow when I get that straightened away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=664.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's operational to a degree, but full operation probably another week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1067.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So our intent is to take each one of these items, do a cost analysis, and do a feasibility analysis for you, and perhaps in some instances provide an alternative where the cost may be excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1081.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of these things are, you know, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1084.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The duplicative and the initial fronts, you know, tap cards are very, very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1089.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're talking extraordinary amounts of money for that, to do that, all the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1093.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the metal strip is very inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1096.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have to ask the question which one of these two could be done quickly and, you know, efficiently and provide the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1104.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also want to be careful who you give keys to, don't give keys to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1111.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and give you an analysis and a cost factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1114.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of it will go to budget, like Councilors and things of that type, and some of it will come to you over the next two months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1211.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would give you an idea of what it would take to put something in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1214.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So something that would take construction, obviously would take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1218.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something that could be done just simply by adding it, wouldn't take very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1222.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then it would be a process of, you might say this is a two month project, when it's approved, if it's approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1230.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1240.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to use them too because the other factor is is that it's nice to have a tool But if you don't know how to put it on or apply it properly, it doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1342.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, as a result of all this activity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1344.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we are spending an exceptional amount of money on additional personnel for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1350.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've already spending in excess of $3,000 a week over and above what we budgeted for just security monitors in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1359.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you cover every door, you just keep adding to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1364.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got a person at the door 31, which is down towards the physical education section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1372.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got somebody in the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1374.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be very important for us to try to figure out what's the balance between covering every door and how much money we're going to spend, because it's not sustainable in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1383.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think, you know, let us talk about that and come back to you with a report, because I think it's really a mistake to just simply putting people at every door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1390.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd get ourselves in a situation where it's expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1400.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a monitor in the front door of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1403.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a monitor at door 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1404.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the pool door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1406.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is the vocational door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1408.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody you add costs money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1410.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1412.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to decide how much we're going to put out there at this point in time and where it's going to go, because you're raising the cost of security substantially at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1423.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these things weren't budgeted at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1433.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a secretary doing the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1436.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's, there's an issue with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1439.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1440.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk about, I mean, look, it's, it's, it's money that you want to spend, we'll spend it, but you've got to understand that every possible door in this place, if it has a security monitor, you're going to keep raising the, the level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1566.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a choice we have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1568.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've heard people advocate strongly for the pool door to be covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1573.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've heard people advocate for people coming through one point of entry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1579.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It never was a monitor at that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1581.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was only the buzzer system and the rapture system inside the vocational school office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1587.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That would be new to put someone at that door specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1590.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can do whatever you think is in best interest, but if we keep adding layers and layers of people, we're going to have to assume that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1598.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1708.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can assess the flow during certain times of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1712.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly in the morning, there are people using the pool facility and other things of that type down that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1718.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other times of day, people do come through there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1721.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but there are people coming through the vocational entrance or wanting to come through the vocational entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1725.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are going to be people wanting to come through the bistro entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1728.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people wanting to go to make way for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1730.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people going to go to a lot of different entry points because it's more efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1735.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty for us is to determine, you know, which is the most necessary and how much we're willing to spend on having people in that category or how much we're willing to rely on the cameras and the Raptor system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1749.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the buzzer systems to be the most, let's say, likely form of check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1763.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There aren't motion detectors coming in those doors, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1765.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are motion detectors going in some of the rooms that trigger the lighting, but not the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1772.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you go in the vocational office, there is a whole panorama, as you know, of cameras, of television screens, that you can see every door coming into the book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1783.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So theoretically, a person sitting at a desk, if someone coming to the door, could recognize a person, just like they do at an elementary school in many ways, and let them in and tell them to come to the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1796.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, it's an issue of how much we're prepared to do for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1815.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can certainly ask to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1816.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, they're doing other things and getting out of the movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1820.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are certain times of the day when movement through there is more likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1842.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 43 doors in the high school, all the doors would be open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2652.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2718.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the two days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2897.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe I can just add a little clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2899.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that you're looking at a half year thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2901.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You said December 31st, but you're really looking at half year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2904.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The half year, believe it or not, is not December 31st because teachers are generally on a 10 month year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2911.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't you say the half year whenever that falls, the next meeting, and then at the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2918.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2918.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you'll get a full picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2965.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2965.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking for a payroll report, if it's the mid-year, you'll get the payroll report that falls at the mid-year, typically the end of January, beginning of February, typically is the mid-year for the teachers and everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2976.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the bulk of the payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2978.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other report, you'll get a payroll, maybe the last payroll of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2984.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you'll see the, you know, all the payments that are made at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2988.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, because of the way we're, it's kind of interesting, because of the way we're, we deal with faculty and others, they get a balloon payment at the end of the year because we defer payments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2999.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But some of the negotiation requests, which we'll talk about later, could alter some of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3005.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a little tricky at this point in time, but I'm sure we can provide something that would give you a sufficient look at who's getting paid and what they're getting paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3015.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you need to be careful how you try to translate it across the lines because it doesn't add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3021.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just times this, times that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3024.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you just want to be careful that you don't try to infer things from it because it may not be exactly the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3031.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each person's payroll may be slightly different because of the type of contract they're on and the type of payout that they get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3047.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Usually it's an alpha listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3049.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An alpha listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3100.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you get a good picture of things, and obviously you'd see everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3829.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a person makes a complaint or brings it to the attention of the principal, if you look at the back of this thing, there are forms that a person needs to fill out and follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3839.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they don't bring it to our attention, we may not know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3842.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you do, we'd have a record of this forum and a resolution on what was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3847.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's pretty extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3850.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, every year when the administrators come back from the summer and they get ready for the year, part of our orientation is to go over these materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3861.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do go over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3862.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, it's building base to go over them with your people in the building to make sure that they are familiar and that they're willing to use these things when it's brought to their attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3872.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The incidence of cyberbullying has been out there for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3876.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And social media, as you might imagine,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3880.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difficult because people are constantly commenting to each other and sometimes you're not sure when someone's aggravating a friend or they're actually bullying them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3893.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to do more with that because it's very difficult to control that because it's so personalized by people calling each other up and doing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3902.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think people are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3904.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think sometimes it doesn't hurt to refresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3907.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt to go back over it again, make a bigger issue out of it, maybe hold a couple of forums on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3913.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly it's a shared responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3916.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School alone can't stop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3918.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents have to be aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3920.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students have to be aware of it and report it when it's happening to them, especially the older ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3925.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to make it a shared responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3928.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3930.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the important thing is that if it is reported to us that it's properly followed, we follow up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3937.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people are brought in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3939.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are consequences, we deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3941.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other factor is that we file discipline reports with the state every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3946.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there was a situation where a person did something that rose to the level of requiring discipline, that would be part of the filing with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3954.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's one of the categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4258.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, they're generally handled by them unless it's going to something more serious and reaches a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4263.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Mr. Johnson's here, maybe he can give us a quick snapshot of what happens at the Roberts since Cheryl was here about the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4298.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Johnson's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4298.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe he can give us a snapshot as to his experience with the Robertsons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4812.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the sleeping dog in the room is the fact that social media also brings out the worst in parents and citizens who bully each other on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4824.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you don't have to go very far on social media to find out that adults are pounding each other on a regular basis, and they're certainly setting bad role models for their young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4834.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a bigger issue than schools, because social media has provided a forum for adults to insult each other on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4844.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've seen it on recent months and weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4847.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just people saying things that are really horrific, and then you expect kids not to do the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4853.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4854.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a bigger issue than just the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4856.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really something that has to come into the community and people have to say, social media provides opportunity, but it also provides a downside if it's not used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4866.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The lack of civility that seems to exist in these days is quite apparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4872.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do something about that because we are the role models for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4877.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4878.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: using that role model particularly well, what do you expect the young people to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4882.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll do exactly the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4977.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call on our assistant superintendent to read this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5808.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5809.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to point something out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5810.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As these reports come up, these reports are really great transition reports for my successor because they talk about what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5818.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They talk about what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5820.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just so you're aware, these are the kinds of reports that I would forward to the person you select going forward so they can actually see what the departments are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5830.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as they come in, so put them over because it also may inform questions you may want to ask as you continue to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5839.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because these are the kinds of things that are really specific to the school that a person coming in might not know off the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5847.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I just want to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5848.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, Nicole did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7164.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So normally you would take the recommendation of these experts in the field, your department heads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7171.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: unless you had such a severe difference of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7178.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, they're working every day with the teachers, they're working in the classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7182.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Science is a hands-on learning experience, and that's experimentation and inquiry is the heart of science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7189.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the great criticism of a lot of the standardized tests that our young people have to take is that they're paper and pencil, and they're not inquiry-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7200.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fact that the elementary program is going to become much more inquiry-based and much more hands-on should be a plus in everyone's mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7209.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty has always been getting publishers to do that because it requires a lot more work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7214.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It requires a lot more planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7216.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what they've always tried to do is just simply give us something and say, we've covered the material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7222.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From what I can see, dealing with Rocco and the science faculty so far, is that hands-on is the way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7230.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And right now, the premier program, as Rocco has identified, is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7235.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would not want you to move away from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7238.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the decision is ultimately yours, because we make a recommendation, and you either accept or reject our recommendations for curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7807.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7809.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a quick comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7810.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rocco's done a terrific job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7811.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can tell how thorough it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7814.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're very pleased to have him in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7819.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of good people in these roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7821.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of good people in Rocco and, you know, and... Nicole, Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7829.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, you know, both did a great job in Tony World, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7832.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this forms the basis for succession and transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7837.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to see this, because when you're listening to interviews, sometimes people don't know all the things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7842.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, I bet you the person interviewing the other night probably didn't remember half, didn't know half these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7848.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7849.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's quite a bit going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7851.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And talk about partnerships, they're all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7854.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just keep that in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7855.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you go through these things, keep this in mind that a lot of people are doing some terrific things that the next superintendent will inherit and build on, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7867.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just important to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8374.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have several people that have known, told us they're retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8377.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other people who haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8381.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: made it formal yet and yet there are other people who don't want to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8384.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if they've made it formal and they've told us, we'll give you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8389.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they haven't, we may suspect it, but I can't, I'm not going to preempt anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8426.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8433.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's up to the mayor and the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8435.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8618.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the same thing, I've given you an updated report from early childhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8624.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which Diane and I worked with Shelly Gross earlier today to go over details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8630.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you've got some numbers and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8633.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in a nutshell, essentially, it really depends on what is the number of people at each school that want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8642.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also depends on the ability to us to retain qualified staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8650.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to create the right space arrangements and have some predictability, because in most instances, these are second jobs for people that are a few hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8661.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we need qualified staff to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8663.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have some challenges with regard to who is in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8667.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some cases, we're open to everybody, but if in fact a student has need based on special needs, based on other kinds of things that may require some additional assistance that may be different, it's professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8684.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's program development in order to make the programs attractive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8689.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we recognize that at two schools, the Brooks and the Columbus, the demand is growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8694.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we're beginning to work very hard to expand it so we can accommodate those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8700.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against doing it, but it's very important to make sure that we can service people effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8705.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if you can't get the right staff and you can't get the right setup,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8709.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you don't want to open the door and then have the wrong numbers, because there are quotas based on early education and care rules that we have to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8719.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we believe we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8723.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got some numbers in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8724.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got some staffing patterns in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8727.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll keep you informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8729.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's premature until we get a little bit more to actually tell you what you will and won't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8738.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a need to plan this out a little bit in each school and make sure the demand is there, and make sure the staffing can be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8745.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's reasonable to assume that we won't be able to accommodate anybody that wants it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8769.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8770.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, or all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8772.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, at the Brooks, there's probably going to get up to 150.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8775.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8776.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and like the Columbus will grow slightly, but it'll grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8780.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other places appear to be fairly stable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8790.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's still coming, though, because, you know, it's obviously people are starting to say, well, what am I going to do in the fall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8795.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other people are saying, well, I don't need that anymore because I'm doing something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8800.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's fluid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8802.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can project that at the Brooks, the numbers are going to be very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8806.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the Columbus, they're growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8808.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the Roberts and the McGlynn, they seem to be stable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8811.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8812.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8851.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we originally planned these programs, we looked to outsource them at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8857.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We found that the reliability of the outsourcing was not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8861.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that they had the same issues in getting people and getting people trained the way we wanted them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8868.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also recognized that their costs were much higher and we would have to transmit that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8874.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can control costs a lot better by keeping it inside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8876.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The real issue is to take a look at the staffing, to make it attractive, what kind of incentives can we give to employees who are only working four hours a day or five hours a day to stay with us and to be trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8892.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to go on from there, because that's really the trick, to get them to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8897.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8900.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come up with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8900.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done pretty well so far, just that it is a difficult thing when people are working four or five hours and they want to get another job, or they can get something that pays a little better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8910.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide, you know, how much we're willing to pay based on what we're willing to charge as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8918.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also a revenue source for the school district, which offsets the cost of other things you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8930.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll certainly give you another report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8931.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get you another report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8933.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whether we have all the answers by June, I don't know, but we certainly will give you another report, because a lot of recruitment takes place over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8941.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as people are looking for employment or making decisions about what they will do in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8969.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I put two papers in your folder, didn't put them on the agenda because they're really just informational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8975.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report on the last day of school, which is June 20th right now based on the fact that we're not going to have another snow day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8982.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then a little bit of information on the student walkout, because it's been a little while since, I feel like, you know, just enough to give you information on what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8990.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8991.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=17.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=23.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people in the community who obviously were concerned, and so I respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=28.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a certain element of people that have certain political agendas, and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=33.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll move forward, and in time, everything will heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1817.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1824.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, a decision was made that people don't agree with, but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community, and that never was my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1838.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm confident that Medford has a bright future for its school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1843.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a lot of good things in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1845.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a terrific faculty, terrific administrators, wonderful supporters, people that have worked hard to partner with our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1853.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that we will get a lot done in the next several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1857.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that the new administration coming in will come and build on a firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1863.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor's words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1864.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the reality for all of us is to get beyond, to work to learn from this situation, and to grow together, and to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the children and families of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1877.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, we will work much more closely with the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1881.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1883.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was an exception, but I have a lot of confidence in our police department and Chief Sacco and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1889.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make sure that everyone realizes that we will do everything we can to keep our young people safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1894.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1896.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your support and I appreciate your understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1899.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=62.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, naturally, you know, I wouldn't like my career to end this way, but it's, you know, but I think that we've still been able to do a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=70.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, this is 50 years, 23 as superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=95.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A decision was made that people don't agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=100.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community and that's never was my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=599.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1181.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President Roy Bellson, superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1185.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1189.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1192.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Historically, the chief of police and the school system have worked very closely together on all security matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1201.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1999, when Columbine hit, the chief and I were part of a group that formed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1208.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the STARS program, School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1213.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was part of NMLEC, the Northeast Middlesex Law Enforcement Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1217.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since that time, we've worked very closely together to put together all kinds of security measures for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1225.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we communicate very regularly with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1229.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we think there's a danger, we talk and we take action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1236.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Recently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1238.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Back in and around December 28th or 29th, I'm not 100% sure of that date, a cleaning service that's employed by the public schools at the McGlynn Complex, middle school and elementary, found in the rear of the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, in the back row under a seat, a magazine clip that contained some ammunition in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1266.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is unclear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1268.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: how much ammunition was in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1270.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that it could have been, based on the chief's estimate, at least three to four rounds, but not necessarily a full clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1279.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't tell that because we don't have the magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1282.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from the picture that we were able to see, that's a reasonable estimate at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1291.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cleaning service turned it over to a custodian at the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1295.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The custodian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1297.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: brought the magazine clip to the principal's office at the McGlynn Middle, and put it on a shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1305.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the report that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1308.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1323.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1326.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School went on Christmas break on the 22nd of December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1335.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To the best of our knowledge, at least at this point, we're checking on a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1340.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Only one entity used the McGlynn during that weekend for a holiday service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1350.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cleaning service has informed us that they did a thorough cleaning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1356.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the facility, including the auditorium, which they would typically do on Fridays, and found nothing at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1367.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The service was over sometime on Sunday, and the holiday commenced on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1376.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometime around the 28th, the cleaning service went back into the theater, or the 29th, I'm not 100% sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1386.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and they found under the seat in the back row this magazine clip that I just described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1394.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was turned over to the custodian, in-house custodian, whose name is Daniel Tully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1400.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Tully took that magazine clip, according to his report, and put it in the principal's office, Mr. Edwards' office, and he said on the shelf, along with some other things that were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1416.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Edwards has told us that he came into his office in and around the 30th of December to do some work and to do some cleaning, at which point he alleges that he cleared away some things that were unnecessary and may have, he doesn't know, may have discarded the magazine clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1458.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1465.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you have other stories, I'll be happy to listen to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1468.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm telling you my latest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1476.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1477.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I had a different story, I would say that also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1480.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1483.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand, but you have more information than I have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1488.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Edwards told me that he cleaned his office and he may have discarded the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1500.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you know what a magazine clip looks like, it's about this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1505.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's black.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1508.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Has some appearances that looks like it could be a small cell phone, small remote control, small other electronic device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1530.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know what other items he had there and how it could have been confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1535.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the story that he provided to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1539.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did not have any evidence of a magazine clip available to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1547.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometime in early January, Mr. Tully came to my office during his shift and told me about what he had found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1559.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him routine questions about where he found it, who was there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1565.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1568.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he couldn't really fill in much more except the fact that he found it and put that in Mr. Edwards' office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1575.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We checked with different other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1578.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at this point in time, I'm unable to identify where the chain of custody took place after Mr. Edwards allegedly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1594.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: discarded the item, or did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1597.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, subsequent to that, we try to make some decision as to whether we felt this rose to the level of a reportable incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1611.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm told that Officer Ricciardi, who is the school resource officer, was also told at some point in early January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1620.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1622.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to be sure that I'm not 100% sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1627.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the time, we felt that it was an isolated incident, that it was something that was not dangerous in the sense because it wasn't a firearm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1641.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bullets don't fire themselves, not a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1644.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No weapon was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1652.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we should take our time and not raise anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1658.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, subsequent to that, in conversations that I've had with people in recent times, indicates to me that even though we did not feel it presented a clear danger, that other people do, and that they would have preferred that we made a full report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1682.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the chief of police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1684.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated earlier, the chief and I talk all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1688.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no problem telling the chief anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1691.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've talked about a lot of difficult situations over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1695.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't hide things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1697.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a judgment was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1699.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that judgment said, we don't see this as dangerous at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1706.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So therefore, I take responsibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1711.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for not reporting it to the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1714.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I did so, I believe, in good conscience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1719.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that it was something that I needed to know more about before I raised it or elevated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1730.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years, I have reported any number of things the chief can verify to him that I thought were dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1737.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe that Mr. Edwards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1742.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would have any motive for not turning it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1746.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: After all, he wasn't there on the weekend, didn't belong to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1752.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He has turned in many items, and Officer Ricciardi has indicated this, to him on multiple occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1760.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't believe he had any reason not to turn it in if he knew he had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1765.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, since it has become an issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1771.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially in light of what's taken place in other communities around the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1777.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have authorized a full sweep today, full sweep of the McGlynn Complex, which was conducted by Medford Police, Somerville Police, Everett Police, and Arlington Police with dogs that are weapons and drug trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1796.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we found no trace of weapons, ammunition, or drugs in the complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1802.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm comfortable that that building is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1807.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have also initiated, in order to help the public feel comfortable, a sweep of all school buildings over the next few days to ensure that there is nothing there that would be of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1825.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are also planning this week to put together material, media, and others to talk to the public about the nature of school security, what we have in place, without getting into sensitive items, but what we have in place, and also to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1844.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have communicated with the Teachers Association President, Charlene Douglas, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1851.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's possible that I will meet with the McGlynn faculty on Monday afternoon to answer any questions they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1858.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that our schools are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1861.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that we do more than most school systems do to keep our schools safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1867.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that we will continue to review and upgrade what we have if we find that there is room here to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1880.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we believe that we can go forward recognizing that the decision that I made with others in my employee needs to be upgraded in the future and that a lesson learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1899.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1905.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1914.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, the chief of police was not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1917.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1918.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to the custodian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1920.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to a couple of other people that I work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1924.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, at that particular point in time, Officer Ricciardi did come in at some point, came to the conclusion that it was not something that warranted a full investigation at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1967.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I saw the picture last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1972.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the clip is, if you look at the clip, you can see one bullet at the top, and then there are holes on the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1981.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chief can describe this better than I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1984.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he can tell how many rounds might be in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1988.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the person's hand covered most of it, holding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1993.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he couldn't tell beyond a certain point whether there were additional bullets beyond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1998.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the 3 to 4 that he was able to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2033.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have notified people on all kinds of situations in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2058.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reported multiple situations over the years of all kinds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2064.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you know, one can debate whether this rose to that level<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2071.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But given the consensus that I have- All due respect, there's no debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2146.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to respond to the notification issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2149.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're speaking about a couple of years ago when there was a bomb threat at the high school, the issue wasn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2157.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: notification, the issue was timing of the notification, whether it was soon enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2162.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the committee decided to make it a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2166.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We notified the public about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2168.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just didn't do it immediately afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2170.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did it a few hours later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2172.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We felt that more people would be home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2174.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the committee felt differently, and we modified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2177.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as far as this situation goes, it happened during a school vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2183.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It happened when no students were in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2186.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't happen where there was a firearm anywhere near it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2191.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was a plausible thought as to how it may have gotten there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2196.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, since that time, we're all aware of what happened in Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2201.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that there's a heightened feeling that somehow that is the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2208.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2209.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, Massachusetts has tremendous gun laws, tremendous gun laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2214.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't buy what that individual bought in Florida, in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2219.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2222.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, from my standpoint, I made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2226.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that decision, we have back and forth, and it was determined that that was the wrong decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2233.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept responsibility for it, and we'll go forward from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2239.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but I made the decision in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2241.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes, you know, we make decisions that people don't agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2245.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I thought there was something live, if I thought that students were in the building, if I thought there was a weapon anywhere near the place, my decision would have been different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2254.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I stand on that for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2256.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I apologize to anyone who may feel that I did the wrong thing, but I certainly didn't do it with malintent or reason to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2268.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: let's say obfuscate any of the information from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2273.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll stand on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2299.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why didn't I think it was necessary in January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2307.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we don't think that's the case, because the cleaning service that found it cleans that area regularly and did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2316.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clear to me that it landed there very recently in proximity to the time that it was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2395.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not gonna evaluate a principal in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2398.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2400.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will take actions on personnel matters as we go forward into the spring, but I'm not gonna evaluate a person in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2409.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2410.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an appropriate way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2412.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Individuals are entitled to due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2414.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're entitled to the protections of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2417.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the reality is that we will be reviewing personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2423.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be reviewing policies and practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2426.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be ramping up some of our drills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2428.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also told the principals that the week we come back, we're going to run a special drill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2437.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm a little concerned about it in some ways because I don't want to heighten in the students' minds that this is somehow an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2443.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But on the other hand, I think we should at least do one more drill at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2450.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might help the community understand that we're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2453.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think for the most realities of this thing, we will evaluate personnel and situations and policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2460.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee is going to meet on Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2463.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure that I'll hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2465.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: from them pretty directly about what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2468.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2471.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this judgment that I made won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2475.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2670.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Councilor, you've been on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2672.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you've received multiple phone calls or letters from me when situations have happened over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2680.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe Councilor Scarpelli, you have also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2683.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone who's on the school committee knows that it's a regular practice, and we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2689.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some things that happen in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2690.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be a kid fight, something else like that, or in the backyard, or an injury, or something like that, that you just can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2698.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: take everything that happens every day and send it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2701.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, this situation, in retrospect, was one that deserved notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2708.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the judgment that I made was not the best judgment at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2715.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2723.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants to be notified, Mr. Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2725.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2726.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2728.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on situations that are serious and I should have notified them on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2776.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2777.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just want to say that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2780.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally, I tell the chief virtually everything because we have very good communication and have for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2787.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this instance, I didn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2788.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I failed in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2790.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2792.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But typically, the school committee does want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2795.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's clear to me that I should have informed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2798.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't believe and I think this is the key point that needs to be made and needs to be heard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2805.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe our schools are unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2808.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2810.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that our children are in danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2812.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that the school committee, the council, by paying money for cameras and other things like that, have provided quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2820.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The police department has worked very closely with us, with resource officers, with all kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2825.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We work closely with the district attorney to determine what's happening on the street on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2830.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on that heads off issues in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2836.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I made a mistake this time, not if I made, I made a mistake this time, I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2842.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I believe enough's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2845.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that if we, we dedicate ourselves to it, we'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2851.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe our schools are safe as any school in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2856.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, there are no guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2859.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are no guarantees that I can give you or anyone of sound mind could give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2865.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because we live in a society that is a little violent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2868.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We live in a society that does do unusual things at times, and we do have a lot of mental health out there, and there are guns on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2876.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that requires even more, more from the people that make decisions, make decisions about these issues and these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2883.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this instance, I accept responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2910.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will put that on our calendar for Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2974.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me ask a technical question of the clerk, if I may, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2978.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted a meeting, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2980.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted it at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2982.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we make a modification if the chair agrees to make that modification under the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3031.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll communicate with your office tomorrow morning, and you can tell me whether we fall within the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3061.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3319.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3323.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of all the letters in ALICE, the only one we don't do is confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3330.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because everyone alerts people if there's something going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3334.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone locks down if they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3337.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone informs mutual aid or assistance when they do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3343.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone tries to evacuate if they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3346.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the confront part that becomes of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3350.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reason it's of concern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3353.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Think about young kids, little kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3355.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should they be trying to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3358.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are all teachers, are all staff physically able to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3363.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Will they try to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3367.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we mandate that they confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3370.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot to this that needs to be thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3372.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what age group do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3375.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3376.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an active shooter program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3377.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just a general program for bomb threats or things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3380.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3381.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3384.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that regard, who confronts and in what way, and who's able to confront, not everybody is going to be willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3394.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3396.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief and I have talked about starting maybe with the older kids and the higher grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3404.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3405.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But look, I am more than willing to have the discussion and to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3411.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an active give and take on this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3414.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need all the players who are going to be expected to step up to tell us whether they're prepared to confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3421.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the other day when the Parkland situation took place, if you remember the sequence, the individual pulled a fire alarm to get people to evacuate the setting and then was going to pick them off with his gun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3439.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've heard many times, why don't we evacuate this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3442.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've told you in previous occasions that evacuation isn't always the best drill because the explosive or the sniper could be on the outside of the building, not just on the inside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3457.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all situation-specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3460.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it needs to be talked about, more than willing to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3464.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not just put out alphabet soup, ALICE, and say that's a cure-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3469.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3471.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to get people to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3473.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's got to be adopted and committed to by the people who are going to implement it, or else it's just another training program that will go nowhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3512.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3520.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's been offered to the president of the MTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And she hasn't confirmed it yet, but she thinks it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3526.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she has to confirm it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3562.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's a police investigation, so I leave that to the Chief to answer that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3620.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: STARS was set up to look at school threats, the acronym School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3628.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when a school threat is identified,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3631.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or we believe it is identified, and we believe it requires additional resources above and beyond what we have, we would notify the STARS commanders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3642.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief Sacco once headed that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3643.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure who heads it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3647.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would notify them, and they would provide us with those resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3651.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say we needed a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3653.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They might have a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3654.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a certain type of psychiatrist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3657.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would help us with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3659.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a forensic help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3662.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are certain police departments and entities in the state that have forensic, the bomb squads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3666.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would coordinate the kind of specialized assistance that we need to make the appropriate threat assessment and then make the appropriate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3676.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we needed, unfortunately, a SWAT team, that would be the ultimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3684.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's a coordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3685.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make that point very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3687.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of people out there selling products about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3691.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: coordinating with schools and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3693.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of money being made in the school security business right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3697.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And part of it brings up the idea that we could have an uncoordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3704.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the last thing we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3706.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chief and I both agree that if we have a situation that requires mutual aid or specialized assistance, we want that coordinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3716.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may not know, but I think we will have said it many times, but maybe you don't remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3722.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are floor plans on the computers of the police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3726.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are doors that are marked that people can go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3729.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of pre-preparation in place for STARS to work and for our own police to respond strategically and specifically to areas which we believe require attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3744.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we don't want is we don't want what happened in 1992.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3747.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember 1992?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3753.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1992, there was a altercation at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3760.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at that time, people came from everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3763.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Helicopters were flying over the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3764.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People were coming in all different kinds of uniforms, not coordinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3768.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that only created more problems than it assisted in helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3773.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's very important, and I thank the chief and his comrades at NMWEC for the work that they have put in to ensure that a response of that type through the STAR system is one that is coordinated, thorough, and strategic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3798.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3799.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3800.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it occurred when students were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3803.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would have been a full report and immediate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3827.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to blame anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3831.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3832.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a relationship with the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3835.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should have made the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3843.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The next step is to continue to fortify and to continue to assess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3846.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect to be in front of you in and around March 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3849.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know you're looking forward to seeing me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3852.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Attempted humor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3856.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get funding for the upgrade to all the security cameras that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3863.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded all of them so that they're now capable to withstand some of the weather issues that previously they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3872.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have better visibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3873.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have better ability to pan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3876.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's a distinct improvement over what we've been able to have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3881.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll be in front of you for that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3892.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3893.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there are a lot of terrific groups that rent our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3895.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every group from Cub Scouts to all kinds of groups all the way up rent our schools or use our schools in a meaningful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3903.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an outlier situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3906.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not something that's happened frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3910.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we didn't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3911.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe I didn't handle it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3914.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean we should deprive the community of the resources of the schools, which I think are very important to providing appropriate recreation and assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3923.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, shut down the pool, we just did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3925.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to shut down the gymnasium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3926.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3928.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4050.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate the observation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4052.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that my conversations with certain individuals will be very direct and very thorough, and that decisions will be made about a lot of things in the next short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4130.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it was a question of coordination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4133.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not notifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4477.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4502.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4505.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from time to time, we make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4508.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what decision makers do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4510.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4511.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if I've made a decision that didn't square with everyone else, then I accept responsibility for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4518.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4519.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the chief will tell you that we have talked about some very tough items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4524.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there will be some things you don't know about because they're personal and they're caught up in legal matters that you can't know and the school committee gets advised of because it's not a public matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4533.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4535.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what's required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4537.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly on safety matters, safety matters, we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4543.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as far as people using our facilities, we can cancel every basketball game, we can cancel every hockey game, let me finish, we can cancel every game where people come in who are visiting from some other place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4557.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know, we know that in society today there are some people out there that do horrible things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4565.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can't just regulate everything that's going on all around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4570.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you don't want to rent the school properties, if you don't feel that that revenue or that communication with the public is a good one, that can be a policy discussion with the school committee guided by some input that you want to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4582.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, our schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4585.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our schools are going to be places, they've been community schools for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4589.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People have used them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4590.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people come in visiting from other communities and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4594.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, let me finish the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4596.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, the event would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4600.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4603.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we don't hide anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4606.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was a situation, it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4610.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I've said before, I'm taking responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4612.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how much more I can say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4644.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my assumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4646.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Investigation is undergoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4648.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to conclude anything until the police finish their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4652.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4666.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These buildings, when they're rented of that type, like for example, the Japanese language school has two security guards there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4671.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pay for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4676.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pay for coverage by custodians who function as security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4681.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have custodians that are now security guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4683.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are they paying a different rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4685.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They provide us with coverage in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4687.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4715.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have provided some security, have paid for some security of certain people in these large groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4719.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've mentioned the Japanese as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4721.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, not every group is paying for security, so maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4726.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4727.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5508.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. President, if I make one more comment, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5511.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've heard the word retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5514.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be no retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5515.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of legal matters pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5518.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those legal matters are being represented by legal counsel of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5525.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to indicate that somehow something is wrong because we defend ourselves in a legal setting in this public forum is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5540.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, if there was any evidence of retaliation, I would not allow it in any way, shape or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5547.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope you realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5549.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, with regard to that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5553.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are situations and decisions that are made that people don't always agree with in terms of educational assignments, programs, services, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people agree and some people disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5564.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the nature of how we plan and how we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5569.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just because there's some disagreement doesn't necessarily mean that people are at risk of losing their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5576.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People have professional status rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5577.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have all kinds of rights under their contract, all kinds of rights under the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5583.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing's going to happen that's inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5585.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we disagree with someone on an issue, that can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5589.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that happens in almost every forum and any place you go, in any operation, there may be some disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5596.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one is in jeopardy of losing their job in that regard because they spoke up or said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5603.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, I appreciate it when people speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5607.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I like it when people speak to my face directly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5611.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and call me on the phone when they've got something to say, rather than go to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5615.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5624.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5627.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there are people, Mr. President, there are people, Mr. President, who want to go and find out from the person responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5636.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are people that go around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5637.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have a problem with that in this particular point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5640.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but it does speak to the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5642.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as trust goes, it cuts two ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8679.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This committee, the whole meeting, is already been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8683.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Posted, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8684.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Location, time, and 48-hour notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8687.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you just can't change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8701.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a little easier to do, but this is our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8703.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8739.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I want to answer a couple questions that were raised during the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8743.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important that this be public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8748.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated earlier, I made the decision, whether it was right or wrong, I made that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8757.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did not inform the school committee or the mayor until Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8763.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8766.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the police chief and I talked Friday morning, directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8771.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that sequence at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8775.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8896.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Regular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=98.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just so it's clear for everyone and anyone watching on television, the focus group for the general public is Thursday, the 15th of February, two sessions, three to five and six to eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=112.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three to five, six to eight, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=115.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rules are that anyone can come up, there's no preferential order, no one gets any specific,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=121.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three to five minutes to make a statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=123.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't want to make a statement, you just want to give something written, it'll be taken by MASC and it'll be brought into the thing as if it were oral testimony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=132.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so any questions about that, anyone can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=135.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're advertised, we're out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=137.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The administrators will have an opportunity tomorrow to speak with MASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=142.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The teachers will have an opportunity later in the day tomorrow and also they can participate in the general public if they choose to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=159.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not going to be televised, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=161.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intake for the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=163.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=172.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=173.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=174.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope that we contacted you, Miranda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=177.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did you get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=177.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I got it, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=178.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=178.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So hopefully you'll give it a nice online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=182.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prominence and we'll get it all over our media We'll put it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=656.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then forward to City Council for their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1247.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1280.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who's using which school and when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1284.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1331.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1333.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1339.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the committee report, which was read, and then there's the action item on the old business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1344.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we should look at the old business item, and that's what you're voting, not the committee report you're accepting for information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1354.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just have to make a distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1355.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you're going to make a reference, you have to look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1357.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, is that you may know that Medford alumni Michael Bloomberg gave $50 million to the Science Museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1365.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a funny feeling we won't have to cost it for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1638.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you were to include the ADA regulations, you have to give them a book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1642.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're not going to read the whole book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1644.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The basic premise is it's accessible, transportation is accessible, the location is accessible and supports are provided, accommodations if required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1653.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three basic principles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2619.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call up Tony Sickney, our director of fine arts, to tell us about these music awards that have honored our students for their terrific participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2896.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're very versatile as a school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2899.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just saw all the music awards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2901.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we're talking about marketing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2903.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about sales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2905.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about the economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2907.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got our vocational director, our associate director, and our teacher of marketing, DECA, Frank Owisi, here to present some awards on DECA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2916.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the achievements that the students have made in their competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2920.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3346.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get asked, is there anything going on at the Medford Public Schools, you have some remarkable stories tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3353.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remarkable stories tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3371.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year, as you know, we have kindergartners who register for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3376.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we begin in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3379.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have building bridges to help parents understand the kindergarten program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3384.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got all the materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3385.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're just doing this to announce it taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3389.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want to attend and see how it goes, it's a great event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3393.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps people better understand how kindergarten works in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3397.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So without further ado, I think that's answers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3402.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maria's got a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3404.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: March 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3437.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So part of that is the fact that some of them will exercise choice options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3442.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for some reasons, they're also involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3444.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we could probably arrange a, let's say, a program that ties it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3449.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So once a choice is made, there's an open house or activity at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3453.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That might give us the best of both worlds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3455.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3467.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy passes that out all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3511.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have that material through the Building Bridges Program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3514.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I'll ask you questions I can look at I'll get you more specifics is actually what they do So the registration will begin on March 5th 2018<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3581.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as the mayor points out, you asked that we look at housing units or complexes at 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3588.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last time we did it was 150.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3591.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is that in-between group, and there were four of them there that we looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3596.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this gives you a breakout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3598.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't substantially affect our enrollment in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3601.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We still have plenty of capacity, and this gives you an update in general enrollment in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3640.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have access to that, so we can't really tell you that for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3644.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, the numbers of people coming and going, if they take an apartment for a short period of time, they leave before the child becomes school age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3653.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if the pattern is consistent with what we're seeing, it's probably not that many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3659.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not set up for large families, and so as a result, we don't see an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3680.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember the report we gave you was a September report, and naturally young people come in during the fall months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3687.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is really just the growth that would typically take place in the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3703.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you take a look, it's broken by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3704.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3736.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you take a look on the back page, you can see, for example, if you look at 48 Forest Street, where Forest Street is generally in the Roberts District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3746.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3747.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, you can, you can read, if you look at the thing, if you look at Mystic Valley Parkway, you're looking at the McGlynn primarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3754.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking at station landing, you're probably looking at somewhere between the Roberts and the, um, and the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3761.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, 9th Street, again, the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3763.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so that gives you an idea of where the, where the distribution is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3775.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, these people were included in your numbers before, but they weren't broken out because they weren't by 100 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3781.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked to find out whether or not there were young people in the 100 unit departments, and this is the breakout that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3787.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3793.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have any questions, we'll send you the other report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3815.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another, you know, report that you would ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3818.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is Chad and Jill still here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3820.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3842.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, remember, the media program is infancy this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3845.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3845.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you see is, you see the youngsters, you know, coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3849.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we find that that requires that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3852.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at this point in time, you know, if they're not there 100% of the time, because the freshman numbers make up, you know, the largest portion of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3860.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the freshmen are there and then the upperclassmen are only there one week on, one week off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3864.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3866.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The numbers really depend on the type of SHOP program that it is and also, you know, whether they're an A-Week, B-Week, and the freshman numbers of the first column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3875.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as I indicate in the report, 40 to 60 percent of the freshman numbers will probably stay with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3881.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so that number will come down, but the next class will come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3885.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we expect that the vocational CTE enrollments will increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3890.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they'll still be within margins that we can work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3893.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we need a second teacher, we'll go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3895.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't need a second teacher, we'll pull it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3898.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one thing I did note, that auto collision is very, very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3902.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a distinct possibility we'll either suspend that enrollment for going forward in the future and look at that area possibly for another type of shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3911.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll see how that goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3912.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what happens as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3917.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The regional that we most typically use doesn't have that program, so that's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3924.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Others do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3925.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3927.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt it, considering the fact that if they wanted it, they would have signed up for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3964.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So budget discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3966.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3990.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: say this for sure, is that if we recaptured a space such as the auto-collision space, we might convert that into something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3998.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one caveat of that particular space is it's right on top of the media center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4002.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We wouldn't want the banging going on in that center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4007.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd go with the flow a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4009.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did I say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4011.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd probably move it to a different area near the HVAC and move something else into that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4021.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman has about seven students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4023.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Essex Aggie has four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4025.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're an agriculture school that we don't have the capacity to serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4029.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect that the Minuteman number is going to drop down in half, if not more, next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4034.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And little by little, we won't have anybody at Minuteman, I would think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4037.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4053.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to explain this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4328.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've provided you a report on the state budget as it currently stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4334.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, House 2 is the governor's proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4337.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's proposal, with no disrespect to the governor, is generally dead on arrival in the legislature almost immediately because the legislature has its own view of what they want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4348.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although, many elements in the governor's budget will be sustained by the legislature as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4353.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are any number of things that have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4355.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we won't really get a final budget out of the state until June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4359.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a very good idea of where the House and the Senate are going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4364.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Primarily the Senate and the House, you know, when they get through the conference committee, probably in early June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4369.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably get a pretty good idea as to what's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4372.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we won't get a real vote on it until we're into June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4377.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we work on estimates and we, a lot of these things are ideas and they're trends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4381.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to go over some of them because they have an impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4384.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they also have an impact on what might happen at the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4388.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and what might happen with regard to the new tax laws that may or may not take place, and also, in fact, the new tax law that's been passed by the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4399.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's go over a couple of things so you're aware of it, because this informs our budget planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4405.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also informs our lobbying efforts at the state level, as we talk to people and ask for certain supplementals and other budgets to be upgraded as we move forward through the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4418.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the process begins every year with a consensus budget revenue estimate, which is agreed upon by the governor and the House and Senate leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4428.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that estimate this year went up about 3.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4435.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's nowhere near enough for all the things that people ask for, but that's where they're going right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4446.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the budget itself proposed a 2.6 increase to the budget of 40.9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4453.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The main source of education funding is Chapter 70.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4458.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 70 is done by formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4460.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done by student population, by need, and all those other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4464.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on that, we are a budget, our school, city, that is above foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4470.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most cities are, although there are a number of cities that are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4474.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're above foundation, you get minimum aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4476.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's proposal is $20 per pupil, which is a robust $93,000, which goes nowhere very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4485.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before we even think about it, $93,000 is out the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4490.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate and the House tend to increase that either by $5 to $10 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4495.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which still doesn't do that much for us, but it's still a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4498.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll be lobbying the House and the Senate to increase that particular amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4503.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the overall increase to Chapter 70 is $104.9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4509.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's for 321 operating school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4512.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can see that's not a lot of money going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4515.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can imagine the big cities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4517.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Boston, Worcester, Lawrence, Lowell, Fall River, New Bedford, places like that, with high need, get the bulk of those increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4529.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we move on a little bit, unrestricted local aid, which is not education aid, goes to the city, and that's up by 425,970.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4537.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't clap yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4541.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't clap yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4542.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the next line tells you that before you're through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4546.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you take away the assessments and you get a sheet here, we lose $17,000 in change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4552.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're getting $17,000 in change less based on the ins and outs of the cherry sheet, which is included here, the estimated cherry sheet and the governor's thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4562.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4563.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might think you're getting your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4565.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you hear people say you're getting all this money, you're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4568.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're getting is you're getting a balance between assessments and revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4572.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now that doesn't include things like, you know, meals tax and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4576.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's, that's a different ball game altogether, but direct aid to the city and to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4582.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, we net loss of 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4585.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, two major concerns in the governor's proposed budget that I want to mention is the underfunding of the charter school reimbursements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4594.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably somewhere in the vicinity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4597.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of $70 million less across the commonwealth than the formula or the entitlement formula would otherwise provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4608.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when people still rail against charter schools and enrollment in charter schools, it's because it's underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4614.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no problem with kids who want to go to charter school, go, but if you have an entitlement formula funded closer to the entitlement in every year, that hasn't increased for the last four or five years, that assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4625.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's something to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4628.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other factor is the circuit breaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4630.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The circuit breaker is for extraordinary special needs costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4634.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The way the circuit breaker works is that four times foundation, which in this instance is probably about $44,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4640.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy, roughly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4641.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, someplace in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4642.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It used to be $28,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4643.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: After you hit $44,000 on a placement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4650.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state allegedly will give us 75% back on the remaining budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4656.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say the cost of this private school is $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4661.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on that, the $56,000 delta would then be eligible for 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4668.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, they funded it at 65% in this budget, which means that at this particular point in time, Medford will be short somewhere around $155,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4680.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, going back to the charter school thing, the reimbursement's about $400,000 lower than it should be to Medford, based on the actual formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4690.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives you an idea that, you know, we have entitlement formulas, but they don't get funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4695.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably the saddest words in budget preparation is subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4702.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pass a law, you have an entitlement, and then it's subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4707.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the appropriation doesn't keep pace with the entitlement or the formula, you don't get what you think you're going to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4713.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's always a tricky factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4717.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple other variables that must be considered when planning a budget for fiscal 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4725.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uncertainty in the federal budget, impacting grants of Medicaid distributions to state, city, and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4731.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't know what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4733.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The costs of health care, always going up right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4737.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost of negotiated salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4739.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in collective bargaining right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4741.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever we negotiate has to be accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4743.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The impact of possible reduction in the sales tax through the initiative petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4749.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an initiative petition that could make its way to the ballot if it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4754.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be a reduction in the sales tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4758.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there's the fair share tax, which is sometimes known as the millionaire's tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4763.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If that were to go through, the estimate is that somewhere, the state might get $2 billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4769.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But how it gets distributed back to the cities and towns will depend on the formula that's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4777.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4779.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then of course there's the increase in other service costs, whether it be transportation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4783.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: energy or any of those things all have to be factored into budget planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4788.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is intended to give you a little bit of a appetizer as to how we have to look at the budget as we go forward for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4798.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, it's very important that we work very hard to secure our current and potential revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4802.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of our budget is based on revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4806.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to be aggressive about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4809.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some good possibilities, but they have to be developed aggressively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4813.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to maintain and enhance them so our educational programs and services don't get cut by reductions in aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4821.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House and Senate will be preparing their budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4823.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House begins in April, the Senate begins in May, typically, and the conference committee sometime towards the end of May, early June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4830.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we typically do budget, full budget in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4834.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do pre-budgets as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4836.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the next couple of months, you'll start seeing pre-budgets come out as the department heads<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4841.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and principals and school Councilors will come forward and tell you what they think their needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4845.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll have to listen to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4847.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll also be in collective bargaining discussions as to what we intend to do with our various unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4853.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a quick synopsis of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4855.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a couple of other articles to read in the back that you might find interesting with regard to budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4865.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They come from local publications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4868.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one of them state leaders are facing trickiest budget cycle in recent years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4873.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's another one back here that deals with the budget as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4877.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me see if I can give you the title of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4918.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the challenges that the city faces, you know, in funding schools and other city services is really characterized by this type of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4970.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: why don't we put it on an agenda for like community relations subcommittee meeting, which we can, and then possibly use our new media, you know, put it out there on the webpage and let people know the challenges the city faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4981.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's really, it's true of our virtually every city in town in the Commonwealth right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4986.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that Medford does do a lot of things locally to, to generate revenue, but it's a challenge more and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4994.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea when two and a half came in was, is that the state would step in and pick up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5084.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've intended to give people, you know, the inflation index numbers, you know, consumer price index, the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5089.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You give them an idea, but it really depends on what you're talking about, what the cost of a particular good and service is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5095.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some things are inflationary, some things are deflationary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5098.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, you have to really look at the item itself because the totality contains both inflationary and deflationary items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5106.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not easy to just simply put a simple number, but you can give people an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5110.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give people an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5132.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some Cambridge activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5135.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people have gone to Advanced Science, a little bit further, Marlborough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5139.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few that's better, but the big ones, Mystic Valley, Prospect Hill, and Cambridge are probably the biggest ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5145.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5146.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a listing of those at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5148.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, let's just start off by saying, because I know it's a sensitive topic, is that not necessarily against charter schools per se, it's the funding formula that needs to be sustained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5159.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, if you're going to say, well, this is going to happen, then it's got to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5164.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's just really just taking people down the road, and communities have to bear the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5170.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state doesn't want to take on the structural deficit, so they pass it on to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5176.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number, that $80 million, hasn't gone up in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5210.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5508.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just to cover that, I appreciate that Cheryl's done some research, but we need to be very careful of a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5514.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When people come in and give estimates, remember, we're a public entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5518.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go through a bid process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5520.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to pay prevailing wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5522.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have all number of things that we can't skirt around that maybe a contractor might say, you could do it for this, you could do it for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5529.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to concern ourselves about liability, things that are put together by people who mean well, but maybe are not professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5538.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: might actually get it done, but there might be something that goes wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5540.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it goes wrong, we could be liable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5543.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the suggestions are good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5545.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll look into them, but there's no silver bullet on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5549.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, people give us estimates all the time, some high, some low, but there are some other factors we have to pay attention to when we do procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5557.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make sure everybody understands it's not just a simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5561.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we have do things, even with the best intentions, we run into liability issues if they're not properly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5567.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5569.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So thanks for the ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5571.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's look into them, but let's be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5596.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to be very careful because if you put this interlocking rubber on top of what you've got, you've got to make sure that what's below it is properly set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5607.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have the best intentions and you do certain things, you may undercut the ability to put these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5616.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a shortcut or two that may seem plausible at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5621.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would want to make sure that it's done right because we're talking safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5624.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also have to make sure that the diameter of the rubber is at the proper thickness for the height of the structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5636.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that, I don't know what you quoted on the diameter of the rubber, but the rubber has to be a certain thickness in order to absorb shock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5644.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, that might take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5645.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have some structures that are higher and some that are lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5648.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All this should be thought through professionally, because the first time something goes wrong, there'll be some sharp lawyer out there who will take us down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5675.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, well, you know, let's go over together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5677.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's go, you know No, but it doesn't have to be done by hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5752.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have to sign off on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5754.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We sign off and send a letter of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6008.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Paul Texera is working on different languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6010.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no reason why the English language one can't begin to be disseminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6056.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When it's ready, we'll put it up as soon as it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6058.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6060.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6060.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to see Glenn this week anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6062.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Glenn's in Washington today, but he'll be back on this for the middle of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6384.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Glenn is coming back from Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6386.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He wasn't sure how many nights we wanted to go with focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6390.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He had set aside the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6392.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or initially, but he's available on the 13th and the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6396.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when he comes back tomorrow, I'll have a discussion with him as to whether he thinks we can do two a night or two, you know, or, or three a night if it necessary or needs a couple of days to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6407.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two a night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6409.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you have, you know, an hour for one group, an hour for another group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6411.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You are an hour and a half for one group, an hour and a half for another group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6418.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6419.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6421.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Glenn's going to be around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6422.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to set up a time as to when it's convenient for people who are in certain categories to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6428.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like you'd meet with certain administrators after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6430.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You could meet with teachers after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6432.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just need time to talk to Glenn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6436.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke to him today when he was in Washington as a conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6445.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6447.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6449.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll, we have to sit down and find out what he thinks is, you know, and you'll probably get that answer on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6454.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, what he thinks is an appropriate number of people to be in a focus group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6458.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cause obviously you don't need a hundred people in a room and won't, it won't give people a chance to talk, but you know, we're representative group and we have to think what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6572.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know that the applications have gone out to superintendents and assistant superintendents and other administrators across the state because I got one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6582.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6587.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A statement of her most interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6618.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a focus group of the administrators will be a collection of administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6622.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A focus group of teachers will be a collection of teachers representing all levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6627.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The community is a little tougher, and I want to take some guidance from Glenn as to how we set it up elsewhere and how we've got representation probably from each school, from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6635.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some of the other areas that have interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6638.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, you can't have everybody in the room at the same time, or it won't be much of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6643.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody will get half a comment, and it'll be over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6645.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6650.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6650.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then when you go to the larger arena, when people have public interviews, meet the candidates, you will have opportunities for people to interact with you and give you feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6661.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6662.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to get increasing amounts of feedback, and I'm sure you'll<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6665.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once names come out, you'll start to hear from people coming out anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6725.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk to... Childcare for what event though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6730.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can try and get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6732.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can try and get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6734.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of other things if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6737.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thursday night, taping, 7 o'clock at the theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6742.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, just so you're aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6744.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next week, we're going to start earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6747.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've sent you out an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6748.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll get a posting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6750.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Community of the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6751.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it'll be across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6754.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At 6?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6754.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to do it at like 6.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6755.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6758.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 6.15, Monday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6759.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 6.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6759.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can go over some things that are associated with the selection process so that we've got some guidance, and then we can move that forward, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6770.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6771.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6771.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to book 201 201 and the other pieces is that I've Suggested that in order to give us self-sufficient time that our regular meeting started 730, so we don't feel rushed You know if we want to take a few extra minutes to go over things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6784.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important that You don't feel like you're under fire to end the discussion if you need an extra 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6790.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6850.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost a record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=68.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane will answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=69.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've put things in place, but there's some things to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=71.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It still has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=182.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I could, just before you go there, Christine is not able to be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=188.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I may not be familiar with everything that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=191.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we could just hold it for another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=239.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Middlesex Partnership for Youth is a longstanding alliance we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=244.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally started with the District Attorney's Office, has now moved independently because of certain regulatory requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=250.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they provide multiple workshops and multiple collaborations with regard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=255.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: substance abuse, child abuse, mental health, all kinds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=258.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We run all kinds of workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=259.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's an annual membership that allows us to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=286.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me take a good look at that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=291.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Page 15 of January 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=295.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably a function of funds that went unused because they could not be applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=301.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes what happens, these things are for fringe benefits and the like, and if they're not applicable, we can't expend on them and then we have to return to the commonwealth at the end of the grant period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=309.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can get more specific once I get in behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=314.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, sometimes, you know, the categories don't match up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=342.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, it's probably for a category that we can't use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=345.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So sometimes it's more than most likely to infringe benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=349.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a person doesn't take something, we have to put it in the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=352.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they don't take the benefit, we can't expend against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=356.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to make a transfer, and sometimes they allow it, and sometimes they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=389.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where is that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=538.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So American Alarm is involved with our security and camera systems and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=544.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know the specifics of each one of these, but I'm sure it's tied into the fact we've just installed additional security pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=550.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I suspect that those are charges that are associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=553.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I see, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=706.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next one is not quite ready yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=740.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's on the agenda as a specific vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1108.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the estimates vary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1110.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds because we may not want to go with the same surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1117.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1124.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 15, 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1125.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to get a better estimate on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1127.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1134.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1142.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to look at a larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1144.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we can put it on the table tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1150.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll come back with more specifics and try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1159.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's probably the best way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1161.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1165.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1170.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This could be $75,000, $100,000, or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1173.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1321.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1324.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you want it on the next agenda, it has to happen in between now and the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1327.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So she has a March 2 deadline to submit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1330.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before February 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1333.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1334.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before February 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1334.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1343.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1349.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1354.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This afternoon, the mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the executive director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1363.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's quite substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1364.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you know, because we pay dues, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1373.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1374.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've put a pretty aggressive schedule together, as the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1381.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1386.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1394.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Glenn Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible and not, just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee, generally within a day, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1416.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create the circumstances in which this would go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1420.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd also work on creating focus groups and other aspects of this search site visits and other things that you may want to do or not want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1430.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1439.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is the path we're on so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1443.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1451.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1460.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1464.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1468.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1478.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He'll assist in the preparation of interviews, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1486.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went through a process of how they do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1488.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1494.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1496.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1508.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1515.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1522.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once it reaches the final stage, privacy's off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1526.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then people can see it, there'll be public interviews, there'll be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1534.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very extensive, and I think that based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that you'll see this is a very, very wide open search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1544.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intended to bring in candidates around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1547.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's in Lexington tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1548.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection and a few other communities that'll be moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1555.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1559.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1564.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quickly came to the table with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1565.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only did it last week and quickly came to the table today to work out some details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1604.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1609.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1666.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1666.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1696.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that, but we're not talking about search consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1703.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on what I've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1706.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1710.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's for full search done by them, totally by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1713.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already put some things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1715.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already done quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1716.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1719.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a number, but the number is not what would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1743.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1752.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an important area for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1753.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She spent over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1755.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for a replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1760.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance to look at the top three candidates that come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1769.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you'll give us feedback, and then we make an appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1773.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to get going with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1818.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1829.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts, as you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1835.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1848.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1860.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1867.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, renowned for doing some terrific programs, whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1884.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or other things that you have heard about over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1888.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to make you aware of it, because we're going to start to ramp up very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1893.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we hope that you'll all participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1896.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1905.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll also use our various media to talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities and the things we collaborate with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1913.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's just an informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1954.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've actually got some interviews going on, I believe, the end of this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1961.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1976.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The board will interview them and potentially even next week, they'll make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1986.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: will have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1994.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we'll have someone in place very soon in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1997.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When that person will actually take office, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2000.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2005.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I assume that in the interim, Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2013.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we expect that to happen fairly soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2016.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll get you posted as soon as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2027.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've named three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2029.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I want to speculate, I might have thoughts, but it would be inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2052.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2072.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse more so than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2079.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been, although, you know, it's quite a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2082.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2086.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Today, it's close to 38%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2087.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have an idea of what's taken place over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2093.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity, and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2107.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So adopting appropriate inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2114.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2119.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2121.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rather it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2128.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2131.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2139.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding, an enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2150.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2160.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2165.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2178.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing, and for us to be in the forefront of it is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2187.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good things happening in our community already, but the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2193.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be diligent with it, you can't let it slip, and we have a lot of things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2198.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it, but it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2233.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what we do is you, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it as an excuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2247.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've actually had a practice of doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2268.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2275.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people understand it, and some people agree, and some people don't agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2279.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I found the last little while, the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2288.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2288.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Generally around 8 o'clock or the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril, and we're endangering them and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2301.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2305.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the most part, people do understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2309.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2315.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2323.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to keep open if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2325.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2329.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2334.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, if conditions warrant it, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road, has to be balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2346.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with our decision to open the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2348.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2352.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they documented that they kept the youngster home because of the weather, and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way, we will provide an excused absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2365.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If, in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2376.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2380.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2385.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2393.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're entering the winter season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2395.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in the winter season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2397.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2404.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2410.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will use our media to inform people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2414.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use all the television media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2415.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use our own media to put things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2418.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use robocalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2420.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2425.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now this last storm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2426.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: had to wait till almost six o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2431.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now I knew in this area, we weren't going to get much snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2436.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2443.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how we would track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2448.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one before, people asked me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2453.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2457.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2459.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2463.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2468.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2472.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they have young people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2477.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2483.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be a productive day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2486.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are all kinds of considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2488.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to pay attention to whether DPW and the contractors can clear out lots, whether we think that the bus buses can actually make it up and go in the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2505.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very rarely perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2507.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2510.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season and we take a look and see what's happening and we try to make decisions that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2519.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2529.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't take school closings lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2532.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we think that safety is an issue, if we think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2539.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2544.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But some days it's not, we don't know until five o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2638.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk in the long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2648.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I find that unproductive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2649.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2656.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a trade-off to give kids some homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2658.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to do homework anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2660.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is that we want our teachers in front of students, and they don't want to trade days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2665.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that, we could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2677.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2683.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2684.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2754.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2756.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We sent you out, you know, on that particular day, I sent you out attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2760.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the high school was not badly attended that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2765.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was over 80% of the people that were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2767.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2770.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, you know, plus teachers, there weren't that many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2773.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2778.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2782.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certain areas of the building were still trying to adjust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2785.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can work on the heating system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2788.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can work on different aspects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2789.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a lot of people were in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2792.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2800.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2804.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2810.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a whole week would have been gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2812.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at least we got a couple days in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2814.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2815.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2816.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John and I will check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2829.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that, check the room out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2836.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put them in the warmest place as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3134.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3138.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, just to briefly summarize it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3145.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3149.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3151.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They give up a lot of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3152.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They generate a lot of support for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3154.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very grateful and thankful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3157.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3175.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to dovetail much better with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3177.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3188.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3196.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3203.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3204.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg gives us some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3206.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3209.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess he probably wouldn't send them to me anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3211.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and I'm appreciative that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3218.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3223.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3228.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them off or you can accept them as they're written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3232.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me know what you're... Would you like me to read them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3237.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3237.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3239.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, all PTG, PTOs, and other internal 501c3 organizations affiliated with the Medford Public Schools must be registered with the superintendent's office annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3249.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registrations must be renewed by September 1st of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3254.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A registration is simply a process of recognizing that an organization exists, and if they're out in the street, that there's a number they can have, and if a person who's a member of the community wants to donate, they know this is a valid organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3268.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also know that they exist, and they're using our name and raising money using our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3274.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To all registered organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3290.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MPS 1234, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3292.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3296.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3299.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3300.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see it as it comes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3302.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3303.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3303.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see the things that will be on the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3306.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who the officers are, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3310.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where they're banking, and the likes of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3317.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3326.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we want to know that every organization has some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3330.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3334.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3336.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3342.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And another reason for that is the fact that if everyone hits the same bank,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3346.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone hits the same business over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3351.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on our community pretty hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3353.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, but I already gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3358.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important for us to know who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3361.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3393.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3394.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can make changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3397.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3398.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's like our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3399.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project certain things and changes happen during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3401.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3403.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can just send in a note, say we did something different or we added something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3407.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe it doesn't have to be that tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3409.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me keep going and then we can hit it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3411.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these things intersect with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3414.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership and how a person becomes a voting member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3422.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3423.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, a person comes to a meeting, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been working on it for an extended period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3436.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a decision people can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3442.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must identify what is a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3445.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3448.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3449.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3452.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3458.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3465.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When is it going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3466.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3468.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3474.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3484.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter-indicative to the ones the school system has adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3492.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3498.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come just as the testing season's about to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3500.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're planning trips that are not tied to the curriculum in an important way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3506.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe once in a while, but not all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3508.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only have 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3510.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure all of them are used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3516.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The public schools through the superintendents offer training to each entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3520.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3526.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3531.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3536.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've gotta give them a form where technically you're paying them under the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3540.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3542.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3546.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What are you requiring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3548.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, tonight you asked about slips and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3551.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all heavily documented when it comes through the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3554.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are we documenting these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3557.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gives us an idea of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3560.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3570.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3574.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3579.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the general thing, there may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3596.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3601.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3608.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I guess the floor is open for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3810.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're looking at people who don't have experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3814.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3820.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3824.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a refresher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3825.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3827.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new forms that need to be filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3831.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3833.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3835.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the governance structure goes and elections, if there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3844.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you've got to let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer or how you participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3856.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And theoretically, under the school councils, you're supposed to have that election every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3861.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3862.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by the statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3864.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3868.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3868.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3880.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3884.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3885.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't consult me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3886.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what's part of the discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3888.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are people consulted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3889.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do they have a chance to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3891.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3896.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, does the PTO engage the community that it represents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3900.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3901.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think there's a balance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3903.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3914.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3917.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4000.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that the appropriate subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4003.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's, you know, let's, let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4006.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Support services deals primarily with services that support the educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4010.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is more rules of, this is more of the rules of the operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4016.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4281.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get it from the minutes, and then we'll move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6321.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe we made the adjustments you asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6324.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amounts and thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6550.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6552.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6554.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6558.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there's no such, you know, cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6563.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6568.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6602.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we'll move through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6603.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there's some people that resist any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6606.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: early this evening you're telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6610.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6610.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6614.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6615.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6626.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm trying to take it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6627.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, obviously the nurses indicated it's okay until she sees something specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6632.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if something comes up, we'll come bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6723.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Joseph Navetta was the husband of Angela Navetta, our retired secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3767.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3773.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3774.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a great place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3775.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a great place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3775.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be a great place for the community to gather and for our young people to develop culinary arts skills that will give them the opportunity to earn successful jobs in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3786.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a terrific opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3787.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3789.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to thank all the volunteers who helped to make today special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3794.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor's staff, the buildings and ground staff of the public schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3798.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Corey Barrasso, the chef instructor of the Bistro 489, and Chad Fallon, the director of the Vocational Technical School for preparing the collation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3810.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to all of you for coming out in the cold and braving it to be part of an important community event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3818.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this time, I would ask the police honor guard to retire the colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3869.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3944.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may be seated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3952.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we close today's ceremonies, we leave with renewed commitment and hope and confidence that our community will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3960.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first and last task of any leader is to keep hope alive and I think today you know that hope is alive and well in Medford and we are moving forward under the leadership of our mayor, our school committee and city council, as well as our state government, the governor, our congressmen, our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3980.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: leaders in the state legislature and the United States Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3984.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have terrific people leading us and all we need to do is get with it and support them so that we can continue to make Medford a great place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4008.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we allow our city officials and honored guests to leave, please remain seated so they can leave the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4015.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then afterwards, you're all invited to Bistro 489 on the second floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4019.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have guides to show you there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4021.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come and join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4022.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've prepared a wonderful collation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4024.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=608.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=615.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you a quick update the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=617.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm waiting to hear back from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=619.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did speak with him and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1108.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1122.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. Ronay, I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and if you'll permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1146.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1149.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1158.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students in grades three, four, and five who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1170.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1176.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what the student's need is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1178.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1182.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week, who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1190.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January, and the projected cost is an additional $6,200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1197.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1207.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1211.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1222.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1226.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1230.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be a need to create a consolidated route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1233.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, buses go in different directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1236.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1241.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1248.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1257.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1262.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make those adjustments based upon multiple factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1266.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1269.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1323.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we're planning it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1348.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1358.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be concentrated in a full bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1360.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be that we have a lot of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1362.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1379.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1383.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1387.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1391.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't make anybody participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1393.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1419.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1424.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: open it up a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1425.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's see exactly what kind of response we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1428.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1432.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I feel they can actually do that particular work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1436.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1441.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1453.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1484.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1495.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1516.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1673.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we discuss it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1735.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1764.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1952.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1965.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1971.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2020.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is something that's been in the works for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2023.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2029.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2031.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2044.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world, where I think that's a bigger need these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2743.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously, all these programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2748.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We seek outside funding to support them long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2751.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2756.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cummings is the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2757.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a three-year grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2760.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2766.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2775.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be having other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2777.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: outreaches to different people at different times because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2794.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the game plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2795.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2802.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're already getting some great recognition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2805.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2813.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2818.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the kinds of things we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2820.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we do these things, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2830.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: meaningful projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2867.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2874.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that's happening, again something I'll tell you about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2877.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at a subsequent meeting, is the Commonwealth Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is launching what they call it Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2889.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2904.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously testing is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2907.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we brag about as a nation, I mean, as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2915.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2921.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a good example of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2923.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2933.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they fill the gaps that many communities don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2937.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2941.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is how you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4527.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that we put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4541.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I had a good long chat with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4545.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: executives in the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4547.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And without going through the whole report, a year ago, 26 projects were approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4554.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, only 15 could be approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4559.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4565.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that a year from now, we'll be in the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4571.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4573.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We update a few more things that are in the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4575.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4580.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one of those things happens, and sometimes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4584.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money coming from the pool is greater or smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4588.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just happened to be one of those years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4591.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4602.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It hasn't been released yet, but when it's released, we'll know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4606.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4625.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going for the core program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4627.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The core program is April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4629.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4632.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a much smaller and more targeted program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4635.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is much more expansive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4638.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has longer term value to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4644.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to come back to you for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4645.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there's anything we want to emphasize or modify a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4653.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4662.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4668.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they had to be able to fit it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4675.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4676.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4735.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4743.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's plenty of projects we could go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4744.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be going to the Council on Technology in January and a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4749.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to keep moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4751.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4776.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so this is a report you've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4780.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee has a much more detailed report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4784.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4785.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone perhaps interfering with our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4794.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the cover report speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4796.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4801.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4810.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: security cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4814.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4819.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The newer models are a little bit more resilient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4822.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4825.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Placement of external cameras on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4836.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few cameras we have no choice but to put them on metal poles because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4843.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4848.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 154 cameras across the district in our nine schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4853.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4857.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ensure security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4859.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4868.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4877.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget significant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4882.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4887.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be prudent to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it'll be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4903.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over and use it in the year that we absolutely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4910.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4916.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4925.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have specifics, I would ask that the committee wants to talk to me about it and do it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4930.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to gain the system help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras are two types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that move and pan an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4966.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that are fixed on an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4968.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4976.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4983.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The system's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4984.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They no longer run DVRs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4986.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're now more digital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4987.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things are different than when they originally were installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4992.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cabling has to be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4993.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be locked into 911 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4996.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all these things require upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4998.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5000.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got good coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5003.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5010.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we talk and we set up our meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5019.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think at this particular point, we're in good shape and I think we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5024.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5028.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the security cameras because this is a big expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5031.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5074.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5076.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5087.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: make sure that people know that that's not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5111.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5117.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's not going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5151.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When do we make it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5153.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5154.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be the beginning of February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5156.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get the work done, and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5190.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean sorry charge policy I'm going to call upon our director of finance and administration to talk to you about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5196.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a requirement of the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6112.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6118.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6123.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If people are getting lunches who are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6127.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: eligible because they haven't done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6142.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where the federal law comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6145.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the commonwealth that have run up balances of 50, 60, $70,000, in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6153.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Was it Wellesley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6155.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Framingham, Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6161.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to have something, but it has to be reasonable so it can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6171.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6179.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6182.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way they look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6183.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to find some way to get something on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6186.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6190.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want us to come back with something a little less, let's say, severe as far as we're looking at it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6197.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6687.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Dr. Perreault is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6689.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you two reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6692.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is on the bus situation and the other is on vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6695.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we need major discussion tonight, but I want to give you an opportunity to get up-to-date on this so you're aware of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6702.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can follow up and I'll give you additional information as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6707.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Perreault has met with us today, and we've met with the bus company, we've met with the police, we've done a whole pile of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7205.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7207.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that a little bit, because we had an interesting discussion with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7212.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems that preferred seating is the back of the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7216.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They shoved to get to the back of the bus, because that's where they can have a little more mischief, perhaps, in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7222.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say that benevolently, but I mean, they want to get to the back of the bus and they're trying to get preferred seating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7228.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally you like to sit up close and get off the bus faster, but that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7232.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously we have to have a meeting with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7235.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to make it very, very clear that behavior on this bus is really going to be monitored very closely because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7244.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just can't put buses on just simply to get more of the same, because if they're going to push and shove on an uncrowded bus, they're going to push and shove on the next uncrowded bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7253.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to make sure that they understand that this is something, it's a privilege to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7257.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying very hard to give them the transportation they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7260.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they've got to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7262.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone has to own this solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7264.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also worked with the bus company, Christine worked with the bus company this afternoon, that if in fact we needed a backup bus on a given day because it was particularly cold or we anticipated bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7275.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say it was a snowstorm and we know that everyone's going to want to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7279.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could get a backup bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7280.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in that situation, but then it costs us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7283.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we wanna do these things, we wanna have contingency plans in place, but we need the students to cooperate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7290.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the headmaster points out, we're gonna have a meeting with them, we're gonna make it very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7293.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you do things you're not supposed to do, you're not gonna ride that bus, we're gonna take you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7298.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's a situation for us is that people like to go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7304.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't be in a situation where people who don't need the ride home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7309.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: get on the same bus, it just is not workable for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7313.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a major expense with that, especially now we're talking about adding a bus to the elementary schools, we're talking about other kinds of costs, we've had to add a bus to move some ELL students to the Brooks this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7324.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation costs are not inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7327.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It costs $375 a day for a bus, times 180 days, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7335.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to provide services, we expect people to be respectful and we expect them to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7341.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've gotta keep working at it, no question about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7344.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the injury is obviously tragic and unfortunate and we've been in contact with the family and we'll continue to be supportive to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7352.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But everyone's gotta own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7355.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just can't be, you know, whatever you do will be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7583.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing, I want to thank Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7585.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the first time in my career, someone said I was completely correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8439.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that, you know, Dr. Perreault is expressing extremely well is that this is a community thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8444.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents, everyone has to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8448.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you put enforcement in one place, they'll go to another place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8451.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll just move the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8453.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to change the outlook on the dangers about it and why it's not a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8459.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to work with the merchants, perhaps even to possibly put a city ordinance in to ban the sale of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8466.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be something that we can look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8467.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And possibly work with neighboring communities to get a regional ban in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8472.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it makes it that much more difficult to acquire the materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8476.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a comprehensive issue, but it's not going to be done by just having a person chase somebody down the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8485.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: nice for a particular situation, but not as a solution to the larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8496.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm hopeful that maybe it's banned in general, because I don't think it's good for adults either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8500.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If adults have it, they give it to the kids at home, just like a beer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8503.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're home, let's have a beer, we're watching a football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8508.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do this, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8509.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a sense that if a parent's doing it, it's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8514.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could I get that message across?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8910.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a number of presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8913.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to make each of them, and it's our custom to give everybody a chance to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8921.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8925.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let everybody say something and then make the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8927.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9588.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9593.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So having been around a long time, and having seen an awful lot of things, and having interacted with both of you in different ways and at different times, I have some perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9605.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll start with Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9608.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bob, you've been a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9610.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9612.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9613.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've come from a family with tremendous tradition in public service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9619.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An uncle who was a mayor of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9622.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a relative who was an uncle, I guess, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9630.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been on this committee through different periods of time when different activities were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9637.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You experience the sting of Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9640.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what it's like to be a teacher who got displaced, so you always have empathy for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9646.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you work for the state auditor, and you had a really good investigative mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9651.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you play Columbo in Mickey the Dunce, we know that you really know what's going on, even though you don't let on that you really know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9659.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how you play that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9664.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who knows Bob Scurry knows that Bobby really cares about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9669.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He does a lot of things that he doesn't take credit for, just quiet on the side, takes care of a kid here, takes care of a family there, and just doesn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9678.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I know about it because I hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9681.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that that really reflects on your good heart and your caring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9686.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And even though sometimes it looks like you've got that bravado coming on, you're really a soft puppy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9692.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you really care about people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9694.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're really one of these guys that you can always count on for loyalty and knowing what's going on without making a big deal out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9702.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were the secretary for the committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9704.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You went over all the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9706.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little got by you, if anything got by you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9709.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you sometimes give me a wink and say, what is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9713.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I try to dance a little bit, and you give me a wink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9716.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you say, don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9717.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I remember all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9720.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of history, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9723.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go back a long way, and I look forward to seeing you around the community and interacting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9727.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I know that while you're not sitting as a member,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9731.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you'll still be an active citizen and an active contributor to the young people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9736.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9737.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's all about now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9739.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Ann Marie, you are a person that I've come to know very, very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9744.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been very active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9745.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were involved with student sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9749.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were involved with student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9753.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little went on that Ann Marie didn't get involved in, school councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9759.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were one of the great joiners of all time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9761.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was something to belong to, Ann Marie was one of the members who was joining on to that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9769.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You rose up through the ranks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9770.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You became involved in the state association and rising to the rank of president of MASC, which gave you incredible perspective and you brought back a lot of very good ideas and brought back an awful lot of very, very good thoughts to help the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9787.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9788.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can always count on you to listen and to understand some of the perspectives we may have, even if you couldn't vote on a particular issue the way I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9796.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But still, you understood it, and you provided good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9802.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're an individual that I will clearly miss, along with Bob, as I feel like you've really contributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9809.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that your involvement at the state level will continue to be an important factor as we go forward in public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9818.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank you both because it's been a great ride with both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9823.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I reflect on all the things that I've succumbed to see, I know that the two of you are among the best school committee members that I've served with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9831.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9833.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=599.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=606.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you a quick update the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=608.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm waiting to hear back from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=610.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did speak with him, and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1093.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1097.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1101.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1113.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. René,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1127.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and with your permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1137.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1138.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1140.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1149.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students in grades 3, 4, and 5 who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1161.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1167.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what the student's need is and what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1173.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1181.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January and the projected cost is an additional $6,200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1188.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1198.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1202.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1213.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes, we will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1221.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then maybe you need to create a consolidated route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1224.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, buses go in different directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1227.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1232.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1239.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1248.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1253.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make those adjustments based upon multiple factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1257.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1260.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1269.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a number of things to be worked out in the interim, but this is the basic plan and hopefully that addresses your issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1314.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we're planning it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1339.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1349.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be concentrated in a full bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1351.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be that we have a lot of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1353.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1370.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1374.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1378.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1382.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't make anybody participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1384.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1410.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can open it up a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1416.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's see exactly what kind of response we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1419.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1423.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I feel they can actually do that particular work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1427.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1432.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1444.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1476.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1486.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1507.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1573.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1725.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1755.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1943.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1956.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department is not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2010.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is something that's been in the works for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2014.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator and you have some materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2022.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm gonna let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2035.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world where I think that's a bigger need these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2736.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, all these programs, we seek outside funding to support them long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2742.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2747.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cummings is the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2748.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a three-year grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2751.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2757.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2766.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be having other outreaches to different people at different times, because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2785.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the game plan, and obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs, and they're already getting some great recognition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2796.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national, so I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2810.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the kinds of things we want to do, and as we do these things,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2814.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep meaningful projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2858.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2865.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that's happening and something I'll tell you about at a subsequent meeting is the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2872.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is launching what they call Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2880.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day, and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2895.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously testing is something that we brag about as a nation, I mean as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2906.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2912.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a good example of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2914.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2924.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they fill the gaps that many communities don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2928.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2931.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is how you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4518.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that was put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4532.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I had a good long chat with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4536.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: executives in the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4539.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And without going through the whole report, a year ago 26 projects were approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4546.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year only 15 could be approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4550.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4556.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that a year from now we'll be in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4560.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be in the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4562.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4564.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We update a few more things than in the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4566.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4571.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one of those things happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4573.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes the money coming from the pool is greater or smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4579.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just happened to be one of those years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4581.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4593.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hasn't been released yet, but when it's released we'll know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4597.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4616.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going for the core program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4618.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The core program is April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4620.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4623.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a much smaller and more targeted program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4627.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is much more expansive and has longer term values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4634.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to come back to you for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4636.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there are any things we want to emphasize or modify a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4644.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4652.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4653.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4659.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they have to be able to fit it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Staff report, please, on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4726.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4734.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's plenty of projects we can go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4735.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be going to the council on technology in January and a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4740.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to keep moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4742.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4767.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so this is a report you've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4772.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee has a much more detailed report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4775.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't, as a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4782.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, perhaps interfering with our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4785.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the cover report speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4787.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4792.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4801.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4805.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years, they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4811.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The newer models are a little bit more resilient, but are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4816.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Placement of external calendars, cameras rather, on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4827.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few cameras<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4828.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have no choice but to put them on metal walls because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4834.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4839.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 154 cameras across the district in our nine schools, and believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4849.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ensure security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4849.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4859.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4868.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4872.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: significant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4873.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4878.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be approved to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it will be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4893.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4897.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and use it in the year that we absolutely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4901.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4907.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4916.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4917.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would ask if the committee wants to talk to me about any of it, you know, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4921.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to game the system at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4954.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras are two types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4954.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that move and pan an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4957.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that are fixed on an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4959.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4967.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4974.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The system's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4975.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They no longer run DVRs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4977.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're now more digital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4978.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things are different than when they originally were installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4983.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cabling has to be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4984.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be locked into 911 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4987.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all these things require upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4989.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4991.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got good coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4995.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5000.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as we talk and we set up a meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session, allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5010.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think at this particular point, we're in good shape, and I think we've moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5015.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5019.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the security cameras because this is a big expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5022.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5065.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5068.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5077.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to make sure that people know that that's not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5101.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5108.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5142.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we make it as soon as possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5145.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be the beginning of February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5147.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get the work done and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5183.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to talk to you about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5187.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a requirement of the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6103.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6109.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6114.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If people are getting lunches who are not eligible because they haven't either done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6133.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where the federal law comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6136.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the Commonwealth that have run up balances of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6141.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, was it Wellesley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6146.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Framingham, Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6152.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to have something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6154.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it has to be reasonable so we can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6162.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6170.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6173.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way they look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6174.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to find some way to get something on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6177.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6181.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want us to come back with some, you know, something a little less, let's say, severe as far as you're looking at it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6188.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6678.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Dr. Perrault is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6680.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you two reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6682.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is on the bus situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6684.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other is on vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6686.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we need major discussion tonight, but I want to give you an opportunity to get up-to-date on this, so you're aware of what's going on, and we can follow up and give you additional information as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6698.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Prowler has met with us today, and we've met with the bus company, we've met with the police, we've done a whole pile of things, and let Dr. Prowler explain the reports in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7196.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7198.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that a little, because we had an interesting discussion with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7203.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems that preferred seating is the back of the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7207.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they shoved to get to the back of the bus, because that's where they can have a little more mischief, perhaps in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7213.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say that benevolently, but I mean, they wanna get to the back of the bus, so they're trying to get preferred seating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7219.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally you like to sit up close and get off the bus faster, but that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7223.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously we have to have a meeting with the students, we have to make it very, very clear that behavior on this bus is really going to be monitored very closely, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7235.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just can't put buses on just simply to, you know, get more of the same, because if they're going to push and shove on an uncrowded bus, they're going to push and shove on the next uncrowded bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7244.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to make sure that they understand that this is something, it's a privilege to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7248.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying very hard to give them the transportation they want, but they've got to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7253.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone has to own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7255.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also worked with the bus company, Christine worked with the bus company this afternoon, that if in fact we needed a backup bus on a given day because it was particularly cold or we anticipated bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7266.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say it was a snowstorm and we know that everyone's going to want to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7270.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we could get a backup bus in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7272.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then it costs us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7274.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we wanna do these things, we wanna have contingency plans in place, but we need the students to cooperate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7281.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the headmaster points out, we're gonna have a meeting with them, we're gonna make it very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7284.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you do things you're not supposed to do, you're not gonna ride that bus, we're gonna take you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7289.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's a situation for us is that people like to go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7295.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't be in a situation where people who don't need the ride home get on the same bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7301.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just is not workable for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7303.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a major expense with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7305.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Especially now, we're talking about adding a bus to the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7309.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about other kinds of costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7310.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had to add a bus to move some ELL students to the Brooks this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7315.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation costs are not inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7318.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They cost $375 a day for a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7322.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: times 180 days, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7326.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to provide services, we expect people to be respectful and we expect them to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7332.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've gotta keep working at it, no question about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7335.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the injury is obviously tragic and unfortunate and we've been in contact with the family and we'll continue to be supportive to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7343.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But everyone's gotta own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7345.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just can't be, you know, whatever you do will be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7574.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7575.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank Justin for the first time in my career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8429.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8430.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that, you know, Dr. Burrell was expressing extremely well is that this is a community thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8436.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents, everyone has to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8438.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you put enforcement in one place, they'll go to another place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8442.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just move the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8444.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to change the outlook on the dangers about it and why it's not a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8450.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to work with the merchants, perhaps even to possibly put a city ordinance in to ban the sale of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8456.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it may be something that we can look at and possibly work with neighboring communities to get a regional ban in the area, so it makes it that much more difficult to acquire the materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8467.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a comprehensive issue, but it's not going to be done by just having a person chase somebody down the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8474.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8476.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: nice for a particular situation, but not as a solution to the larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8482.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8486.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just, you know, hopeful that maybe it's banned in general, because I don't think it's good for adults either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8491.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If adults have it, they give it to the kids at home, just like a beer, you know, your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8497.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a beer or watch a football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8499.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do this, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8500.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a sense that if a parent's doing it, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8505.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gotta get that message across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8901.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a number of presentations here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8904.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to make each of them, and it's our custom to give everybody a chance to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8912.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8916.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let everybody say something and then make the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8918.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9579.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9584.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So having been around a long time, having seen an awful lot of things, and having interacted with both of you in different ways and at different times, I have some perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9596.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll start with Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9599.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bob, you've been a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9601.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9603.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9604.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've come from a family with tremendous tradition in public service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9610.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An uncle who was a mayor of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9613.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a relative who was an uncle, I guess, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9621.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been on this committee through different periods of time when different activities were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9627.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You experienced the sting of Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9631.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what it's like to be a teacher who got displaced, so you had always empathy for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9637.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you worked for the state auditor, and you had a really good investigative mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9642.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you play Columbo and Mickey the Dunce, we know that you really know what's going on, even though you don't let on that you really know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9650.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how you play that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9655.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who knows Bob Scurry knows that Bobby really cares about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9660.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He does a lot of things that he doesn't take credit for, just quiet on the side, takes care of a kid here, takes care of a family there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9667.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he just doesn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9669.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I know about it because I hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9672.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that that really reflects on your good heart and your caring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9677.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And even though sometimes it looks like you've got that bravado coming on, you're really a soft puppy and you really care about people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9685.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're really one of these guys that you can always count on for loyalty and knowing what's going on without making a big deal out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9693.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were the secretary for the committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9695.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You went over all the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9697.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little got by you, if anything got by you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9701.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and you sometimes give me a wink and say, what is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9704.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I try to dance a little bit, and you give me a wink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9707.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you say, don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9709.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I remember all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9711.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of history, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9713.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go back a long way, and I look forward to seeing you around the community and interacting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9718.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I know that while you're not sitting as a member, you'll still be an active citizen and an active contributor to the young people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9726.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9728.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's all about, pal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9730.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Ann Marie, you are a person that I've come to know very, very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9735.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been very active, you were involved with student sports, you were involved with student activities, very little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9745.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: went on that Ann Marie didn't get involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9748.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School councils, you were one of the great joiners of all time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9752.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was something to belong to, Ann Marie was one of the members who was joining on to that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9760.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You rose up through the ranks, you became involved in the state association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9764.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the rank of president of MASC, which gave you incredible perspective, and you brought back a lot of very good ideas, and brought back an awful lot of very, very good thoughts to help the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9778.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9778.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can always count on you to listen and to understand some of the perspectives we may have, even if you couldn't vote on a particular issue the way I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9787.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But still, you understood it, and you provided good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9793.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're an individual that I will clearly miss along with Bob, you know what I mean, as I feel like you've really contributed and I believe that your involvement at the state level will continue to be an important factor as we go forward in public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9809.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank you both because it's been a great ride with both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9814.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I reflect on all the things that I've come to see, I know that the two of you are among the best school committee members that I've served with, so I want to thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9824.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9824.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8064.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I have had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8069.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8074.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8075.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8079.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8086.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8094.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8099.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8100.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8108.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8110.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8116.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8121.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8128.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8134.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8146.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8152.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8153.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8154.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8156.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8158.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8161.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8170.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8172.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8187.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8200.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8202.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8208.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8212.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8224.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8228.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8235.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8242.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's uh, you know an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8251.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked uh, Stephen Hershey who's the again superintendent of Beverly um, because mississippianities was contacting the Beverly school committee and others up in Beverly and uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8265.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are siding with the Beverly public schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8268.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I you know, I need a lot more Feeling as to what's really took place point of information man The superintendent has the game officials committee been contacted to find out who the referee was and I asked I asked for that information I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8286.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8288.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8290.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8299.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8308.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8313.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8334.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8335.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't do a film in the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8336.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: game and they may have filmed the varsity game but I don't think from the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8371.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me let me if I can mirror let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey Because I'm putting on my cell phone and they'll give you an idea of you know, the strength of his comment It wasn't like I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8385.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very very, you know direct So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8573.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8585.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8587.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8591.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8595.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8599.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8604.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8609.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8613.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8619.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8620.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8621.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8624.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8626.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8631.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8645.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8654.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8655.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8660.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8661.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8662.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8812.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8837.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was prepared, that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8999.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9015.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor too in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9017.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, the more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive, you know, and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9254.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9256.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9257.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9262.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9267.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9275.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9281.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but then we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9287.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9292.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced who don't pay a user fee for athletics would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9299.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9300.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11990.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative and you know but as we move forward we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12939.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12943.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12955.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12957.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12961.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12963.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just want to let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13804.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13809.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13823.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13825.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13833.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13836.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13841.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13847.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13853.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13887.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13890.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13895.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13897.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13904.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13912.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13917.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13933.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13941.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14037.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14043.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14052.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14073.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14083.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14112.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14124.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14139.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14147.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14151.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge, cognitive language, is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14169.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14174.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14176.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14184.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14185.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14190.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14196.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are going to look at the blend of programs and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14212.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14216.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: been working to get SCI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14229.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14235.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: receive students who have this English language need to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14244.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14250.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14253.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14254.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14256.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as you move people around, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14260.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14273.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14280.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you'd come on up and give us a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14285.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14688.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14691.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14693.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14700.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14708.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14712.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL endorsement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14824.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to Bernadette Bernadette to director of curriculum to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15241.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15556.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15557.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15585.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15590.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15594.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15600.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms of the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15618.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15620.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16210.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16217.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16227.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16229.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16236.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16244.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16248.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's a typical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=470.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=475.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=480.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=481.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=485.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=492.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=500.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=505.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=506.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=514.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=522.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now, and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=527.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student, but not necessarily the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=534.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=540.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student, and also that the trainer was not licensed, and they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=558.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, this is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=560.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=563.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=564.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=567.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=576.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=593.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to the Beverly Public Schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=597.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=601.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that for some reason, the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=608.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=614.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game too if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=618.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=630.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=634.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=641.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=648.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's you know, an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=657.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, we have a back and forth going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=660.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the again, superintendent of Beverly, because Mississippi nineties was contacting the Beverly School Committee, and others up in Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=670.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=671.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=674.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I need a lot more feeling as to what's really took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=678.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=686.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=692.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=694.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm gonna get a follow-up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=696.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=705.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=714.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=719.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=740.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt they were filming the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=742.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=783.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because I'm gonna put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of the strength of his comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=789.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=791.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was very, very direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=794.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=979.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=991.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=993.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=997.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1001.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1005.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1010.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1015.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1019.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1024.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1026.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1027.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1030.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1033.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't draw a conclusion without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1037.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1039.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a little bit more to follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1041.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1051.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1060.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1061.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1066.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1217.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1218.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1243.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1410.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1421.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1423.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1428.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1660.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1662.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1663.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1668.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1673.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers, because they're much higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1677.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1687.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that we'd like to increase, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1693.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1698.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4396.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4401.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5349.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5361.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5363.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5366.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5369.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6210.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6215.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that every year, we're going to have to allocate money for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6219.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6225.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can go all year long and then find that we need cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6232.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6239.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6242.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6245.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6247.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered, so rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6257.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6292.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6296.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6300.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6303.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6309.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6318.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6319.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6323.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6339.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6441.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6449.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6458.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that will come forward as a major proposal and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6488.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6518.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6530.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed a initiative petition, which he previously had some success in Arizona and California,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6540.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6544.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was given great support from John Silbert at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6552.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6557.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6558.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6563.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge or cognitive language, is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6574.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6580.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6582.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them, and we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6591.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6596.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6601.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are going to look at the blend of programs, and Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6618.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6622.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now, for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6635.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need, to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6650.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6656.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6658.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6660.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6666.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6679.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6685.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and give us a discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7094.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7097.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7098.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7106.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7113.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7119.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7192.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7193.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7199.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7200.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEI enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7208.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7229.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we've responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7961.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's gonna hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7963.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7965.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7966.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7990.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're gonna have some field trips that are gonna show up in the next little while, and if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8000.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8006.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8025.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8616.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate because what happens is the circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8622.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8633.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8635.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8641.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8650.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8653.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=479.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=484.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=489.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=490.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=494.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer, who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=501.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=509.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=514.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=515.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=523.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=525.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=531.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=536.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=543.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=549.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=561.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=566.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=568.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=569.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today from Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=573.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=576.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=585.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone, and I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to Beverly, uh, the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, um, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=615.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=617.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=623.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=626.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=639.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=643.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=650.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=657.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if... Well, that's an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=666.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the, again, superintendent of Beverly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=673.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because Mississippi was contacting the Beverly School Committee and others up in Beverly and they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=683.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I need a lot more feeling as to what really took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=687.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=694.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=701.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=703.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow-up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=705.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=714.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=728.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=749.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt they were filming the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=751.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=785.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me, if I can, Mayor, let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey, because I'm going to put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of, you know, the strength of his comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=798.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=800.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was very, very, you know, direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=803.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=988.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1000.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1002.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1006.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1010.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1014.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1019.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1024.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1028.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1033.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1035.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1036.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1039.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1041.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1046.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1060.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1068.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1069.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1070.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1075.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1076.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1225.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1227.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1252.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1414.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1419.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1430.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1432.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1669.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1671.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1672.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1676.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1677.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1682.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1690.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1695.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1702.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1707.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1714.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1715.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1722.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4405.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4410.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5354.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5358.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5370.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5371.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5375.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5378.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6219.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6224.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6237.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cameras have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6240.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6248.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6251.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6256.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6261.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6268.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6301.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6305.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6309.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6312.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6314.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6318.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6327.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6332.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6348.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6356.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6450.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6458.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6467.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6517.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6527.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6539.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6554.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, it was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6561.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6565.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we, we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that have required deep cognitive knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6579.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cognitive language is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6583.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6589.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6591.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6599.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6600.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6605.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6608.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6609.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, we are going to look at the blend of programs, and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of, uh, situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6626.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, also, as you probably know, uh, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6631.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6644.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6654.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6659.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6665.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6667.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6669.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6675.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the, um, beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what, what options are available to you and, uh, what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6688.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, but tonight, uh, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and, uh, some of the other things that, uh, Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6694.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and, uh, give us a, uh, a discussion on, on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7103.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7106.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7107.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7115.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7122.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7127.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7201.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7202.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7238.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7655.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7970.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7972.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7974.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7975.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7999.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8004.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8009.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8015.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8032.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8034.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8625.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8631.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8642.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8644.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8659.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8662.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=262.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, as you know, project 351 was started by Governor Patrick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=276.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was an attempt to provide leaders who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=281.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come from our middle schools, and they would do community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=284.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we've done this for a number of years, and this evening, we have two representatives, one from the McGlynn and one from the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=293.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And right now, we'll call upon our principal, Paul DeLeva, to introduce the person from the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=782.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the School Committee, I'm going to call upon Tony Vento, our Health Supervisor, to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=789.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Kristen Goodell has taken a position at Boston University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=793.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as a dean, and she's done a great job for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=796.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Dr. Sabia is going to do a great job for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=799.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We met the other day, and we're really excited to have him on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=802.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm going to let Tony introduce him and let Dr. Sabia make a few remarks and answer any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=971.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this particular report is letting you know that the federal government has now approved our E-rate tier 2 funding, which is a substantial amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=981.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It needs to be matched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=983.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's approved here this evening that will go forward, I'll go to the City Council at a future date to ask for the matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=989.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will allow us to expand our infrastructure to support our networks, to increase our switches and all the other aspects of the infrastructure that supports technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1000.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirstine Patterson is a lead person locally on this and she's going to tell you a little bit more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1226.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1229.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1232.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I worked it out the date with the mayor and based on what's on their calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1263.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year we have a Veterans Day program, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli is the coordinator, and she's going to come up and tell you about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1709.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Mayor and members of the school committee, tonight we're going to prove there is such a thing as a free lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1713.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Kirsten is going to cover that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1857.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's going to the deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1867.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it'll be stocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1869.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1870.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The donation of the deck appears to be what's ticketed for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1878.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: December 4th is the opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1881.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1917.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a couple of foreign language approvals in front of us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1921.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about them at our committee of the hall, so Rita is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1925.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, let me congratulate Rita publicly for her award from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1930.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the Italian Association for her outstanding work as an Italian teacher and administrator promoting programs in Italian culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1938.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1940.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1945.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other evening, Friday evening, at the Dry Dock, the Innovation Center, Rita was there receiving audits from a whole pile of people who were involved in Italian culture, including the Consul General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1958.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Rita deserves all the work, all the credit that she gets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2474.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: State Leadership Conference in Marlborough, SkillsUSA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2478.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year is no exception and we're going to be sending a couple of teachers and four students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2484.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be paid for by grant money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2486.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be staying overnight so that they can participate in the full range of activities and we need the school committee to approve it so that we can take this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2495.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Trip on Schools USA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2511.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, it was unfortunately a situation where Mr. Fallon is new to our system and didn't realize it needed to come into us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2518.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We wanted to bring it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2519.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly in the future, we understand it needs to come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2580.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll call on our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3228.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, I think we all know that building maintenance, building condition, is a popular topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3237.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3242.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is the authority that's been put in place to assist with renovations, major renovations of schools, but they also try to keep track of where schools are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3252.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we all know where the pimples are and where the tiles are missing in any one school in our own world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3261.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you look at the range of schools across the Commonwealth,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3265.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't do badly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3267.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the report I'm providing you is a report that it was done by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3271.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was done by a field visit to our schools by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3276.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they went to all the schools across the Commonwealth, virtually all of them, didn't get to everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3283.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they assessed and evaluated several key factors, including building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3293.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The study was conducted by architectural engineers, engineers in general, and who visited each specific building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3303.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, school buildings that were slated for MSB upgrades, already slated in the pipeline, weren't visited because they already had been out there and done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3310.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The buildings were rated on a four-point scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3313.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the general condition and general learning environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3316.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A rating of one was the best, and a rating of four was the lowest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3321.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all buildings were rated for capacity utilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3324.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Underutilization was considered to be 80% or less, below 80% rather, and overutilization was above 125% of the capacity of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3337.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I provided you with selected pages of the MSBA report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3340.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was 96 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3341.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't think you wanted to read it all, but if you do, I can certainly provide it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3345.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I picked those pages I thought were relevant to us and would give us insights as to how they came up with these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3352.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you'll note if you go down to Medford schools and the building condition, all of our schools, with the exception of the high school and the vocational school, were rated one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3361.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the vocational school were rated two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3365.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But all our buildings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3367.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for general environment were rated one based on their study, not something we did for them, not something we told them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3375.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They came out and rated it with their people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3378.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, building capacity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3382.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We fall into the average range in every building, while Brooks, Columbus, McGlynn, and Roberts are considered average, the Andrews a little bit under, McGlynn under, high school under, vocational under, and the Curtis Tufts under, in terms of capacity, in terms of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3397.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now people talk to me about, is there capacity to absorb young people into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3402.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3403.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I've looked at this, I gave you a report not that long ago on the impact of development upon enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3409.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm working on a report that deals with some of the smaller buildings, which there aren't that many with young people in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3417.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, that is not changing anything as far as I can see so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3422.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important when people ask us about our building conditions to recognize that we have had them looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3429.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's certainly room for improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3431.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one's going to say that we do everything the way it should be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3434.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we're not bad compared to buildings, school buildings around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3445.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have put in an SOI to the state, statement of interest for the high school and the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3451.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hear before the first of the year whether or not we will be allowed to go to feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3457.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe we're now in a pool of 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3460.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 88.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3460.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're now down to 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3463.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be less than that now since their last visit to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3467.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully we'll hear about that and we'll be able to move forward with a feasibility study looking at those two major buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3474.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3476.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3487.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they do have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3490.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're generally better than many others, but there are some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3493.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can get you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3550.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they also want to, if they put an app in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3554.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they also want to make sure that buildings that are doing okay, stay okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3560.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are specific elements of our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3564.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like in our world, we want to work on the systems in the high school and the vocation school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3568.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to work on the shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3570.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to work on other aspects of the facility that will enhance it over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3575.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember that building is, what, over 45 years old now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3580.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a solid building, it's not going away, but it can use some upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3584.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think these are the things that we want to push with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3588.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a very good meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3590.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought when they left, they were very pleased with the kind of tour that we took with them and the information we gave them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3597.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's competitive, so we'll find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3604.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, they went around the whole place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3607.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They went around the whole place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3608.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now remember, we've got an oil project from them, we've got the science projects from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3613.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we've got some other things from them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3615.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it isn't like they've ignored us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3618.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, you know, the things we were talking about with them were, I think, well-received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3624.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3631.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, actually, I turned that around on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3633.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I said to them, see, your money really was put to good use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3635.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3638.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very good with your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3639.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should give us more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3640.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3654.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they composited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3656.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report did not break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3660.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3661.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3663.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3734.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to announce it Monday night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3736.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to talk about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3742.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: M-A-S-C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3771.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in June 2016, the Medford school committee approved the succession plan for the position of superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3779.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have attached a copy of that plan to my remarks this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3783.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While it's within your discretion to keep, modify, and change the plan, it is a fundamental blueprint to begin the processes of succession and transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3793.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will continue on Monday evening with Glenn Kuchar, who is the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3802.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been my privilege and honor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3806.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to be an educator in Medford, in the Medford Public Schools, for 50 years, and to serve as superintendent of schools, your superintendent of schools, for 23 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3817.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've greatly benefited from the high quality and diligence of professionals, support staff, school committee members, and citizens who have worked with me throughout my career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3828.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I am internally grateful to them for making my tenure and responsibilities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3833.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as productive and as rewarding as reasonably possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3838.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been very fortunate to have seen former students become teachers, administrators, and staff in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3845.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've had the experience of enrolling children and grandchildren of former students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3852.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While no one does significant work alone, I've had the opportunity to build new schools, establish a full range of programs, acquire hundreds of millions of dollars in grants,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3863.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for our community and school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3866.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Understandably, there's room for improvement, but much has been done and more will be done in the months ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3875.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one gets to finish everything, but we have put a lot in place and that will be a solid foundation for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3883.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Therefore, I am here informing the Medford School Committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3887.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that it's my intention to retire from the position of superintendent of schools, Medford Public Schools, at the completion of my contract on June 30th, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3897.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This decision has been made without reference to any governmental change or any issues that are in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3907.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is simply the right period of time for me to spend more time with my family and to pursue special causes and interests<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3915.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that have not been possible given the schedule and work responsibilities of an active school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3923.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is my intent and plan to be fully engaged in the months ahead as your superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3928.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a lot of positive opportunities, some of which we've talked about tonight, ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3933.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will do everything possible to optimize and achieve our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3938.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, I will be committed to ensuring a smooth and effective transition to new senior leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3944.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4118.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Pauline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4118.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4489.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4490.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4577.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4580.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an extraordinary paper about concussions that fall over, but it's not making much of a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=137.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=139.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since that time, grievances were filed and other processes, legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=145.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session, because I believe it affects our legal status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=151.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=382.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=383.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=706.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a report on the Nellie Mae Education Foundation Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=709.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who is a recipient of the O'Toole Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=716.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=719.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=721.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=722.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1589.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2296.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2299.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2303.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2309.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2311.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2316.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2320.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2322.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2325.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2330.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2337.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2347.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2350.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2670.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the program is a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2673.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2685.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting edge activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2688.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2693.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2696.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2698.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2703.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2706.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2712.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2722.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend, and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2742.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more to enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2752.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2753.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2850.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2854.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2867.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2869.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2870.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2951.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2955.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2963.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers, did a good job doing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2966.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2971.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2977.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2979.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning, and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2984.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions, as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2990.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers, and administrators, and professors, and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3007.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3008.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3022.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3023.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he'll come back, as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed, and how it can be advanced, and where we can grow from it, and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3034.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3040.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3042.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3050.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we bring back some ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3053.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3111.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Zizou actually participated in a teleconference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3116.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was earlier in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3118.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting at the international symposium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3192.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3201.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3208.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3209.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3217.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3227.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3231.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our students will be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3238.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3270.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick, one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3282.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released his transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3291.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3295.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3298.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3415.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5010.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5018.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5024.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years, but with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved and many more people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5035.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5037.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources to the school administration, the various shop instructors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5046.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories, include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5057.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5064.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5073.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5084.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're in violation, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5088.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5094.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5097.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5101.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5104.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5110.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5112.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5115.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5119.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5128.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5132.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5139.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5149.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5158.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5163.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5166.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5170.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them combine because of the affinity for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5173.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5176.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5182.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5202.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5203.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5212.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers, and we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5225.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Jill is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5241.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5243.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5563.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5565.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5796.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy, you want to comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=129.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=131.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since that time, grievances were filed, the processes, legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=136.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status, and I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=374.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=375.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=695.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educators Foundation grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=701.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O2 award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=708.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=710.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=712.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=714.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2287.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2291.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2294.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2300.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2307.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2311.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2313.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2317.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2322.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2329.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2338.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2342.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2663.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2665.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2677.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting-edge activity, and there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2685.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2687.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2689.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2698.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2704.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2714.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2723.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2733.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2745.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2841.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2846.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2861.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2861.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously, they're looking for educational leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2865.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2941.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2946.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2955.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2963.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2968.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2971.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2975.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2982.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2998.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3000.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3013.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3026.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3031.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is, remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3034.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3042.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we, you know, bring back some ideas and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3103.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Zizzo actually participated in a teleconference that was earlier in the year, and his contributions were such that they felt that they needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3184.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3193.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3199.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3201.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3208.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3218.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3225.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3261.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3273.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3282.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3287.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3289.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3406.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5001.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5010.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5016.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5019.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5029.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the various shop instructors, and they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5049.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5055.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5065.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5077.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5087.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5088.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5093.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5096.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5103.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5106.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5110.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5116.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: advisory committees to see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5120.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5124.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5131.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5141.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5154.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5158.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5162.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5167.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5194.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5196.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5204.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5207.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5217.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5229.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5232.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5233.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5235.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5554.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine can comment on that because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5557.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a quick idea and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=766.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=768.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since that time, grievances were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=770.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The processes of legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=773.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1011.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1012.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1331.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educating Foundation Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1337.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O'Toole Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1345.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1347.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1349.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1350.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2924.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2928.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2931.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2937.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2944.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2948.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2950.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2954.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2958.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2965.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Kieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2975.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2979.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3298.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, the program's a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3302.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3314.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting edge activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3317.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3322.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3324.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3326.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3335.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3340.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3351.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3354.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3370.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3381.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3478.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3482.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbitt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3497.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3498.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3579.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3583.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3591.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3599.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we're the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3605.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3608.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3612.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3618.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3635.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3636.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3650.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3663.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3668.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3670.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine, with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3679.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we bring back some ideas, and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3741.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Participated in a teleconference Earlier in the year and his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more let's say complete setting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3821.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3830.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3837.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was interesting, I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3845.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3855.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3862.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3898.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3910.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3919.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3924.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3926.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4043.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5638.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5647.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5653.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5656.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5666.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the very shop instructors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5675.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5686.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5692.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5702.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5714.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5725.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5729.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5733.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5740.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5743.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5747.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5753.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5756.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5760.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5768.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5778.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration of the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5791.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5795.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas, some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5804.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5831.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5833.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5841.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5844.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5844.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly business activities, mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5853.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5868.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5869.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5871.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6190.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6193.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6195.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=34.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously lock in doors, put kids in places, put people in key strategic locations to watch doors and corridors and any other possible area where someone might get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=43.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone follow that exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2834.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2836.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellson, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2841.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2845.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2851.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been around for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2853.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Advisory committees have been part of Chapter 74 for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2858.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2859.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee knows about Chapter 74 Advisory Committees, and many of you have participated on it, including Councilor Penter at one time, and others have been on these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2869.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an unknown thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2871.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one error that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2873.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was made without thinking it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2876.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was simply that advisory committees meet and they go over the program that they were interested in, the Multimedia Center for Students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2884.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2892.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2897.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2907.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2913.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do, so it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2923.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it was and it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2930.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2933.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2940.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2945.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no attempt to block anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2947.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2955.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2960.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As to the Corey check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2967.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they're together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2968.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they do a program together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2969.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2972.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they do that, then it would be good for them to know that the people who are going to be doing it in this space are people that we have checked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2982.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think safety is always on our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2984.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all agree on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2985.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2987.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an individual feels that the Cori check has been unduly denied, they have the right to get it and appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2994.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, do you think that any of us would ever be able to stand up in front of you and say that a person who had an insurance violation is a reason for denying them the right to come in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3003.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if a person has been involved with molestation, or the person been involved with assault and battery, and a person's been involved with destruction of property, maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3013.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3015.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think it's unreasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3017.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's something that we should consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3019.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3020.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think as far as Chapter 74 goes, despite what the individual has to say, it was totally different than the community media thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3028.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really a part of us making sure that we're in compliance with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3032.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can stick with the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3034.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3035.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we've posted all the meetings going forward to the advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3038.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every shop in the school has an advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3041.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3043.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of you have participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3044.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate that because it's important for the young people to get expertise, not only from Medford, but from practitioners around the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3051.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate your listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3052.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3054.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3504.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I may, just for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3506.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have football games at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3509.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So everyone comes through the gate, should be quarry checked because they might sit next to a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3522.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3524.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hormel Stadium is the site of student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3528.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have football kids there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3529.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have cheerleaders there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3531.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have other people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3532.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Public access, public areas are not subject to the CORI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3537.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it's direct, these key words, direct, unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3542.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I'm working with you, if I'm in the area where I'm working directly with you that's direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3549.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Indirect is not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3551.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People in areas you could be anywhere and have people who are near students and the like or near young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3558.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not the way the Corey statue has been interpreted and applied across the commonwealth, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3566.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we could check everybody out everywhere they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3568.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you go to the state house, you have to empty your pockets, you have to take off your belt, and you check everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3573.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can keep going and going and going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3576.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point in time, the terms are direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3581.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, every public gathering where there are young people and families would require everyone to be quarry checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3587.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3588.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just the way it's been interpreted across the Commonwealth, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would comment on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2874.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2882.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the Council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2886.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2910.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an unknown thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2911.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one error that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2913.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was made without thinking it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2924.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2932.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2937.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2947.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2953.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2962.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2964.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2965.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2970.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2973.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2980.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2986.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no attempt to block anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2987.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2995.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3000.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As to the CORI check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3007.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they're together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3008.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they do a program together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3010.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3012.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they do that, then it would be good for them to know that the people who are going to be doing it in this space are people that we have checked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3022.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think safety is always on our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3024.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all agree on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3026.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3027.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an individual feels that the Cori check has been unduly denied, they have the right to get it and appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3035.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, do you think that any of us would ever be able to stand up in front of you and say that a person who had an insurance violation is a reason for denying them the right to come in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3043.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if a person has been involved with molestation or the person been involved with assault and battery and a person been involved with destruction of property, maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3054.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3055.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think it's unreasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3057.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's something that we should consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3059.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3061.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think as far as Chapter 74 goes, despite what the individual has to say, it was totally different than the community media thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3068.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really a part of us making sure that we're in compliance with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3072.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can stay on the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3074.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3075.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we've posted all the meetings going forward to the advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3078.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every shop in the school has an advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3082.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3083.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and some of you have participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3085.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate that because it's important for the young people to get expertise, not only from Medford, but from practitioners around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3091.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3093.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3544.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I may, just for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3546.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have football games at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3549.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So everyone comes through the gate, should be quarry checked, because they might sit next to a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3558.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hormel Stadium is a site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3565.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hormel Stadium is the site of student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3568.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have football kids there, we have cheerleaders there, we have other people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3572.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Public access, public areas are not subject to the quarry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3577.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it's direct, these key words, direct, unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3583.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I'm working with you, if I'm in the area where I'm working directly with you, that's direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3590.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Indirect is not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3592.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People in areas, you could be anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3595.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and have people who are near students and the like, or near young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3599.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not the way the Corey statue has been interpreted and has been applied across the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3606.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we could check everybody out everywhere they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3608.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you go to the statehouse, you have to empty your pockets, you have to take off your belt, and you check everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3614.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can keep going and going and going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3616.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point in time, the terms are direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3621.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, every public gathering, whether young people and families, would require everyone to be quarry checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3627.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3629.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just the way it's been interpreted across the Commonwealth, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would comment on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=196.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirsten's not here, but I. Oh, maybe you can help me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=224.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations, a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two, the teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=239.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line and those line items is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=252.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=255.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=256.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=257.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=262.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=265.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=326.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is for the hockey clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=353.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=359.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and the check is made out to the conference Strictly for her, you know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL we now belong to the Northeast Conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=397.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=406.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=451.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=455.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=459.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=462.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=659.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=707.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=710.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=715.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=718.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=782.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would suggest that you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=789.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1387.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1392.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1394.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1396.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1398.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1401.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1410.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1413.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1416.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1427.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1443.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1445.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1449.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1454.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1462.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1471.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1478.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1484.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1489.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1501.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1503.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1507.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1511.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1513.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1515.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1516.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1517.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1520.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1529.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1532.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1536.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1543.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1553.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all, and that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1555.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1559.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1561.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1565.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1566.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1568.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1570.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1571.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1577.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1578.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2353.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2356.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate, but I can't let one thing go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2363.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2370.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2376.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2381.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2383.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2385.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate, so ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2393.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2396.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2398.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2399.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2402.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2405.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2406.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2409.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2410.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2414.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2415.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, OK, you came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2417.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2421.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2424.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2426.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2434.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2435.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2455.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't wanna go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2456.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2461.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2464.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2470.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2481.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3234.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3238.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3251.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3273.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity, and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3289.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this program, Credit for Life, is one of the initiatives out of the state treasurer's office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so that we can have this Credit for Life Fair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3303.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity, so I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3667.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3679.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Report on game change anti-violence partnership grant from New England Patriots Foundation So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3695.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us who is our supervisor of health and physical education actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3701.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program as we all know that you know young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3712.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but they like to be associated with that and I think this is a really important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3716.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3717.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3727.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've gotta move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3729.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3731.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material, a trainer's guide, some selected portions of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3736.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the whole thing would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3738.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3741.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports-related kind of terminology in it, so it's like talking trash scenario, you know, the kinds of things like that, or, you know, being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3751.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people, and we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4678.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4683.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4688.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4694.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4716.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4725.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4736.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4744.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4754.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4766.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4773.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4776.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4786.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we had two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4793.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4795.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4803.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4806.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4812.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time It's only been built three times So I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4839.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4842.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4845.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4882.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4896.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4897.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4898.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4900.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4902.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of, and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4909.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency, and I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4923.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4928.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4934.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4936.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4937.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4943.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4945.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades, the Bruins bear, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4946.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat, the Patriot, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4948.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4950.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4955.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4956.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5080.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5085.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5099.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross validate across the various reports and this also plays into the student reporting to homes and homes reporting back to faculty members and the like so it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5115.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5121.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5123.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5124.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5132.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5134.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5154.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5157.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5159.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5229.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5303.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5307.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5327.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5333.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over a thousand people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5337.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5347.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5349.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5351.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply is a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5355.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5357.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5359.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5364.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5367.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5372.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5384.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5389.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5390.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5394.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5399.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5485.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Tony is here and you know I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5491.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5492.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the globe about concussions and things like this and you know we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5502.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know we'll do this together and there's just a lot of factors about you see in the news today about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5510.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5513.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5517.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well, and it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5527.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5531.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5532.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports, and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5538.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5544.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that, you know, has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5551.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5553.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5555.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5557.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5560.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5562.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5569.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5574.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5577.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5581.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5585.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5590.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5592.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5595.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5602.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5606.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5615.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5624.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you might have, you're hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5629.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, a lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5634.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5636.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5641.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we track this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5643.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5645.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5794.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5800.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5803.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5816.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5821.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5845.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6043.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6048.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6051.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6055.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6060.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6235.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6239.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6243.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are subpoenas out there for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6245.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have sent evidence over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6246.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll let you know what's going on with that, despite the fact that some people think we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6253.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's done by the DA's office, not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6257.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, earlier this evening, a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6263.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6265.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6267.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to tell you about that because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6271.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Chapter 74 Vocational Advisory Committee on Multimedia met in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6279.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were never postings for those kinds of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6282.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6284.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6291.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6297.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it, but he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6309.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings, we've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6320.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6322.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also on the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6326.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6328.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6331.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6339.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6342.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6345.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6363.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6365.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6367.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6382.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6387.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are, the interpretation is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6390.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6392.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6394.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6396.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6399.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6401.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6411.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6415.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are significant to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6426.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6464.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6484.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6497.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6499.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6501.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6512.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6517.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6595.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=156.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirstine's not here, but I... Oh, maybe you can help me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=183.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=198.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=211.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=214.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=215.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=217.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=222.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=224.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=285.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is for the hockey clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=313.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=319.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference, and the check is made out to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=326.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's strictly for her, you know, for the FIFA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=330.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of the GBL, we now belong to the Northeast Conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=356.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=364.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so let me look at what I've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=367.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=370.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=410.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=414.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=418.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=421.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=614.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting and get that straightened away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=619.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=663.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=666.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=671.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=674.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=738.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed, and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=745.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1341.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1347.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1349.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1350.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1353.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1355.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1364.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1367.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1370.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1381.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1397.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1399.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1403.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1408.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1411.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1417.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1418.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we did talk to union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1421.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1426.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1432.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1439.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1443.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1456.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement, that's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1462.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1466.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1468.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it, we'll come down, we'll have a nice meeting, we'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1474.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place including deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1484.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1486.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1490.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1497.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1507.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all and that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1509.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you, not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1516.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1519.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1521.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1522.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1524.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1526.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1532.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1533.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1534.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1535.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2305.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate, but I can't let one thing go I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2314.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2316.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know we met and we had discussions and we brought people in and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2321.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2327.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet and it could have brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2333.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2335.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2337.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is, what this is, is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2343.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So ownership, good results happen when everyone takes ownership of the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2348.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2349.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2350.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2354.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2357.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win, the school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2360.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2362.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2366.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2367.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2373.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2375.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2378.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2385.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2387.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2407.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2408.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the deputy superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2413.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2416.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2421.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2432.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3184.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3189.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report, I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3201.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3223.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3224.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity, and financial literacy is extremely important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3235.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3239.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this program, Credit for Life, is one of the initiatives out of the state treasurer's office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so that we can have this Credit for Life Fair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3252.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3264.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccardelli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3617.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file, and we're going to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3634.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3640.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3645.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3651.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3653.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3661.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, I bet they like to be associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3664.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think this is a really important thing because it not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3667.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about, you know, how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3677.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3678.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3681.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material, a trainer's guide, some selected portions of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3685.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the whole thing would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3688.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3690.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports-related kind of terminology in it, so it's like talking trash scenario, you know, the kinds of things like that, or, you know, being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3701.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3704.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4625.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4628.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4629.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there, and we went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4635.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4641.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts, sometimes the preservation of small things that are out of school, that are historic, or from schools that are no longer there that might enhance the existing schools, or projects of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4655.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to remember, too, that this is not just a one-time thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4658.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4663.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4673.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also should be looking at, if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4683.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward on a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4691.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4702.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4714.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4720.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4723.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which is filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4733.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4741.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4743.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4750.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4754.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4760.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was rebuilt one more time, and it's now being rebuilt for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4764.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only been built three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4766.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I mean, it's kind of interesting to go back and see that Matthew Craddock never, ever came to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4771.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the bridge is named after Matthew Crack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4772.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4776.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office, there's a very interesting plaque there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4781.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It talks about Medford's history, the home of rum and crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4785.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4787.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4789.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll leave it to your imaginations as to what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4792.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know, the Medford Cracker was particular to Medford, but it had a split down the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4799.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reason it's called the Cracker is when you broke it, it had a cracking sound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4804.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we're the home of crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4806.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes that shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4830.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4843.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4844.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4846.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4848.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4850.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of, and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4857.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4869.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4870.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4876.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4882.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4883.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4884.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4891.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4892.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades, the Bruins bear, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4894.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat, the Patriot, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4895.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4897.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4902.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4904.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4998.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that people in tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5027.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5032.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5046.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5054.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5060.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5063.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with School Brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5068.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5070.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5072.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5079.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5081.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5101.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5101.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5104.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know, you won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5177.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5251.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5255.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5274.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5281.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5284.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5294.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5296.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5298.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5302.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5304.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5306.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5311.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5314.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5320.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5331.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5336.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5338.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5341.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, a piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5346.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5432.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does Perry love concussion law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5434.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony is here, and I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5439.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5440.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the Globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5441.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fantastic, I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5443.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About concussions and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5445.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a trainer, we have a doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5447.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although the doctor is leaving, we're going to have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5450.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5450.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5452.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's just a lot of factors about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5455.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see in the news today about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5457.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The trauma caused by brain injuries, the Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5464.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5469.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5474.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5480.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every year there are injuries in all the sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5482.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They range from broken bones to cuts and to other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5492.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5498.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5500.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5502.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5505.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5507.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5510.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, that often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5516.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5522.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5525.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5528.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5532.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5537.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5539.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5542.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5549.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5553.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5562.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5572.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5577.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5581.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5583.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5589.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We track this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5590.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5592.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5729.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: EDUARDO By the way, over the three year period there were 58 different identifications of concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5739.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5748.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5750.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5764.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5767.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'd have to go through the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5768.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5792.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5793.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5990.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing and getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5995.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5998.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: counseling in the nurse's office, talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well, because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6007.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6183.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6186.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6190.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over, and we'll let you know what's going on with that, despite the fact that some people think, you know, we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6200.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6201.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done by the DA's office, not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6204.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6205.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, earlier this evening, a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6210.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6211.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6212.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6214.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The open meeting law, I'm going to tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6218.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Chapter 74 Vocational Advisory Committee on Multimedia met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6224.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the past, there were never, you know, postings for those kinds of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6229.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6231.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6239.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it was done very innocently by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6243.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by Heidi and her team, and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it, but he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6256.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings, we've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6267.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6270.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6273.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6275.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6278.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city of the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6287.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6290.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6292.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6310.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6312.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6315.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6328.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6329.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived at public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6334.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6339.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6341.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6343.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6346.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6348.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6359.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6360.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6362.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that slipped by the boards and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6411.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6431.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6435.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One's at 6, one's at 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6446.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6448.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6453.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6459.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6464.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6543.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=187.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=202.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=215.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=218.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=219.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=221.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=226.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=228.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=317.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=322.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and check is made out to the conference Okay, cuz yeah, it just strictly for her You know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=335.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We now belongs to the Northeast conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=360.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=370.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=415.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=418.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=422.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=425.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=622.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=671.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=673.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=678.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=682.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=745.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=753.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1350.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1355.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1358.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1359.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1362.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1364.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1373.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1376.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1379.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1390.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1393.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1406.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1408.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1412.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1417.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1425.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1435.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1441.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1447.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1452.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1465.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1466.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1470.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1475.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1477.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1478.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1479.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1480.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1483.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1493.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1495.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1499.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1506.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1516.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1517.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1518.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1522.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1524.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1528.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1529.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1531.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1533.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1534.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1543.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1544.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2315.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent so I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate But I can't let one thing go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2326.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2333.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2339.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2344.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2347.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2348.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2354.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So ownership, good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2360.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2361.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2362.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2366.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2368.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2370.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2372.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2373.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2377.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2379.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2384.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2387.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2389.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2397.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2399.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2418.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2419.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2425.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2428.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2433.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2444.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3197.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3202.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3214.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3236.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way, so this program credit for life is one of the initiatives out of the state Treasurer's Office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so we can have this credit for life there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3266.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3277.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3630.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3648.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3653.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3658.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3664.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3666.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3676.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they like to be associated with that, and I think this is a really important thing, because it not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3680.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3690.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3692.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3694.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3697.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A trainer's guide, some selected portions of the whole thing because it would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3701.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3704.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports related kind of terminology in it, so like talking trash scenario, the kinds of things like that, or being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3715.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3717.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4641.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4646.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4651.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4657.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might Enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4679.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three, because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4688.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice if we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4707.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4717.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community, and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4729.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled, I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4739.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4749.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4756.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4758.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4766.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4769.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4775.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4780.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only been built three times So, I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4802.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4805.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4808.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4845.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4859.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4860.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4861.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4863.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4866.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4872.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4884.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4886.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4891.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4897.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4899.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4900.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4906.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4908.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades of Bruins Bear was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4909.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat the Patriot was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4911.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4913.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4918.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4919.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5014.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that people at tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5043.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5048.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5062.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5070.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5076.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5078.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5084.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5086.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5087.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5095.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5097.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5117.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5120.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5122.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5193.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5266.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5270.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5290.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5296.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5300.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5310.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5312.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5314.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5317.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5320.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5322.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5327.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5330.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5335.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5347.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5352.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5353.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5357.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5362.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5448.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, but Tony is here and you know, I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5454.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight, it's in the Globe, about concussions and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5461.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving, we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5465.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up Tony, you know, we'll do this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5468.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's just a lot of factors about, you see in the notes today about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5473.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5476.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5480.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5485.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5490.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5495.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5501.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5507.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5514.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee, things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5516.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5518.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5520.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5523.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5525.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5532.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5537.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5540.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5544.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5548.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5553.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5555.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5558.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5565.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5569.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5578.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5587.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5592.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5597.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up, and I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5604.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We track this every year, and I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5608.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5747.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, over the three-year period, there were 58 different identifications of concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5754.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5763.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5766.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5780.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5783.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'd have to go through the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5784.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5808.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6006.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6011.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6014.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6018.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6023.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6198.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6202.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court and you know there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over and we'll let you know what's going on with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6211.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Despite the fact that some people think you know we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6216.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't, it's done by the DA's office not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6219.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6220.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is early this evening a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6226.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6228.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law, I'm gonna tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6234.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chapter 74 vocational advisory committee on multimedia met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6240.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the past, there were never postings for those kinds of meetings, it's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6247.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6254.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6260.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6265.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6272.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6278.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6283.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6285.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6289.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6291.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6294.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6302.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6305.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6308.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6326.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6328.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6330.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6343.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6345.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6350.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6353.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6355.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6357.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6359.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6362.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6364.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6374.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6378.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6389.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6427.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6447.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6461.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's hard, we're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6464.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6475.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6480.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know, obviously it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6559.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can designate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=493.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=494.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellison, superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=495.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=501.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=506.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=511.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we were able to maintain good class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=515.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=528.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=539.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=541.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in space availability and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=545.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had 3 in regular classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=556.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=565.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, overall, I think we're in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=569.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=584.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=590.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that may be required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=596.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes people come into the community with a tremendous need, and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=605.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=608.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's sort of like a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=609.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=625.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=635.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=640.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we moved the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=649.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=651.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=658.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=664.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's, you know, it's important that you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=667.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=684.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't know if it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=685.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue around the state or in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=704.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those are the big concerns and I think the development it can go hand in hand without impacting the schools But naturally we always pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=711.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=712.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=731.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 21.5 at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=737.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=738.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the McGlynn, if I look at the latest numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=740.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking at the actual number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=742.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, you're looking at the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's by choice of the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Principal might, from time to time, decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well, and there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=781.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=787.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one, can afford it, and two, that might have sufficient space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=793.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seemed to be they were looking for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=795.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=911.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=921.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that a contractual requirement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=922.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a contractual requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=923.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=931.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=941.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=944.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=953.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=967.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=971.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No paraprofessionals covering any classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=975.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=985.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=986.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just depends what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=987.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1005.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no limit to what it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1007.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a need and budget related thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1009.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, it really depends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1010.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, today, you know, we talked about a particular student who has real needs and we added one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1017.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1021.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1027.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we move somebody over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1028.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's always a juggle because obviously everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1152.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might see another 50 students in the schools across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1156.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at least the way it's normally the pattern is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1160.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We started before September, we got pre-Labor Day, and that has an impact on some families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1166.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families just want to take the extra days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1168.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people don't get wound until they actually hit September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1172.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that first week is sort of that thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1175.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1183.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's much lighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1189.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1192.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look on October 1st, that's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1200.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1203.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=633.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=641.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=646.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=652.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we were able to maintain good class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=656.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=668.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=680.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=682.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in space availability and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=686.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had three in regular classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=697.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=706.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, overall, I think we're in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=710.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=725.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=731.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that are maybe required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=737.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes people come into the community with a tremendous need and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=745.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=748.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's sort of like a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=750.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=766.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=776.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=780.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we move the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=789.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=791.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=799.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=804.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's, you know, it's important that you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=807.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=824.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't know if it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=826.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety, or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=841.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: around the state or in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=843.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the big concerns, and I think the development can go hand in hand without impacting the schools, but naturally we always pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=852.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=853.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=854.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=862.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's 23 there, but I'll take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=865.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think any class is that high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=878.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=880.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I look at the latest numbers, if you're looking at the actual number or you're looking at the numbers, that's by choice of the, of the principle principle might from time to time decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=894.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=921.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=928.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one can afford it, and two that might have sufficient space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=934.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems to be they're looking for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=936.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1052.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school, up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1063.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a contractual requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1064.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1072.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1146.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no limit to what it's allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1147.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a need and budget-related thing.<br><br>
